In 2015, the then chancellor George Osborne introduced rights allowing individuals to move their defined benefit pension scheme to a defined contribution pot.\n\nMore than 100,000 transfers were undertaken in the five years after that, according to LCP, and six-figure transfer values were the norm. In many cases these transfers were undertaken specifically so the value of those pension pots could be passed on when the member died.\n\nIn last year\u2019s Budget, chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that unused pension funds will be included within IHT from April 2027.\n\n\u201cApplying inheritance tax to pension balances could prove to be a real gold mine for the government for many years to come,\u201d said Tim Camfield, senior consultant at LCP, who carried out the analysis.\n\nWhile he acknowledged that some retirees may react to tax changes by drawing down on pension assets faster, the changes will still generate significant tax revenue because such withdrawals will be subject to income tax, he said.\n\n\u201cEither way, as the DB transfer generation gets older, the government will start to see a multibillion pound revenue stream from the income tax or IHT on their pension pots,\u201d Camfield added.\n\nAccording to a freedom of information request from investment platform Interactive Investor to the Office for Budget Responsibility, an estimated 31,200 more estates will be subject to IHT in the three years from the 2027-28 tax year than if pensions had not been included in estates.\n\nThe OBR estimates that 66,600 people will pay inheritance tax in 2029-30, up from 40,100 in the current tax year.\n\nLCP calculates that these numbers should continue to surge because the peak in transfer activity from DB schemes to DC schemes was in 2017-18, after which tighter rules around financial advice followed by a fall in transfer values led to a dramatic reduction in the volume of transfers.\n\nThe typical person who transferred was in their late fifties, according to LCP. As these people gradually die over the coming years, any unspent balances in their transferred pension fund will be potentially liable to IHT.\n\nRob Morgan, chief analyst at wealth manager Charles Stanley, said that enhanced death benefits tended to be \u201cthe overriding factor\u201d for people choosing to transfer out of DB into DC.\n\n\u201cOn the basis that people will mostly have only done this where there is ample income and assets elsewhere, we can infer that there will be IHT consequences in many cases,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nData from the Financial Conduct Authority shows that between April 2015 and September 2018, more than 170,000 people who received advice transferred their DB scheme to a DC pot, with an average transfer value of over \u00a3350,000. This suggests the total amount transferred in this period was over \u00a350bn.\n\nShaun Moore, tax and financial planning expert at Quilter, a wealth manager, said a freeze in the inheritance tax threshold \u2014 which is set to last until 2030 \u2014 plus the inclusion of pensions from 2027 would enable the government to \u201ccash in on an ever-expanding pool of taxpayers\u201d.\n\nThe IHT tax-free threshold has been set at \u00a3325,000 since 2009. The impact of the frozen threshold alongside inflation and rising asset values means more people have been dragged into paying inheritance tax, with the trend likely to continue.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6608ece0-7522-4f36-b1f0-d1ff66c269c3"}, {"uuid4": "6943abbe-d57d-4771-baf9-8cf6ae731472", "title": "Defined benefit pension reform \u2018unlikely to be silver bullet\u2019 say trustees", "description": "UK government argue that funds should release surpluses back to companies for investment", "author": "Mary McDougall", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.767Z", "content": "Pension trustees warn that allowing companies to access surpluses trapped in defined benefit pension schemes is unlikely to deliver the jolt to the economy that the government hopes for.\n\nThe UK government said this week that lifting the restrictions on companies using money from their DB pension schemes \u2014 in excess of what they owe members \u2014 would \u201cunlock billions to drive growth\u201d.\n\nAccording to an FT analysis of company accounts there are over 30 companies in the FTSE 100 with DB schemes with surpluses of at least \u00a3100mn and a funding ratio of at least 110 per cent. Most declined to comment when contacted by the FT.\n\nEnergy company SSE said it was looking at the opportunities the reforms represent, but noted any impact would be relatively small.\n\nSchroders said after the announcement its would use \u2018\u2019approximately 10 per cent\u2019\u2019 of its scheme\u2019s DB section\u2019s surplus per year to support funding for defined contribution members.\n\nMost schemes can already access surpluses in their DB schemes, provided they passed a resolution in 2016 permitting them to do so, according to pensions consultant LCP. But in practice few do.\n\nOnly \u00a3180mn of surplus was accessed by companies between 2018 to 2023, according to government estimates last year. Any surplus extracted is taxed at a rate of 25 per cent, having been lowered from 35 per cent last year.\n\nWhere DB and DC pension funds are set up within the same trust, DB surpluses can be transferred to DC members if the scheme rules permit it without incurring a tax charge.\n\nTrade groups have broadly welcomed the government\u2019s proposals, provided appropriate guardrails are in place to protect members, but trustees have privately expressed doubts.\n\n\u201cWhy would I want to give away my comfort blanket?\u201d said one trustee of a FTSE 100 company pension scheme. He was sceptical that he would be prepared to release its surplus to executives, noting that for many years the scheme was in deficit and a fall in government bond yields could make its funding position more vulnerable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the silver bullet that the government hopes for,\u201d said another, adding that the total DB scheme surplus was only about \u00a368bn on a buyout basis \u2014 the level at which companies with the right permissions can access their surpluses.\n\n\u201cFirst you have to work out how much to give members, then you have to agree how much to give the company factoring you will have to pay 25 per cent tax,\u201d he said, adding that the time it takes to make these decisions was also \u201cnot trivial\u201d.\n\nRob Gardner, former co-chief executive of pensions consultancy Redington and founder of Rebalance Earth, a flood mitigation investor, said if he were a trustee weighing the return of a surplus to an employer there would be \u201csignificant challenges\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy fiduciary duty is to act in the best interests of members, and the potential long-term risks to them may outweigh the short-term benefits to the employer,\u201d he said.\n\nThe government estimates that around 75 per cent of the UK\u2019s \u00a31.2tn defined benefit corporate pension schemes are in surplus, worth a total of around \u00a3160bn. Some 96 per cent of these schemes \u2014 which provide pensions to 8.8mn people \u2014 are closed to new members.\n\nMinisters have been working out how to extract money from DB schemes after a rapid rise in interest rates radically improved scheme funding levels in 2022. The government\u2019s plans follow a consultation by the Conservative government last spring.\n\nPolicymakers also hope trustees will be emboldened to invest in more risky assets, rather than preparing schemes to be sold to insurance companies in a process known as buyout.\n\nBut Sankar Mahalingham, managing director at professional trustee firm Law Debenture, said it was \u201cunlikely that there will be a large number who will suddenly take a very different look at their investment strategy\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Pension Protection Fund, schemes had a net deficit on a buyout basis of almost \u00a3500bn as recently as 2019. That figure is now a surplus of \u00a368bn.\n\nWhen the Financial Times asked the Treasury if it would lower the \u2018buyout basis\u2019 threshold, a spokesperson said that \u201cschemes will continue to have to satisfy stringent funding requirements to be eligible to extract surplus\u201d.\n\nThe previous government\u2019s consultation explored enhancing protection from the Pension Protection Fund to 100 per cent to encourage trustees to be more comfortable with taking on more risk and releasing surpluses, as well as assessing if the tax rate for tapping surpluses should be lowered.\n\nThe Treasury told the FT it would set out these details \u201cin the spring\u201d.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c4df1f70-dd8d-4876-aa35-5d189657be66"}, {"uuid4": "b0074adb-26d0-4c00-8165-dcba22621fdd", "title": "Starmer refuses to tear up workers\u2019 rights bill as compromises loom ", "description": "Prime minister will listen to business over exact details, as some within Labour push for \u2018serious tooth removal\u2019  ", "author": "Jim Pickard", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.714Z", "content": "Sir Keir Starmer is resisting pressure from business and some within his own party to tear up a new workers\u2019 rights bill, even as government officials conceded that details of the policy were still up for grabs.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s allies told the Financial Times he was fully committed to the \u201cmake work pay\u201d plan, which is seen in Number 10 as essential to tackling low pay, improving insecure employment and raising productivity even though it is expected to cost businesses \u00a35bn.\n\nBut senior Labour figures argue it may have to be made more business-friendly in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cIt needs serious tooth removal,\u201d said one Labour official close to Starmer. Another influential adviser said: \u201cThere is a view in the Treasury and DBT [business and trade department] that this shouldn\u2019t upset the growth apple cart too much.\u201d\n\nThe workers\u2019 rights package was a key promise in Labour\u2019s manifesto, but business leaders have warned that piling even more costs on to companies will imperil the growth ambitions that Starmer and chancellor Rachel Reeves have set out as their core mission for the government.\n\nStarmer insisted in the House of Commons this week he would not abandon the principles of the legislation. \u201cWe believe in giving people proper dignity and protection at work,\u201d he said, calling the bill \u201cgood for working people and good for the economy\u201d.\n\nOne Starmer aide said: \u201cWe want the economy to grow and are prepared to take on the political fights to get that, but we also want some of the proceeds of growth to flow into the pockets of workers, especially tackling low pay and insecure employment.\u201d\n\nThe aide added: \u201cWe have consulted on the application of how we do that. So the measures may adjust to reflect that policy objective, but they will not limit our ambitions.\u201d\n\nMinisters are consulting businesses, unions and others on details of the Employment Rights bill, which is due to report to the House of Commons before Easter, in an increasingly tense political atmosphere.\n\nBusinesses are already smarting from last year\u2019s tax-raising Budget and a hike in the minimum wage that comes into force this April, while companies such as J Sainsbury and Airbus have already blamed higher costs for recent job cuts in the UK.\n\nNicola Smith, director of policy at the Trades Union Congress, said she believed ministers had strengthened their commitment to some parts of the bill, including a near-ban on employers using \u201cfire and rehire\u201d tactics to impose changes in contracts, which the legislation will allow only where a business is close to insolvency.\n\n\u201cFrom where I\u2019m sitting, we don\u2019t see any change of ambition,\u201d she added.\n\nThe proposals in the controversial package include scaling back zero-hours contracts and giving staff full rights of redress from their first day of employment.\n\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch this week branded it the \u201cunemployment bill\u201d and called on Starmer to ditch the entire package.\n\nOne imminent compromise will see ministers address concerns that employers could find themselves in endless consultation with unions over unconnected redundancies at different sites under the legislation as currently drafted.\n\nAt present, they are required to consult only when they make 20 or more workers redundant at a single site.\n\nMinisters have said they will bring forward amendments to the bill at the next stage of the parliamentary process \u2014 and both business and unions believe the timing of this next stage could slip into March.\n\nCraig Beaumont of the Federation of Small Businesses said two areas of focus for business lobbyists were around the proposals for day one protection against unfair dismissal, and the mechanism of the proposed \u201cban\u201d on exploitative zero and low hour contracts. However, he acknowledged the FSB was \u201cpitching for the stars\u201d in urging ministers to change the day one right to a protection that kicked in after a year.\n\nAngela Rayner, deputy prime minister and champion of the bill, has told colleagues that the idea of improving workers\u2019 rights is one of the Labour government\u2019s few popular policies, and a key weapon in the party\u2019s fight against Reform UK in working class seats.\n\n\u201cThe government is committed to implementing day one rights, ending insecurity, and strengthening the voice of working people,\u201d said one ally of Rayner.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4eb5e8ca-aba5-4426-8dce-4410dd313330"}, {"uuid4": "f99ab84b-28f2-4c3e-b9b6-c7c6bdb68575", "title": "City firms urge Rachel Reeves to curb cash Isas", "description": "Companies have told chancellor that scaling back tax breaks on savings accounts could boost UK financial services", "author": "Akila Quinio", "published_date": "2025-01-31T21:03:24.005Z", "content": "Big City firms are urging Rachel Reeves to scale back tax breaks for cash Isas, a form of saving beloved by millions of Britons, in an effort to boost UK financial services and the economy by channelling money into stocks.\n\nCompanies including insurance group Phoenix and the London Stock Exchange Group have told the chancellor that almost \u00a3300bn held in cash Isas could generate better returns for savers if invested in stocks and shares, while supporting the City\u2019s dwindling equities market.\n\nOne senior banker said the issue had been raised by several finance executives at a recent meeting with Reeves and that she had not rebuffed the idea.\n\n\u201cThe state should not be giving a tax break for us all to park our money in cash,\u201d said Andy Briggs, chief executive of Phoenix, which operates the Standard Life brand.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that Rachel Reeves will conclude that it makes sense to refocus Isa tax incentives to make them consistent with the government\u2019s very welcome growth agenda,\u201d added Briggs, who was at the meeting.\n\nScrapping the cash Isa would be the biggest shake-up of the savings market since the products were first introduced by then-Labour chancellor Gordon Brown in 1999.\n\nCash Isas allow savers to earn tax-free interest on up to \u00a320,000 a year and are by far the most popular of the UK\u2019s Isas.

A further 9 per cent will need to change to accommodate climate benefits, such as sustainable farming practices.\n\nThe National Farmers\u2019 Union has warned that the sector is already being forced to scale back food production in favour of alternatives such as rewilding or growing crops for biofuels in order to keep their businesses viable.\n\nLosing additional farming land would also increase the UK\u2019s dependence on imported foodstuffs.\n\nThe estimates were published as part of the government\u2019s consultation into a long-awaited \u201cland use framework\u201d that aims to balance competing demands on England\u2019s land, from housing and renewable energy to food production and nature restoration.\n\n\u201cThe primary purpose of farming will always be to produce the food that feeds the nation,\u201d said environment secretary Steve Reed. He stressed that the framework would help decision makers protect \u201cour highest quality agricultural land and make decisions about the long-term future of farm businesses\u201d.\n\nAlongside the estimates, the government said that any impact on food production from the land use changes could be offset by using technology and sustainable farming techniques to increase crop yields.\n\nSuccessive governments have shied away from embarking on the framework over fears of the backlash it would receive from farmers.\n\nNFU president Tom Bradshaw said: \u201cWe must have a land use plan in place, underpinned by sound science and evidence, that has British food at its heart.\u201d\n\nBut Victoria Vyvyan, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said it could mean farmers being told \u201cwhat they are and aren\u2019t allowed to grow, plant and rear on their land\u201d and called for safeguards to prevent \u201cmission creep\u201d from officials.\n\n\u201cWhenever the state gets involved, its tendency is to only become ever more prescriptive,\u201d she added. \u201cToday, the framework might be light touch, but tomorrow it won\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nLiberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael, chair of the cross-party environment, food and rural affairs committee, said the framework was \u201clong overdue\u201d.\n\n\u201cFarmers need to be able to plan ahead and they and other stakeholders have long called for clarity amidst a myriad of often conflicting demands,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo-thirds of England\u2019s land is agricultural, according to official statistics, with 38 per cent made up of arable land and 29 per cent grassland. The country\u2019s population is predominantly urban, with 83 per cent of people living in built-up areas.\n\nEngland\u2019s farmers are already under pressure from the impact of heavy flooding, high inflation and huge cuts to their subsidy payments.\n\nMany are also furious about the Labour government\u2019s decision to\u00a0overturn inheritance tax rules, which means some will be liable to pay tax on inherited agricultural and business assets that were previously exempt.\n\nFarmers also face a shift to a new post-Brexit subsidy scheme that offers them incentives to restore the natural environment, sometimes at the expense of food production.\n\nThe Environmental Land Management schemes, or ELMs, provide payments for farmers to adopt sustainable farming practices such as soil management, or to take land out of farming altogether. Scotland and Wales have separate devolved systems.\n\nThe schemes have been criticised by farming groups such as the NFU, which say farmers are being paid to inadvertently lower the country\u2019s food production, despite the last government\u2019s commitment to maintaining food self-sufficiency.\n\nThe sector had hoped that a land use framework would offer clarity about the intentions behind farming policy.\n\nDowning Street said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to be clear that this isn\u2019t about the government dictating how land is used, or taking valuable, productive land away from farms.\n\n\u201cThe government recognises that land is in high demand, and that is why we are starting a national conversation with those involved, whether it be landowners, farmers, developers and more, about how we use it to its full potential, not least for food production.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9581872d-d6b8-4db4-b58f-698507644ddc"}, {"uuid4": "8b3ef67c-5085-46a4-b15d-9eb85059a019", "title": "UK to rely on skewed US trade figures to skirt Trump tariffs ", "description": "Long-standing statistical quirk means both sides report a trade surplus with the other ", "author": "Valentina Romei", "published_date": "2025-02-01T12:21:05.495Z", "content": "Sir Keir Starmer is using a long-standing statistical quirk to bolster his attempts to fend off Donald Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs, relying on US data that shows the UK is one of the few major economies with which America has a trade surplus.\n\nBritish ministers are focusing on the US data in their discussions with officials in the Trump administration, because its methodology is more helpful to their cause than the UK\u2019s own statistics.\n\n\u201cUsing America\u2019s own trade data provides a shared and strong foundation when engaging in discussions with our American friends,\u201d joked one senior British official.\n\nAccording to US figures, America ran an overall trade surplus with the UK in 2023, amounting to $14.5bn. That puts Britain in a favourable position as Trump threatens tariffs targeting countries with significant deficits.\n\nHowever, the Office for National Statistics reports that the UK ran a trade surplus with the US of \u00a371.4bn, or around $89bn, in 2023.\n\nTrump has threatened punitive tariffs on countries with which the US runs trade deficits, though his focus appears to be goods rather than services.\n\nWhile the bulk of the UK trade balance with the US is services, in 2023, the country reported a small goods trade surplus with the US of about $3bn. This still contrasts with the $9.7bn goods trade surplus the US reports with the UK.\n\nStarmer and Lord Mandelson, the new UK ambassador to Washington, are arguing that Trump should spare Britain from any general application of tariffs given the trading position between the two countries.\n\nThe statistics offices across the Atlantic are aware of the differences and have been co-operating to realign the data since 2017. Both highlighted how the differences are larger when measuring trade in services.\n\nTrade asymmetries are common and differences \u201ccan be caused by a range of conceptual and measurement variations between the estimation practices of different countries,\u201d warned the ONS.\n\nA key issue in the UK-US figures is the treatment of Crown Dependencies, the three offshore island territories in the British Islands that are self-governing possessions of the British Crown.\n\nThe US Bureau of Economic Analysis includes trade with Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man in the UK data, while the ONS does not.\n\nGiven that Jersey alone hosts over 35,000 financial firms managing more than \u00a3450bn in assets, this omission has a material impact.\n\nThe US reports exporting $4.8bn more in services to the UK than it imports, while the UK claims to export nearly \u00a370bn more to the US than it imports.\n\nThe UK said the exclusion of the Crown Dependencies from the UK trade data is in line with the European System of Accounts.\n\nThe US Statistics Office said it \u201cwill explore the feasibility of modifying its data collection instruments to exclude these dependencies from its geographic definition of the United Kingdom\u201d. This is something many UK officials might not want to happen just yet.\n\nAn analysis by HM Revenue & Customs into US-UK trade asymmetries on vehicles does seem to not settle the issue.\n\nBefore 2022, US-origin goods that cleared EU customs in another EU country before coming to the UK were counted as European imports. This makes it harder to compare with US data.\n\n\u201cThis explains the negative asymmetry,\u201d the analysis stated.\n\nThe study refers to negative asymmetries when US exports of vehicles to the UK are larger than the corresponding UK imports from the US.\n\nFrom 2022, UK imports from the US on a country-of-origin basis should be comparable with US exports to the UK. \u201cInstead, there is positive asymmetry in 2022, which cannot be explained,\u201d concluded the analysis.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b7c434eb-e634-44a7-9997-4781196f6638"}, {"uuid4": "9282f0e6-0ab3-456a-a4fb-8d5b67a4f366", "title": "Retirees can struggle to shift the \u2018saver mindset\u2019", "description": "Spend or save is a tricky balancing act as we age", "author": "Moira O'Neill", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.744Z", "content": "After a lifetime of being a responsible saver, perhaps denying yourself luxuries in the pursuit of a comfortable retirement, your hard work has paid off. Your pension can provide a more than comfortable investment income. Plus, your calculations (often with the reassurance of a financial adviser) tell you that there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll run out of money. Yet spending still scares you.\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem? It\u2019s not maths, it\u2019s psychology. And it can have a pernicious and damaging effect on the experience of retirement.\n\nFinancial advisers say navigating the change in mindset from saver to spender is a challenge many clients are unprepared for. A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found around age 62, more than half of the sample have incomes higher than expenditure, and this figure increases to about 80 per cent by the end of retirement.\n\n\u201cIt is incredibly common to work with clients who have more than enough wealth to last them their lifetime, if not several, yet most feel at some level that they may still run out of money,\u201d says Katherine Waller, co-founder of wealth manager Six Degrees.\n\nOne problem is the preconditioning that comes through a savings habit lasting 30 to 40 years. Dan Haylett, director of TFP Financial Planning, says: \u201cWe\u2019re spoon fed saving and associate money in the bank with security. But in a modern retirement we need to flick the switch to spending.\u201d\n\nAnother issue is that there are no retirement \u201crole models\u201d to learn from. People retiring now have a very different experience to that of their parents and grandparents. Someone with a defined benefit pension retiring 25 years ago went from a regular income through their work salary to another secure guaranteed (albeit lower) income through the pension scheme. \u201cWe\u2019re now going from income, to no income and a pot of money that we have to deplete intentionally,\u201d says Haylett. \u201cAlso, that\u2019s a pot of money that gives us social status and a feeling of achievement. The sense of loss from spending it is huge in modern day retirement. People struggle with it.\u201d\n\nVicky Reynal is a psychotherapist who focuses on people\u2019s relationship with money. When it is hard to shift from saving to spending, she says it might be because saving was a psychological defence against negative feelings. \u201cChanging our behaviour could leave us feeling too vulnerable or unable to manage the emotions that emerge as we try to spend our hard-earned money,\u201d she says.\n\nMost experts cite childhood as a key influence. It doesn\u2019t matter how old we are, our spending is still influenced hugely by what we\u2019ve observed when growing up. Haylett says: \u201cThere\u2019s no blueprint if you look to parents or grandparents. For them, frugality was a badge of honour.\u201d\n\nIn the worst cases, the emotions preventing spending may be strong feelings of anxiety and fear. \u201cSome people\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. cling anxiously to every penny just in case a catastrophic \u2014 and unrealistic \u2014 series of events could materialise,\u201d says Reynal. \u201cSpending threatens a sense of security and evokes almost primal fears.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, people often overestimate how long they\u2019ll live, says Haylett. \u201cIf you\u2019ve had four aunts live to 101, I get it. But not many people know someone aged 100. I think the idea of a 100-year life is completely ruining people\u2019s retirement.\u201d\n\nIn the UK, people aged 65 can expect to live on average a further 19.7 years for men and 22.0 years for women, according to ONS data. This is projected to rise to 21.9 years for males and 24.1 years for females aged 65 years in 2045.\n\nOne way is to think of money left behind after death as a \u201clost opportunity\u201d. Haylett says: \u201cIf I fast forward 20-30 years and you still have 70 per cent of your net wealth on the table, people say it feels stupid and they have missed out.\u201d The potential for the government to tax it at the end is another incentive to spend and enjoy it now.\n\nBut the balance is difficult to get right, especially since advisers disagree on whether retirement spending should follow a U-shaped path or a straight line.\n\nMany advisers talk about the three phases of a 30-year retirement, roughly divided into 10 years each. First is \u201cgo-go\u201d, when people have lots of energy and may want to explore the world and spend money. Then comes \u201cslow-go\u201d, when spending slows. Finally, they enter the \u201cno-go\u201d, or resting years, when health may be poor. Spending is higher at the start and at the end too, if long-term care is needed.\n\nThe prospect of a large care bill at the end of life is what most people\u2019s anxiety centres around. \u201cPeople usually want a back-up plan in place,\u201d says Waller.\n\nThis is often your housing wealth. But it might also include gifting to family in tiers, holding some gifts back for later in retirement. Or using a gift and loan trust, where you can have access to the capital, but won\u2019t benefit from any investment growth.\n\nAnalysis by Interactive Investor, an investment platform, shows that someone living until age 100 could need an extra \u00a3260,000 pension wealth to give them a comfortable retirement, compared with someone who lives until 83 years old. The average nursing home costs around \u00a361,000 each year, so two years in a care home could cost around \u00a3122,000.\n\nDoug Brodie, founder and chief executive of Chancery Lane Retirement Income Planning, disputes the fact that spending is higher at the start of retirement. While some of his clients plan to spend an extra \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000 a year on holidays in the early years of retirement, he says in every single case he\u2019s found they don\u2019t. He puts this down to lifestyle being fixed by the time they reach retirement. \u201cIf you have all the time on your hands, would you go and spend a week living in a fancy hotel in Paris? Most people say \u2018that\u2019s not the lifestyle that makes me feel comfortable.\u2019 You\u2019ve spent 40 years embedding your lifestyle with kids, family and local relationships.\u201d\n\nMore often than not, Reynal says the feeling evoked around spending is guilt, either over its profligacy or the fact that money spent on themselves will reduce the amount their children inherit. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s the guilt of not having been better parents emotionally,\u201d she says.\n\nAll advisers agree that it\u2019s important to try to identify these unconscious discomforts \u2014 and this can be done in conversation with family or a trusted adviser. \u201cTalking can be emotive but writing it down or seeing it in writing can be different,\u201d says Waller.\n\nMoira O\u2019Neill is a freelance money and investment writer.

Following the Budget in October, this has changed to \u201cspend your pension before Rachel Reeves does.\u201d\n\nInheritance tax will be extended to unspent pension pots from 2027 \u2014 prompting the well-advised wealthy to have a radical rethink of their retirement plans. Whether retirees opt to take money out of pensions and spend it, gift it to the next generation or leave it where it is, it is set to be a \u201cgold mine\u201d for the Treasury, generating \u00a340bn in additional taxes over the next two decades, according to former pensions minister Sir Steve Webb.\n\nThis will be music to the ears of whoever might be chancellor by the year 2030 (I bet it won\u2019t be Reeves) when tax revenues from this change are predicted to accelerate. But could behavioural changes offer a near-term boost for the property market and the consumer economy?\n\nWebb is well placed to calculate the potential upside. Now a partner at consultancy LCP, he has based his estimate on the huge number of final salary pensions that were transferred out of defined benefit schemes between 2015-2020, typically by men in their late 50s working for blue-chip companies.\n\nThe era of ultra-low interest rates ensured high transfer values, tempting over 100,000 retirees to trade the security of an income that would die with them for a more flexible investment pot they could pass to their heirs free of IHT (and in some cases, free of income tax) \u2014 until now.\n\nSpouses and civil partners aside, from 2027 anyone inheriting a pension pot could have to pay IHT and income tax at their highest marginal rate. To avoid this \u201cdouble taxation\u201d, financial advisers and their clients are weighing up the merits of upping pension withdrawals. These would be subject to income tax, but prudent use of gifting allowances (including the so-called \u201cseven year rule\u201d) could lessen IHT liability, or remove it altogether.\n\nGifting property deposits to children or grandchildren will be the first thought for many. Last year, the bank of mum and dad spent \u00a39.2bn supporting 335,000 house purchases in the UK, according to Legal & General, with almost half of buyers under 35 receiving family assistance. If this ratio rises as Reeves tweaks mortgage affordability for first-time buyers, it could boost property prices and stamp duty revenues.\n\nDavid Hearne, a chartered financial planner at FPP, says the measures will reshape the great generational wealth transfer. Many of his clients are now considering making regular pension withdrawals (incurring income tax on the way out) and funding pension contributions for their adult children, who will receive tax relief and employer contributions on the way in.\n\nHe predicts equity release to extract value from the family home will be a popular tool. Money taken that way can be spent or gifted, with debts reducing the value of the estate and lessening the sting of IHT bills.\n\nTo encourage wealthy retirees to spend and enjoy their money, Hearne keeps a big reel of 40-per-cent-off stickers on his desk as a conversation starter. \u201cSpending \u00a320,000 on the trip of a lifetime could be seen as only costing \u00a312,000 as the money won\u2019t be subject to 40 per cent IHT when you die,\u201d he says.\n\nAs advisers and their clients rejig plans, could this pulling forward of spending help to turbo-charge VAT receipts and boost the lacklustre UK economy?\n\nDespite LCP\u2019s punchy predictions, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, has doubts. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge difference for the overall economy\u201d, he says, \u201calthough it could be for individuals or their heirs.\u201d\n\nMuch will come down to timing. If retirees pull more out of pension pots sooner than expected, this will reduce their spending power in later years. And while the wealthiest can spend (or gift) with confidence, the biggest worry for those less affluent is balancing investment risk against longevity risk.\n\nThose in my own circle who netted tidy sums by transferring their defined benefit pension into a Sipp have had a nerve-racking week as DeepSeek roiled global stock markets.\n\nRun down the pension too much, and they risk running out of money in retirement. Plus, they will have given up any spousal benefits in their defined benefit scheme and will need to provide enough for a surviving partner. This, and the lottery of care costs, could be a brake on spending and gifting.\n\nDifficult choices lie ahead. But with more than half of all those retiring between now and 2060 forecast not to be saving anywhere near enough, these are nice problems to have.\n\nClaer Barrett is the FT\u2019s consumer editor and author of the FT\u2019s Sort Your Financial Life Out newsletter series; claer.barrett@ft.com; Instagram and TikTok @ClaerB\n\nclaer.barrett@ft.com", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0093bbce-ea65-4488-9b0c-9f79836ac08e"}, {"uuid4": "057f26f9-3416-4575-b984-1ed3f9ad64f8", "title": "Britain must decide if it is to remain a serious player on defence", "description": "Fiscal constraints put Starmer and Reeves in an unenviable situation, but Trump has changed the terms of the debate", "author": "Camilla Cavendish", "published_date": "2025-01-31T18:00:15.102Z", "content": "Mercurial Donald Trump may be, but he has a gift for shifting the debate. And sometimes, he is right. When it comes to defence spending, the only surprise is how long Europe\u2019s Nato members have managed to freeride on American taxpayers.\n\nEurope is rearming, and not only because of the fear that Trump will call for members to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence at Nato\u2019s June summit. Russia\u2019s nuclear rhetoric, cyber attacks, the sabotage of undersea cables in the Baltic Sea and China\u2019s vast new military command centre demonstrate that, as Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, said last year, \u201cthe world has got rougher\u201d.\n\nRussia\u2019s neighbours have been upping their game for some time. Poland\u2019s military outlay is already 4 per cent of GDP and its armed forces are now the third biggest in Nato. In Sweden, every household recently received a government leaflet, \u201cIn Case of Crisis or War\u201d, advising on emergency evacuation and how to store food if power fails.\n\nIn Britain, the threat still feels remote. The government refuses to say when it will meet its target of raising defence spending from 2.3 per cent to 2.5 per cent, fearing unpopular deep cuts elsewhere.\u00a0But time is not on its side.\n\nThe UK still has a good story to tell. Our special forces, our intelligence services and our nuclear deterrent are a strong card for London in its relationships with Brussels and Washington. We play a leadership role in the Joint Expeditionary Force of northern and eastern European Nato members, we provide nuclear attack submarines to Australia through the Aukus partnership with the US and we are part of the Global Combat Air Partnership to build a next-generation warplane, with Italy and Japan.\n\nWithout commensurate funding, however, these involvements accelerate overstretch. Defence experts repeat the phrase \u201chollowed out\u201d. Britain is relying on shiny totemic kit \u2014 its aircraft carriers and Trident \u2014 to project a level of underlying muscle that it no longer has.\n\nEven the 2.3 per cent is not quite what it seems, since it includes pensions. New \u201chunter killer\u201d submarines have been stuck in port because of a lack of repair docks. General Sir Patrick Sanders, former chief of the general staff, has warned that Britain is no longer capable of launching the kind of operation it did in southern Iraq in 2003. The defence select committee complained a year ago that it could not even adequately judge Britain\u2019s readiness, because the Ministry of Defence is so much more secretive than Nato allies.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is waiting for the strategic defence review in the spring. The reviewers include Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser once described by Trump as \u201ca deep state stiff with a nice accent\u201d (she hails from County Durham). Hill knows better than most that Trump takes a maximalist position. Her memoir quotes the president, in his first term, complaining that advisers who criticised his threats to leave Nato were \u201cruining my leverage\u201d.\n\nBut even if Trump settles for more like 3.5 per cent, the UK is still in a fix. Starmer needs to decide, now, what spending envelope to give the reviewers. Some Labour backbenchers have warned that dithering is a grave mistake. Not all MPs or voters would support cutting transport, say, to fund defence. But few would want to see Britain let down Ukraine, after all we have done.\n\nBritain now faces an existential question: are we going to remain a serious player or be exposed as a Potemkin power, talking a big game while resources dwindle? There is always disagreement behind the scenes on whether we should be fighting \u201cthe last war\u201d or the next one. But the experience in Ukraine suggests winning requires both cutting-edge technology and conventional weapons, not one or the other. And that mass matters: in terms of troops, tanks and artillery. The ceasefire envisaged by Marco Rubio, US secretary of state, is likely to require America\u2019s European allies to help maintain a frozen zone between Ukraine and Russia, perhaps for some time.\n\nThere are always tensions, too, between the different armed services. But without a bigger fiscal envelope, it is unlikely that Britain can continue to be a serious player on both land and sea.\n\nThe fiscal constraints make this a hellish situation for the government. Chancellor Rachel Reeves didn\u2019t mention defence this week in her speech on growth, but it is a core part of the industrial strategy, and rightly so. Although the ministry of defence does not publish a complete analysis of where it sources weaponry, we know that parts of the F-35 fighter jets are being made here. The Typhoon weapons system, according to BAE Systems, has contributed \u00a31.4bn to the UK economy\u00a0in export sales. The industry supports an ecosystem of suppliers which contribute to regeneration.\n\nBehind the scenes, there has been lobbying for both London and Brussels to exempt defence from fiscal rules on national security grounds \u2014 this seems unlikely to appeal to Reeves.\n\nBut there is yet another challenge brewing, from calls to boycott the defence industry. In 2020, the Supreme Court over-ruled the then Conservative government\u2019s attempts to stop the Local Government Pension Scheme divesting from defence, after an action brought by the Palestine Solidarity campaign. A number of local authorities have dumped defence stocks.\n\nSuccessive governments have performed a delicate dance of the veils on defence, trying to maintain prestige while fudging resources. But now the music has stopped. The decision that Reeves and Starmer make in the coming months will have an impact on the UK\u2019s alliances, our perceived position in the world, and our perception of ourselves.\n\ncamilla.cavendish@ft.com", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/74ea2a31-c023-4aa8-a103-e42dae3528d5"}, {"uuid4": "c6b5a7d7-9c86-46f7-9d4f-cc665bf6e0a2", "title": "What\u2019s behind the boom in car parking charge tickets?", "description": "The industry, which has attracted lots of private equity investment, is becoming increasingly punitive", "author": "Alistair Gray", "published_date": "2025-01-31T12:33:46.864Z", "content": "Parking in the UK has become a major annoyance for drivers. There are the fiddly apps, the cashless machines that never seem to work and the ever-increasing rates. Fall foul of the rules and you can expect a parking charge notice to be posted through your door within days.\n\nMotorists have taken to online message boards to rail against what they see as profiteering, alleging unfair fees, confusing signage and heavy-handed enforcement, with many believing the process has become more vindictive in recent years.\n\nDrivers are certainly getting more fines. In the 2023-24 tax year, private car park operators handed out a record near-13mn parking charge notices. In the six months to last October, they were being issued at a rate of one every two seconds.\n\nPrivate parking companies have grown rapidly over the past decade and now manage more than 50,000 sites across the UK, up fivefold from 2012, according to the International Parking Community (IPC), a trade body. Over the same period, penalty ticket issuance has skyrocketed, rising more than eightfold.\n\nOperators say their growth has been commensurate with a rise in demand for parking spaces and an increase in the number of people repeatedly flouting the rules.\n\nWill Hurley, chief executive of the IPC, is keen to point out that most people pay for their parking without incident \u2014 99.77 per cent of \u201cparking events\u201d are \u201cseamless\u201d, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely right that we look to improve,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut unfortunately the sector only gets talked about when something goes wrong.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s a sector that has enjoyed bumper profits recently. Seven of the UK\u2019s top 10 largest private car park operators have brought in record operating profits in the last three years, according to a Financial Times analysis of Companies House filings.\n\nThe industry has also undergone significant change. A wave of takeovers since 2017 has brought most of the biggest players under the ultimate ownership of private equity groups such as Wall Street behemoth KKR.\n\nHurley claims that, across the industry, the money from \u201cpaid-for parking\u201d far exceeds that from \u201cenforcement\u201d. That isn\u2019t true of every car park operator. In its latest accounts, ParkingEye, the fifth-largest operator by revenue, claims it earns most of its turnover \u201cfrom the issue of parking charge notices\u201d. Smart Parking, the UK\u2019s 11th largest car park operator, earned almost 90 per cent of its global revenue last year \u2014 the majority of which originated in the UK \u2014 from issuing penalty tickets, according to its 2024 annual report.\n\nMost of the top 10 did not respond when contacted by the FT. National Car Parks, the largest operator, declined to comment and Q-Park, the second largest, says it operates barriered facilities and does not issue parking tickets. Apcoa says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of its income is \u201cderived from client management fees where we do not take a share from parking/penalty charge notices\u201d. (Creative Car Park, NCP and Q-Park have not achieved record profits in the past three years.)\n\nAlthough often described as parking \u201cfines\u201d, the tickets issued by private companies are technically parking charge notices, invoices that allege a motorist breached the contract to which they implicitly agreed by parking on private land.\n\nOnly local authorities can issue fines, says Scott Dixon, a consumer advocate and founder of The Complaints Resolver blog. Parking charge notices often \u201clook the same [as local authority tickets] and that [means] most motorists see them as fines to pay off as soon as possible,\u201d he explains.\n\nMore than 80 per cent of paid parking charge notices are settled soon after they are issued, according to a submission to parliament by Euro Car Parks. Those who have paid the charges generally aren\u2019t allowed to appeal them subsequently.\n\nParking companies can obtain car owners\u2019 details from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), which sells them on request to approved members of the parking industry\u2019s two trade associations \u2014 the British Parking Association and the IPC. Last year, the DVLA netted at least \u00a331.9mn from the practice. The RAC Foundation, a think-tank, uses the number of vehicle keeper requests made by car park management companies as a proxy for the number of penalty tickets issued \u2014 and FT Money has done the same.\n\nSo how did we get here? Many consider the original sin to be the ban on vehicle clamping on private land, introduced by the government in 2012.\n\nAccording to Hurley, the lack of deterrent resulted in many more people breaking the rules. Others disagree.\n\nSteve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, says: \u201cWhat no one foresaw [in 2012] was the scale at which parking firms would subsequently go after registered keepers. A big part of the issue is that cheap camera technology and ready access to DVLA data means pursuing car owners to \u2018enforce\u2019 parking offences is less expensive than driving around to apply wheel clamps used to be.\u201d\n\nThere have been numerous calls for reform. In 2022, the government attempted to regulate the industry and impose a \u00a350 cap on most charges. That year, car park operators launched multiple legal challenges, leading the government to withdraw its proposals.\n\nLast October, the industry set up its own code of conduct and in January 2025 formed a new panel \u2014 that it claims is independent \u2014 to oversee it.\n\nHurley, whose IPC organisation was not involved in 2022\u2019s legal challenges, says: \u201cWhat I want to achieve is for people to read the signage, follow the signage and then avoid a parking charge, because ultimately it\u2019s really easy not to get a parking charge if you\u2019re told how to avoid it.\u201d\n\nThe first item on the new panel\u2019s agenda was to stop motorists being penalised for taking more than five minutes to pay for parking.\n\nIn December, Excel Parking dropped its court claim against Rosey Hudson, a 31-year old from Leicestershire, whom it had charged nearly \u00a32,000 in accumulated penalty tickets. Her case, disputed by Excel, was that she was delayed in paying for her parking on multiple occasions due to a poor mobile phone signal when trying to use the car park\u2019s app.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2024, Excel Parking tripled its operating profits to \u00a35.1mn and last year its operating margin stood at 28 per cent, the highest level since it started filing public accounts. Owner and founder Simon Renshaw-Smith was paid a dividend of \u00a3522,000 last year on top of at least \u00a3150,000 for his role as a director. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExcel has nearly halved its headcount since 2017 and slashed its wage bill by over a third, according to its 2024 annual report.\n\n\u201cWe need parking to support our high streets, towns and city centres, but something is clearly going wrong,\u201d says Catherine Atkinson, the Labour MP for Derby North, who has raised the issue of unfair parking charges in parliament.\n\nShe says that many of her constituents paid for parking but had received parking charge notices for exceeding grace periods allowed by car park operators. \u201cFor a lot of people, it\u2019s been because they\u2019ve been older or assisting others, or they\u2019ve really struggled with [parking payment] apps and broken machines.\u201d\n\nAtkinson called for \u201can independently set code of practice\u201d and says she will broach the subject with parking executives at a roundtable in February.\n\nBack when the government tried to set new rules for the sector, parking companies made the argument that a full impact assessment had not been carried out. A survey by audit firm Mazars on behalf of the BPA argued that the government\u2019s fee caps would bankrupt almost half of private car park operators affiliated with the trade body within a year.\n\nSpeaking to MPs in 2021, Philip Boynes, chief executive of ParkingEye, said the drop in revenues resulting from the changes would be \u201cunsustainable\u201d without significant cost-cutting and job losses.\n\nBoynes told the MPs that the \u201caverage profit of a car parking operator was about 2.1 per cent\u201d, citing a report by IbisWorld.\n\nThe FT\u2019s analysis shows that ParkingEye\u2019s operating margin that year was 15 per cent, up from 5 per cent in 2020. From 2015 onwards, aside from the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, the company\u2019s margins have remained above 20 per cent.\n\nBoynes did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nParkingEye issued roughly one in five of all UK parking charge notices last year. It is owned by the world\u2019s largest infrastructure investor, Macquarie, which previously owned distressed utility provider Thames Water. ParkingEye manages car parks for clients ranging from McDonald\u2019s to the NHS.\n\nIn 2023 the company made an operating profit of \u00a315.5mn from revenues of \u00a357.5mn \u2014 a margin of 27 per cent.\n\nParkingEye says it \u201coperates responsibly and fairly\u201d. The company adds its growth has \u201cbeen in response to the increase in demand [from] landowners who wish to ensure an increasing motorist population can access [facilities] that might otherwise become congested by non-compliant motorists who misuse the parking facilities\u201d.\n\nThe industry\u2019s own code of conduct, which came into effect last year, was largely similar to the government\u2019s original, but omitted the proposed \u00a350 cap on parking charge notices and restrictions on debt recovery fees.\n\nAt the time, the RAC Foundation said the industry\u2019s code \u201cconveniently avoided some of the biggest issues [that] badly need[ed] to be addressed to prevent drivers being taken advantage of.\u201d\n\nSir Greg Knight, the former Conservative MP who introduced legislation to regulate the sector, is urging the new government to \u201ctake up the gauntlet\u201d and introduce a \u201cnational parking code\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe present situation is highly unsatisfactory; parking companies are in effect policing their own rules,\u201d he says. \u201cThe threat of legal action was unfortunate, but the government appears to have let this matter drift.\u201d\n\nThe government says it is \u201cdetermined\u201d to protect motorists and \u201cdrive up standards in the industry\u201d. It adds that it will \u201cset out further details on the private parking code of practice as soon as possible\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn my book, this is unfinished business,\u201d says Knight.\n\nAdditional reporting by Alistair Gray.

On the North Downs Way, just outside Sevenoaks and 20 miles from the centre of London, a dog-walker pauses and steps to one side of the narrow, muddy path to make space for a group of young people coming the other way. But a strange thing happens. As the man and the dog wait, the people just keep coming \u2014 two or three abreast, all seemingly in their 20s, smiling and chatting animatedly as they pour out of the woods along the path, a gregarious Gen-Z column almost 400-people strong.\n\nThough he didn\u2019t know it, the man was witnessing the latest outing of Overground, one of a new breed of walking groups that is taking an activity previously associated with sedate middle-age and reinventing it for a Gen-Z and millennial audience. Information is shared on TikTok and Instagram, and the groups often meet in the Home Counties or within a short train ride of other major cities.\n\nFor many of the organisers, it\u2019s about building community, harnessing the mental-health benefits of spending time in nature, encouraging participation from under-represented groups and getting away from hectic city lives. And for an increasingly sober demographic, the early starts on weekend mornings are no problem.\n\nBefore starting their hiking group Dykes Who Hike in March 2024, neither Lucy Cooper nor Yas Message had been big hikers. \u201cWe wanted to see more of the countryside whilst making new connections. . . without relying on alcohol,\u201d says Cooper.\n\nWhen the pair advertised their first hike on social media, the \u201cSeven Sisters walk\u201d from Seaford to Eastbourne, 60 people turned up. When 250 turned up for their second, they realised they might need to formalise a ticketing system to avoid hikes becoming \u201ctoo intimidating for people to enjoy\u201d. Tickets now cost \u00a32, and all 200 spaces typically sell out in minutes; in the past year, new branches have sprouted in Manchester, Leeds, Shropshire and Birmingham.\n\nLast weekend I joined another new group, the Adventure Girls Club, meeting up with 12 women and two dogs at Bath station for a foray into the Downs. \u201cThe [traditional] hiking community can often focus on hiking the farthest, fastest or the most challenging route,\u201d says the group\u2019s founder Alice Keegan, \u201cwhereas I love to hike slowly, take in the views, notice the nature around me \u2014 a more mindful approach.\u201d\n\nKeegan, a qualified mountain leader, used to live in London\u2019s bustling Bethnal Green and work as creative director of a design agency catering to the music industry. Feeling burnt out, she took herself solo hiking in the Lake District and began to appreciate how beneficial the outdoors was for her mental health. Now she wants to support others to \u201cescape the stress of modern living\u201d.\n\nWe file out of town and wind up steep woodland footpaths towards Sham Castle, built in 1762 for Ralph Allen, one of the key figures in Bath\u2019s Georgian revival. As we meander through Smallcombe Wood, Keegan points out species of fungi including the frills of a turkey tail, and the black bulbs of King Alfred\u2019s cakes.\n\nBut if connecting with nature is a key obsession, it is the digital world that is enabling these new communities. Lauren La Faci, TikTok\u2019s London-based consumer communications lead, says that \u201cin recent months, hiking enthusiasts have been captivating millions with stunning landscapes and hiking tutorials\u201d. On the platform, #hiking has 5mn posts (and #hiketok has 270,000). In comparison, #swimming manages 2.1mn posts.\n\nFor Jeb Jagne, who founded Overground in July 2023, \u201cwalking became a way of taking a breather and a way to decompress\u201d after suffering a bereavement, relationship breakup and job loss within the course of a few months. Overground hosts monthly walks within an hour\u2019s train journey of the capital. On their first, 43 people showed up; now there can be as many as 500.\n\nThe walks are free and non-ticketed which means the organisers can\u2019t limit numbers. \u201cThere are already so many barriers when it comes to finding space in the outdoors, I wouldn\u2019t want to introduce another one,\u201d says Jagne. Overground is now fundraising to set up a training programme for people from marginalised groups to become mountain guides.\n\nJagne, who previously worked as a DJ and nightclub promoter, has been sober for the past year. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people meet at Overground and form solid friendships, move into new homes and even go on holiday together. The walks will always be our North Star but what really matters is being that first domino in forming a new connection.\u201d\n\nBack in Bath, 13km trodden and legs aching, the Adventure Girls Club troops back to the train station. The group splits, exchanging social-media contacts and \u201cnice to meet you\u2019s\u201d, returning to suburbia with new friendships forged \u2014 if a little muddier than four hours earlier.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/57e944be-a071-437f-8785-80b8d8c8ee3c"}, {"uuid4": "19a16195-7f6f-4c37-bb2a-80ca5d02b5b5", "title": "New donations to FT charity appeal to be match-funded after deadline extended", "description": "Rosetrees Trust will match gifts to help reach new \u00a3200,000 target", "author": "Patrick Jenkins", "published_date": "2025-01-30T13:15:51.365Z", "content": "Thanks to your generosity, the FT\u2019s joint seasonal appeal in aid of Financial Literacy and Inclusion Campaign \u201cFLIC\u201d and school food charity Magic Breakfast has now reached its baseline target of raising \u00a3100,000.\n\nThe appeal, which was launched in early December, was due to close at the end of this week. But we are now extending the deadline by a week, until Friday February 7, thanks to a late intervention from the Rosetrees Trust, which has generously offered to match-fund donations to get us to a new \u00a3200,000 target.\n\nThe offer is only valuable if readers donate.

We are also supporting research that is looking at the mental health problems of young people, which [is] growing for a variety of reasons.\u201d Financial stress, often compounded by gaps in foundational financial understanding, is a proven contributor to mental health problems.\n\nRoss, whose charity is a leading backer of \u201cventure philanthropy\u201d in the area of medical research, is convinced of the related relevance of the FT\u2019s appeal and is a passionate advocate for a broader push to increase philanthropy. \u201cPeople who are well provided [for] financially should contribute to the needs of others,\u201d he said.\n\nRoss\u2019s family fortune stems from his parents\u2019 multiple business start-ups, which range from a market stall to a property investment empire. That wealth once topped \u00a3100mn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, but Ross has since given away a large portion of it. Medical research grants of more than \u00a350mn have generated follow-on funding of \u00a31.2bn, Ross said.\n\nThe trust\u2019s match-funding offer to FLIC and Magic Breakfast was conditional on the appeal first reaching its original baseline target of \u00a3100,000.

But London-based Andy, 79, is not one of them. He and his wife do not plan to leave their four adult children an inheritance. Instead, the couple have spent what\u2019s left of their funds, sailing and travelling the world before they \u201cpop their clogs\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about equality of opportunity and fairness. It seems unfair that some kids get huge assistance while others get nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re arranging our finances so they have just enough to bury us.\u201d\n\nAndy, who asked us not to use his surname, worked in public education and retired in his early 50s. He says he\u2019s politically \u201cleftwing-ish\u201d, but his views aren\u2019t just about politics \u2014 it\u2019s also a question of parenting.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a helicopter parent\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I hate when I see kids who are 40 and their parents are still looking after them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a noteworthy stance, given the monumental wealth transfer that\u2019s expected globally over the next few decades. A record \u00a35.5tn in wealth is due to be transferred to the next generation in the UK alone. With over 90 per cent of the country\u2019s wealth currently held by Generations X and older, many Boomers and millennials are set to become \u201cinheritance millionaires\u201d.\n\nYet Andy is not entirely alone. In the US, a 2015 survey by HSBC found that one in four Americans planned to spend their money rather than pass it down, a phenomenon known as SKIs \u2014 \u201cspending the kids\u2019 inheritance\u201d. A Hargreaves Lansdown survey in 2021 found around 11 per cent of parents in England choose not to leave an inheritance to their families.\u00a0(In Scotland, there are \u201cforced heirship\u201d rules.)\n\nTheir motivations range from hedonism (wanting to spend the money themselves), not wanting to spoil their children, or philanthropy. Others \u2014 such as actor Daniel Craig \u2014 say they simply find the concept of an inheritance \u201cdistasteful\u201d.\n\nI should mention here that my own parents also belong to this contrarian group. Since as early as I can remember, I\u2019ve known they don\u2019t believe in leaving a large inheritance \u2014 something my dad has spoken publicly about himself. They have instead pledged the overwhelming majority of their wealth to their charity, The Safer Roads Foundation, along with other humanitarian causes.\n\nThe Bank of Mum of Dad has taken excellent care of my sibling and me (including generously paying off our student loans, and allocating funds for a future deposit on a flat \u2014 both immense gifts, and more than many will receive in inheritance). So now, it\u2019s pretty much closed for business.\n\nTo be clear, they haven\u2019t cut us out in anger. Nor are they Marxists \u2014 politically they\u2019re pretty centrist. They simply feel that there are life-saving causes that will benefit from their money more than their two well-educated adult children.\n\nRenaissance philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli once wrote that \u201cA son can bear the loss of his father\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. but the loss of his inheritance may drive him to despair.\u201d For anyone wondering if I\u2019ve succumbed to despondency, fear not: I\u2019m genuinely proud of my parents\u2019 legacy. I feel incredibly fortunate for the support I\u2019ve had during their lifetime. There\u2019s a silver lining too, in that I won\u2019t be at risk of any familial angst once they die (40\u00a0per cent of people report conflict over inheritances).\n\nIf anything, I\u2019m intrigued as to why it\u2019s so provocative, especially among their peers. On the rare occasions that it\u2019s come up, I\u2019ve encountered shock or thinly veiled criticism of my parents. Sometimes I\u2019m met with reassurance that I am in fact in their will and this is a motivational ploy (I checked. If it is a bluff, they\u2019re not breaking the act yet).\n\nAndy also says his friends have been critical of his stance. That\u2019s despite all his children \u201clanding on their feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are horrified,\u201d he says. \u201cThat includes my well-balanced friends\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009They can\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nOnline forums froth with furious commentators wondering how people can \u201cwatch their kids living in a \u2018hole\u2019 while they go and enjoy their cruises.\u201d Anonymous op-eds voice dismay over parents \u201cselfishly\u201d spending their inheritance. There is near delirium each time a member of the super-rich \u2014 including Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg \u2014 publicly vows not to leave their wealth to their offspring. Sure, there\u2019s being charitable, they say, but to such extremes?\n\nFundamentally, wanting to shrink your children\u2019s inheritance is seen as counter to the primitive desire to protect one\u2019s offspring \u2014 no matter how well off they are. The majority of people are dedicated to hoarding for their family, with more than \u00a3100bn inherited and gifted in the UK alone each year, according to Demos, a think-tank.\n\n\u201cTaking care of the kids is the cultural norm. So it\u2019s countercultural if you will,\u201d says psychology professor Janet Reibstein and author of Good Relations. \u201cIt\u2019s seen as neglecting the natural role of parent and child.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a luxury itself to contemplate trimming your will, given many families are scared they won\u2019t get a choice amid rising social costs. Fewer than 30 per cent of Brits expect to benefit \u2014 or have benefited from \u2014 an inheritance, according to a 2022 YouGov poll. The ONS reported that the median inheritance for those who received one was \u00a311,000 (this excludes lifetime gifts), and on average occurs in one\u2019s 60s.\n\nIndeed, political interventions that limit the wealth that\u2019s passed down tend to\u00a0spark controversy, including recent reforms to UK inheritance tax (IHT), often described as \u201cBritain\u2019s most hated tax\u201d. Today, around 4 per cent\u00a0of estates are affected by IHT \u2014\u00a0charged at 40 per cent\u00a0on any part of an estate worth over \u00a3325,000 (or over \u00a31mn\u00a0when a main residence is passed down to children and reliefs are pooled with a spouse). The decision to include pension wealth within the scope of IHT from 2027 has come under fire from some corners of the media, while ending the exemption of agricultural property from IHT caused farmers to march on Downing Street.\n\nInheritance naysayers have a simple argument: lots of money isn\u2019t always the best thing for us. It can damage people \u2014 and wealthy kids need specific guardrails, a theory exposed by the Carnegie Conjecture, which holds that people receiving a substantial inheritance are much more likely to leave the workforce. The party line is that guardrails are crucial, whether parents are handing over life-changing amounts or just a generous leftover that might ease their children\u2019s paths.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s tough love.\n\nJoe Reilly, an adviser to US family offices and host of The Inheritance Podcast, says too much money is a real concern.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a source of anxiety for parents, knowing their children are growing up in affluence\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It can impede their search for internal meaning,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cWealth doesn\u2019t have to deprive motivation, but getting rid of all the challenges does.\u201d\n\nSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says hyper-successful entrepreneurs in particular want their children to make their own way (though this is softened with substantial gifts during their parents\u2019 lifetime).\n\nPart of the issue, according to Reilly, is that inheritance was historically reserved for the aristocratic class, who would reserve \u201ca lot of time and effort\u201d learning to adapt to a big wealth influx, including focusing on public service \u2014 though many still squandered it. Today, inheritance comes to broad swaths of the middle class, who have little or no training.\n\nReceiving a hefty inheritance can come with real baggage, says author Eliza Filby. In her book, Inheritocracy she cites several examples of people who inherited large sums who felt guilt, and a loss of meaning. There\u2019s a danger of \u201ceconomically infantilising\u201d your offspring too, she says, especially in light of the \u201cnepo baby\u201d debate.\n\nTo counter this, family office adviser Elena Nu\u00f1ez Cooper works with clients to adopt a policy of \u201csevere responsibility\u201d with their children. This includes teaching them tough financial lessons from a young age and training them to be philanthropists. It also means managing rich people\u2019s funds so they \u201cdie with zero\u201d, with the majority allocated to a charitable foundation \u2014 ideally led by their conscientious, financially savvy children.\n\n\u201cKids do not benefit from an attitude of \u2018you\u2019re going to inherit later\u2019,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez says. \u201cI work with the children of billionaires who have everything, and they\u2019re a lot worse off in the long run.\u201d\n\nFor parents it can be a big ideological step to consider trimming their children\u2019s or grandchildren\u2019s inheritance instead of boosting it \u2014 even if they are well set up.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps an even tougher pill to swallow for the offspring expecting to receive a chunky inheritance, says financial psychotherapist Vicky Reynal. \u201cWe all have a normal amount of greed,\u201d she says. \u201cMost people want to be wealthier.\u201d\n\nThe framing around cuts in inheritance is therefore key. This includes \u201chighlighting that it has nothing to do with not loving or caring about them,\u201d Reynal notes. Their responses may vary depending on the individual\u2019s maturity and how early on these expectations are set.\n\nProfessor Reibstein goes further. She says that families where there\u2019s little philanthropic precedent will need to work hard to rewrite their \u201cculture\u201d if they want to take this route \u2014 otherwise, \u201cyour children will feel it as a blow.\u201d\n\nHargreaves Lansdown analyst Cooper stresses that it doesn\u2019t have to be all or nothing. Simply, leaving your kids everything doesn\u2019t have to be the default.\n\n\u201cYou can think about giving them comfort without spoiling them,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of adding to their quality of life versus taking away the impetus to work.\u201d\n\nWhatever route you choose, however, experts agree: communicate your wishes early. Emotionally, being disinherited without being told can be devastating. But the other danger, Cooper says, is people can be in for a financial shock when an expected inheritance doesn\u2019t materialise.\n\n\u201cYou absolutely cannot rely on an inheritance,\u201d she warns.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to escape the fact that for many an inheritance can make an outsized difference, especially in light of rising house prices \u2014 the average first-time buyer deposit in London is now over \u00a3140,000, according to Zoopla \u2014 and diminished pensions. That includes segments of the middle class, many of whom are poorer than their parents. Inheritance is bridging that intergenerational gap, says Filby.\n\n\u201cWhether or not you\u2019re from a wealthy family\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[inheritance] is more important in determining your lifetime income than it has been in the past,\u201d says David Sturrock at the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nThe IFS forecasts inheritance will make up a record average 14 per cent of lifetime earnings for the 1980s-born generation. That means for some families, an inheritance will dictate whether they own a house, clear their debts, or can retire comfortably, Sturrock explains. In rare cases, it could be a pathway to social mobility.\n\nYet few born into the top quartile can make that argument. Statistically, most adult children in this camp will enter their 40s with a decent income and firmly on the housing ladder \u2014 often funded by historic parental gifts. A bulky inheritance in this group\u2019s case has been described as insurance against calamity, or laziness.\n\nFor Andy, this is precisely the problem.\n\nHis advice is to think about inheritance as a sporting analogy. Imagine, he says, if there was a rule in F1 whereby if you won the first race, you\u2019d do five fewer laps in the next race.

The sector is reliant on overseas students who typically pay two or three times domestic rates.\n\nOfficial data shows a more than 50 per cent drop in new EU students after Brexit, while universities increased recruitment from other markets in Asia and Africa, including India, Nigeria and Pakistan.\n\nBoris Johnson promised in 2020 that his Brexit deal would not interrupt the \u201cva-et-vient\u201d of people-to-people contacts with the EU, but in practice the intake of UK universities has shifted substantially.\n\nJamie Arrowsmith, director of Universities UK International, which represents the industry, said the changes had brought greater diversity to British campuses, but had narrowed the field of subjects studied as international students tended to favour science and business studies courses.\n\n\u201cWhile the diversity in terms of country of origin has changed, diversity in courses has been lost,\u201d he added.\n\nBrexit also saw the introduction of a points-based immigration system by Johnson\u2019s government from January 1 2021 that coincided with a massive expansion of the NHS workforce, necessitating far more overseas recruitment.\n\nMark Dayan, policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said that a government decision to lower thresholds for medical workers had led to a radical reshaping of the NHS workforce.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2023 the number of ethnic minority doctors in the NHS grew at almost 8 times the rate of white doctors, according to the General Medical Council, with arrivals from India, Pakistan, Egypt, Nigeria and the Philippines rising sharply.\n\nDayan said the challenge of integrating doctors who trained overseas into the NHS was one reason why an increase in staff numbers in recent years had not delivered a commensurate increase in productivity.\n\n\u201cAbsorbing so many new staff, many at [the] start of their careers, who are used to a different system of working, requires a lot of work on training, and introducing them to how things are done in the NHS,\u201d Dayan said.\n\nThe government is planning to train more UK doctors as well as continuing to recruit from abroad, but its red lines on free movement of workers mean that it is unlikely that EU-UK reset negotiations will see a significant increase in recruitment from the EU.\n\nBrexit was sold during the 2016 referendum campaign as the means by which the UK would \u201ctake back control\u201d of its borders, curbing both legal and illegal migration.\n\nIn the event, both surged after 2020, fuelling accusations of betrayal on the political right and helping to drive support for Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK party, which has recently drawn level with both Labour and the Conservatives in the polls.\n\nThis political splintering is the opposite of what former Tory premier David Cameron intended when he called the referendum to head off the threat posed by Farage\u2019s UK Independence Party and resolve long-standing divisions over Europe inside the Conservative party.\n\nBut Reform\u2019s rise has come despite a decline in the overall popularity of Brexit, with 58 per cent of voters now saying Brexit was the wrong decision, according to polling by the National Centre for Social Research.\n\nA \u201ckey element\u201d of this shift, according to pollster Sir John Curtice, is driven by demographic trends as older, pro-Brexit voters die off and younger voters, who were unable to vote in 2016, express their overwhelming pro-EU views.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the demographics story, the ceiling for a Farage party should be lower than 10 years ago, but Reform is more popular in 2024 than Ukip was in 2014,\u201d said Rob Ford, professor of politics at Manchester University.\n\nFord credited this counter-intuitive outcome to the platform Brexit gave Farage, and to the political opportunity offered to him by the Tories\u2019 struggle to deliver benefits from the UK\u2019s break with the EU.\n\nThe past few years have laid bare Brexit\u2019s damaging impact on business. Countries usually strike trade deals to reduce border bureaucracy, but the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement did the reverse, restoring the customs requirements that had disappeared with the advent of the EU single market.\n\nLabour has said it will not rejoin a customs union with the EU or go back into the EU single market, so trade will continue to face customs barriers.\n\nStarmer\u2019s negotiations with the EU could reduce friction for some individual sectors, such as food and drink exporters, if Labour makes good on its promise to strike a veterinary agreement with Brussels.\n\nAligning industrial standards and relinking the EU and UK carbon trading schemes could also reduce other forms of red tape, such as licensing requirements and carbon border adjustment taxes, or CBAMs.\n\nHowever a mountain of paperwork will remain. In 2023, the last year for which data is available, there were more than 41mn customs declarations for trade between the UK and the EU. The much criticised Brussels red tape became \u2018red white and blue\u2019 tape.\n\nAs a result, UK goods exports underperformed other rich-world countries, with the total value rising by just 0.3 per cent per year, compared with 4.2 per cent annually across the OECD, according to the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank.\n\nNew Brexit red tape has hit small businesses hardest, with research by the London School of Economics calculating that 16,400 firms stopped exporting to the EU after the TCA came into force.\n\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce said smaller companies had less capacity to deal with \u201cthe deluge\u201d of new bureaucracy, while larger businesses had the money and staff to adapt.\n\n\u201cExporting to the EU was often a gateway for SMEs to enter new export markets across the world, so the urgency of making border processes cheaper and simpler is clear,\u201d he added.\n\nThe BCC has urged the government to use the reset negotiations to simplify border processes and promote regulatory co-operation on customs matters, particularly as the bloc introduces new rules in the coming years.\n\nChris Southworth, secretary-general of the International Chamber of Commerce, said that given the UK\u2019s red lines the government should invest in digitising trade, using AI and improving access to trade finance in order to help business.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need TCA for any of this and it will improve EU co-operation and repair some of the damage,\u201d he added.\n\nPoll tracker by Jonathan Vincent", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4d2d78b0-eedd-485c-9a9c-4e41baf46146"}, {"uuid4": "ec615be7-859d-4a2b-9544-5609255c4807", "title": "AstraZeneca ditches plan to build \u00a3450mn UK vaccine plant", "description": "Decision is a blow to Starmer\u2019s government after setting out pro-growth pitch to investors ", "author": "Hannah Kuchler", "published_date": "2025-01-31T16:23:59.576Z", "content": "AstraZeneca has cancelled plans for a \u00a3450mn UK vaccine manufacturing plant after months of wrangling with British officials about state support for the project, in a major blow to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s government.\n\nUK officials put forward a revised offer of financial support for the site close to Liverpool this month that was significantly higher than the \u00a340mn offered last year, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nStarmer\u2019s Labour government had initially sought last summer to reduce the amount of public money provided to the project in Speke from about \u00a390mn to \u00a340mn.\n\n\u201cFollowing protracted discussions with the government, we are no longer pursuing our planned investment at Speke,\u201d AstraZeneca said in a statement on Friday.\n\n\u201cSeveral factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government\u2019s proposal.\u201d\n\nThe new plant was going to make the next generation of flu vaccines and help the UK be more resilient in future pandemics.\n\nThe existing Speke site will continue to produce and supply a flu vaccine, said AstraZeneca, the largest UK-listed company by market capitalisation.\n\nThe decision comes just days after chancellor Rachel Reeves sought to position the UK as a highly attractive place for life science companies to invest in a major speech on growth.\n\nStarmer and Reeves have faced criticism from business for their \u00a340bn tax-raising Budget last year and other measures including stronger worker rights, which executives have warned will make the UK a less attractive place to invest.\n\nThe UK\u2019s previous offer to the pharmaceutical group under former Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt included up to \u00a370mn in grants to develop an existing AstraZeneca vaccine facility at Speke, as well as \u00a320mn in research and development support from the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nHunt, who announced the deal to great fanfare in March of last year, told the Financial Times that AstraZeneca\u2019s decision was a \u201cmassive own goal by the government\u201d.\n\n\u201cManufacturing high-end vaccines is a huge opportunity for us to move away from over-dependence on the R&D part of the value chain,\u201d he said. \u201cI intervened personally to get this deal over the line in 2023 and am mortified the government has dropped the ball on it.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury said: \u201cA change in the make-up of the investment originally proposed by AstraZeneca led to a reduced government grant offer being put forward.

The US index\u2019s tech share rises to 45 per cent if stocks such as Amazon and Alphabet \u2014 categorised by the French bank as consumer and communications companies respectively \u2014 are included.\n\nIn addition, Trump\u2019s softer stance on tariffs \u2014 the White House has said the US will go ahead with 25 per cent duties on goods from Mexico and Canada and 10 per cent on goods from China, although as yet it has failed to hit the euro area with levies \u2014 has come as a relief to investors.\n\n\u201cExpectations for Europe were on the floor,\u201d said Sharon Bell, a senior equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. \u201cThis has changed.\u201d\n\nAfter years of underperforming Wall Street, European shares are also trading near their widest valuation discount to the US since at least the late 1980s, according to data from SocGen. The UK market in particular has benefited from low valuations, say analysts.\n\n\u201cI have been quite surprised by the increased interest in UK equities, it is probably because the growth expectations are pretty high compared to the rest of Europe,\u201d Bell said.\n\n\u201cAnd obviously it is cheap. It could also be seen as a hedge against tech\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009for diversification.\u201d\n\nThe strong performance of European stocks comes even as the Eurozone struggles to recover from a sharp rise in energy and food prices triggered by Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while the US economy continues to grow strongly.\u00a0Data this week showed the Eurozone economy unexpectedly stagnated in the fourth quarter.\n\nHowever, the prospect of further interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank may cheer investors, analysts said. In the US, markets believe inflationary pressures will force the US central bank to keep rates higher for longer.\n\n\u201cIf the market starts to freak about inflation in the US that will also be more positive for European equities in comparison,\u201d said SocGen\u2019s Kaloyan.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ray Douglas", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5dce2ba6-9bac-4dc2-a611-3586b26e5d1f"}, {"uuid4": "d759faa0-234a-4d64-b4a0-5893cc0e542b", "title": "Ofsted to press ahead with \u2018Nando\u2019s-style\u2019 scorecard for schools", "description": "Proposed assessment of 8 core areas would replace regulator\u2019s controversial single-word judgments", "author": "Anna Gross", "published_date": "2025-01-31T16:05:29.362Z", "content": "Education regulator Ofsted is pressing ahead with plans for a colour-coded scorecard to assess school performance across eight core areas that critics have compared to a Nando\u2019s spice chart.\n\nSir Martyn Oliver, chief inspector of Ofsted, will launch a consultation on a new system for assessing schools in England in which single-word judgments would be replaced with one- or two-word judgments across eight main areas, according to an internal presentation seen by the Financial Times on Thursday.\n\nThe system would replace the old process where schools were given an overall judgment ranging from \u201coutstanding\u201d to \u201cinadequate\u201d, which teachers have long complained was overly simplistic, often unrepresentative and extremely difficult to appeal against.\n\nThe eight core assessment areas that schools will be judged against are achievement, leadership and governance, curriculum, developing teaching, personal development and wellbeing, attendance, behaviour and attitudes, and inclusion.\n\nThe assessment areas of \u201cpreparation for next steps\u201d and \u201copportunities to thrive\u201d have been dropped since a previous iteration of the scorecard was circulated to stakeholders in November.\n\nThe consultation is expected to be launched next week, according to a senior figure in the school sector.\n\nOfsted did not comment.\n\nThe proposals to colour-code the performance designations have faced strong pushback from senior figures in the teaching sector, with some comparing it to the spice-ranking system used by fast-food restaurant Nando\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still Nando\u2019s.

Sadly there is clear evidence to support his case \u2014 from attempts to monitor \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d to shocking attempts to suppress the views of gender critical academics such as Kathleen Stock and Jo Phoenix.\n\nGoodwin is angry about hostility he himself has encountered because of his support for the populist right and has made a journey from university academic (until last year he was professor of politics at the University of Kent) to political activist. But his anger gets in the way of analysing the convergence on the university system of a range of very different forces.\n\nFirst is the intellectual climate, itself shaped by universities. They are where critical theory began and flourished. It is a theory which appeals to academics because it says that words matter: language is a tool of oppression. So our language and the curriculum have to be decolonised in order truly to deliver diversity, equity and inclusion. It is an agenda far removed from classic concerns of the left such as what people earn and what access they have to public services. And there is another crucial difference. There were always left-wing academics \u2014 as well as some of a more conservative disposition. But the university as an institution was not engaged in their arguments and did not take a view. Now there are universities, especially but not only in America, where advocates of critical theory have recruited university administrators who use university-wide EDI programmes to advance their agenda and try to require academics to comply.\n\nSecondly there is the intense transgender debate, exacerbated in the UK by misinterpretation of the Equality Act. Too many universities, perhaps influenced by the LGBTQ+ rights charity Stonewall, interpreted the Act to mean any form of self-identified gender is a protected characteristic. The Reindorf review of problems at the University of Essex is a clear and authoritative account of serious mistreatment of academics as a result. Since it was published in 2021 no British university should repeat such behaviour.\n\nThe third trend is how students are changing. The psychologists Jean Twenge and Jonathan Haidt have persuasively argued that the rise in access to social media is leading to mental health issues for young people. This can lead to the introduction of trigger warnings and a belief that freedom of speech is less important than protecting people\u2019s feelings. However, higher education appears to provide some resilience to these pressures, lowering the risk of young people withdrawing from work because of mental illness.\n\nThere is a class divide too. Young white working-class men are even less likely to go to university than many ethnic minority groups. We should encourage more to go. The real luxury belief is advantaged graduates saying there is no point going to university when for many young people from disadvantaged backgrounds it is the most powerful tool of social mobility we\u2019ve got. For those who were previously on free school meals, average graduate earnings growth in their first decade is 75 per cent, while for non-graduates it is 26 per cent. But instead of promoting the value of higher education, social mobility advocates have put more weight, probably excessive, on the early years.\n\nThere has also been the shift in attitudes away from globalisation, represented by Trump and Brexit. David Goodhart, cited by Goodwin, makes universities the arch-culprits in his moral divide between citizens of Somewhere or Nowhere. This is particularly hard on universities as most of them have places in their names. They are definitely somewhere and a good thing too. They are very likely to stay rooted in their place even if the big employers move out or the local paper closes down. Towns and cities in the UK such as Chester, Coventry, Worcester or Bournemouth have been revitalised by the emergence of a strong local university. The government may be underestimating the shockwaves if a university closes.\n\nAdd to this mix empowering the student as consumer. The student is not just a consumer, though the university fee is a contract to deliver a service and that strengthens the student voice. Most local student unions don\u2019t want Marxist revolution but to get their academic work back promptly and seminars that are less crowded. But student satisfaction rankings have been given exaggerated weight and empowered students to threaten academics on very different issues.\n\nThere are university leaders who see that all these forces mean they have heavy new responsibilities which they cannot avoid. Universities should be the place where diverse young people learn how to disagree. The 2015 Chicago Statement of the principles of free speech in university is important and Goodwin wants \u201cto force universities, through government action, to sign up\u201d and then to practise what they preach.\n\nHis many anecdotes move between UK and US as if our two university systems are interchangeable. But there are important differences such as greater labour market protections in the UK (and even more in Europe). Protection from unfair dismissal matters if an academic is caught in a social media frenzy. This might explain the paradox that American and to some extent British universities have been far more susceptible to some of these forces than Continental Europe despite their intellectual origins in Continental postmodernist philosophy.\n\nGoodwin wants to use \u201cthe powers of the state to restore justice and balance\u201d. The loss of confidence in the ability of universities to protect freedom of speech justified the 2023 freedom of speech legislation with new powers for the university regulator, which I support. But this is tricky territory.\n\nThe problems began on the morning the previous Conservative government launched the initiative. On the Today programme the minister responsible was asked if this meant Holocaust denial would be protected, and she said yes. Holocaust denial is not itself a legal offence in the UK so her statement made sense for a proper free speech absolutist.

It was enough space to create a jewel-box garden studded with clipped yew and beech topiary, exquisite borders, an ornamental kitchen garden and swaths of meadows that were gently and patiently coaxed back from scrubland.\n\nBut the 15th-century house, which sits in a deep basin with pasture and woodland rising up around it, had originally been part of a much larger estate of 160 acres. In 2022 this \u201clost\u201d land \u2014 the largest single Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in Wales \u2014 became available to buy. \u201cIt always felt like we were connected to the landscape,\u201d says Maynard. \u201cBut bringing the land back in ownership with the house \u2014 all of a sudden, the house had a completely different feel and a different purpose. It was like a divorce that we reunited.\u201d\n\nThe land had been largely unmanaged, which meant an enormous variety of wild flowers had flourished \u2014 but so too had pernicious weeds. \u201cMost of the land was covered with brambles and bracken, some of it to chest height,\u201d explains Collinson, who first had to repeatedly flail the land to clear it, a process they had already carried out on the wild-flower meadows. \u201cThe pastures regenerated quickly, and the bank of wild flowers in those areas which we\u2019ve uncovered has been fantastic. We have huge quantities of orchids. They\u2019re just everywhere. You can\u2019t step on to the pastures without standing on an orchid.\u201d\n\nPart of the management plan set out by Natural Resources Wales \u2014 who oversee the SSSI designation \u2014 was that the land should be grazed properly, and that provided Collinson with the opportunity to realise a long-held dream. He\u2019s descended from a long line of farmers \u2014 his maternal ancestors had farmed a block of land on the Somerset Levels since the Domesday.\n\nThey acquired a small herd of White Park cattle in 2022. It\u2019s an ancient breed \u2014 its distinctive head, with long elegant horns, has been the logo of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust since its inception in 1973, when there were only around 65 breeding females of White Park left; there are around 750 today. It\u2019s widely considered to be the most ancient British breed, descended from the country\u2019s original wild white cattle and prized for its hardy nature. For the novice farmer, this was a key consideration, since the herd can happily live outside year round.\n\nBut the White Park is also valued for its excellent foraging abilities and gentle grazing, making it the perfect breed for coaxing back the land, clearing overgrown patches and opening it up in \u201ca completely natural way\u201d. Once the process of clearing patches begins, the cows then go in and forage to fully clear it, exposing the soil and, at the same time, exposing the seed bank, allowing native wild flowers to grow and kick-starting a regenerative cycle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see how the land is improving, to see how the land has become different during the period of our ownership. You can see quite clearly how our pasture is different,\u201d says Maynard. The grasses on their land are all native, in contrast with modern hybrid grasses used on many nearby farms. \u201cPastures owned by farmers who farm more intensively and fertilise look completely different. Ours feels medieval.\u201d\n\nAs well as a sea of orchids, including the common spotted orchid and southern marsh orchid, the land is now rich with wild flowers including cardamine, knapweed, cranesbills, yarrow, vetch, buttercups, sorrel and betony. Abundant birdlife has followed, including nightingales in summer.\n\nThe White Park herd roams between pasture and woodland, allowing it to self-medicate with herbs and wild flowers, and to eat bark from hazel and fruit trees. \u201cIn the old days, farmers used to cut green branches to feed the cattle and they would graze off all the lower leaves,\u201d says Maynard. \u201cThey might kill off the young bark of hazel, but there\u2019s this whole ecosystem that starts to happen.\u201d\n\nConservation grazing has grown substantially over the past 15 to 20 years says Christopher Price, chief executive of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. In the charity\u2019s latest watchlist rare breeds including Dartmoor sheep, New Forest ponies, saddleback pigs and native goat breeds are among those increasing in number. It\u2019s a welcome return. \u201cThe landscapes and habitats that we cherish were largely created by wild or semi-feral grazing animals,\u201d says Price.\n\nMaynard and Collinson currently have 13 cows. Caring for the herd has, says Collinson, been a daily adventure, everything from dealing with the grisly fallout from a broken horn (\u201cshocking in the extreme\u201d) to the awe of the first calves being born last spring. The cows take themselves off to find a hollow or dense copse where they give birth alone, before calling for the rest of the herd, who then form a protective cr\u00e8che for the new addition.\n\n\u201cEvery day I\u2019m learning something new,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey are quite docile, quite friendly, but terribly strong. You can rub their noses, and they\u2019ll eat out of your hand. And I know them well, but they\u2019re also wilful. They won\u2019t do what they don\u2019t want to do.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d like to slowly expand the herd to perhaps 15 or 20 in total. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be enough to make any kind of a living from, but the sense of wellbeing that comes from managing them is fantastic.

And Heathrow believes that they can as well,\u201d Reeves told the BBC.\n\n\u201cI believe [sustainable aviation fuels] are a game-changer in the way that we fly and the carbon emissions,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the government is only expecting 22 per cent of UK jet fuel to be supplied by SAF by 2040, according to a document dated December 2024.\n\nSAF is made from a diverse range of sources, including crops, used cooking oil, household waste or hydrogen and can emit about 70 per cent less carbon dioxide over its life cycle than traditional aviation fuel.\n\nIt is also much more expensive than traditional jet fuel and is currently only available in small quantities.\n\nThe government in January introduced a mandate that required fuel producers to supply a portion of SAF for flights departing the UK.\n\nThe mandate is for 2 per cent of fuel to be SAF this year and steadily rises to reach 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040.\n\nThe targets are in line with the aviation industry\u2019s road map to reach net zero by 2050, which is heavily reliant on SAF but includes other measures such as more efficient conventional jets and air traffic control management.\n\nBut Tim Johnson, the director of the Aviation Environment Federation, said that under current forecasts the aviation industry would need all the available SAF in the UK in 2035 just to meet the growth in flight numbers from a third runway at Heathrow.\n\n\u201cThis is not just this government having an over-optimistic take on SAF. It is consistent with every government in the world, because falling back on SAF allows them to continue to pursue growth,\u201d he said.\n\nAirlines are concerned that not enough SAF is being produced to hit the government\u2019s targets and some have suggested that the SAF mandates might need to be watered down.\n\nTo help build a homegrown SAF industry, airlines and airports have urged ministers to speed up the rollout of a financial support mechanism to encourage investors to put money into production.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be an alignment between the hugely welcome language around growth and boosting capacity at airports and incentivising the production of SAF,\u201d said Tim Alderslade, chief executive of lobby group Airlines UK.\n\nThe government has outlined plans for an industry-funded \u201crevenue certainty mechanism\u201d, which would guarantee a minimum price for the fuel, similar to schemes used to underwrite nuclear and offshore wind projects.\n\nBut it is not expected to be introduced until the end of next year.\n\nA Government spokesperson said:\u00a0\u201cWe are committed to delivering greener aviation to support our mission to kick-start economic growth and to make Britain a clean energy superpower.\n\n\u201cWe are already making great strides in the path to greener aviation, with new targets for sustainable aviation fuel starting this year.

None have been financed or built.\n\nGlobal SAF production volumes reached 1.3bn litres last year and accounted for 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production, according to Iata.\n\nGiven the challenges to scaling up SAF globally, Al Adhami said the UK was still ahead of many other countries, following its introduction of both the mandate and promise of a revenue support mechanism.\n\n\u201cAt least now from a risk perspective and the capital we have invested in the UK, there is more certainty,\u201d he said.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/78c3705d-d484-48ce-adfb-ffc827fc0646"}, {"uuid4": "ece748f1-543d-4407-90dc-8ec7f72a52c8", "title": "The contradictions at the heart of Rachel Reeves\u2019 growth plan ", "description": "Red lines hobble the chancellor\u2019s ambitions ", "author": "Gordon Smith", "published_date": "2025-01-30T17:00:43.354Z", "content": "Good afternoon on this, the eve of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the week that Rachel Reeves tried to put the rocket-boosters under Labour\u2019s economic growth strategy.\n\nHer upbeat speech in Oxford observed that getting Britain growing again was based on three pillars: political stability, regulatory reform and the combination of private and public investment.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much to disagree with, but because of the damage done by the Budget, it will take more than a sprightly speech for Reeves to dispel the underlying sense that this is a government still struggling to find the \u201cpolitical stability\u201d that is essential if they are to plausibly present themselves as agents of enduring change.\n\nReeves praised MakeUK, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, but reacting to the speech, chief executive Stephen Phipson warned that the government needed to resolve the contradiction between its growth-suppressing Budget and the paper ambitions set out by the chancellor.\n\nAnd therein lies the challenge.\n\nThe headline announcements that the government is backing a third runway at Heathrow, is getting behind the Oxford-Cambridge Arc again and will support the Manchester United regeneration project sends a clear signal to international investors that the UK is \u201copen for business\u201d.\n\nLess clear is whether a government led by a prime minister who is now less popular than Rishi Sunak at his nadir, has the political gumption to make the arguments necessary to deliver on ambitions that will pay relatively slow dividends.\n\nThis is not to be churlish, but to observe that Reeves\u2019 speech was delivered by a chancellor already on the back foot. Last summer this would have sounded like Labour firing the starting gun on its rescue mission for Britain, not a government trying to rescue itself.\n\nNew administrations usually start with an announcements phase followed by a period of delivery and then a recrimination phase when, inevitably, they come up short.

As Local council leaders in Cambridge told me this week \u2014 including the Labour leader of Cambridge City council, Mike Davey \u2014 it\u2019s imperative that this government doesn\u2019t repeat the political mistakes of the last one and lose public goodwill.\n\nAs Lucy Nethsingha, the Liberal Democrat leader of Cambridgeshire county council, put it:\n\nTo put in context the scale of the task. Reeves announced that the Environment Agency had finally cleared the long-delayed 5,400 home new town development at Waterbeach in Cambridge.\n\nBut according to research by Public First for the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster Board seen by the Financial Times, the region will need 15,000 homes a year on average to hit a high-growth trajectory \u2014 that\u2019s a threefold increase above 2023 levels in Greater Cambridge, Oxford and Milton Keynes.\n\nBrexit blues\n\nThe Budget is not the only place where election manifesto red lines have generated policy contradictions that are now hobbling Reeves in her growth mission.\n\nThe chancellor talked about the need for greater investment and trade, but the UK\u2019s \u201creset\u201d with Europe \u2014 which might have convinced investors that the UK was \u201cback\u201d \u2014 is severely limited by the decision to rule out rejoining a customs union or the EU single market.\n\nFive years after the TCA came into force, what is notable is how little anything has changed, despite the change of government.\n\nLabour pledged to \u201ctear down the barriers to trade\u201d with the EU while sticking to the same Tory red lines that created the Tories\u2019 \u201cfailed\u201d Brexit deal \u2014 Reeves\u2019 words, not mine \u2014 in the first place.\n\nThere was some positivity this week when (finally) the UK indicated it would look to relink the UK and EU carbon-pricing schemes and may consider joining the Pan-Euro Mediterranean customs agreement, but like Reeves\u2019 growth plans, for now these are paper commitments.\n\nEU officials now tell my colleagues in Brussels they expect a UK-EU summit \u201cin the first half\u201d of the year. That could be April or June, given the purdah period around local elections in May. The EU then needs to collectively agree a mandate. Don\u2019t expect talks until September or even October.\n\nAnd as the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank observed in its comprehensive survey of the past five years, Labour\u2019s plans for the EU reset, including a veterinary agreement and a deal for creative artists will deliver only marginal reductions in friction.\n\n\u201cWhilst benefiting certain sectors, these proposals would do little to address the overall economic impact of Brexit,\u201d it found.\n\nThe reality, as we reported this week, is that the EU \u201creset\u201d discussion is going nowhere fast, with even the legally non-binding Security Partnership now hung up on the familiar issues of fish and youth mobility, including restoring the rights of EU students to pay \u201chome\u201d fees when they come and study at UK universities.\n\nYou can blame the EU, and the French in particular, for being stuck playing old tunes about \u201cno cherry picking\u201d despite the strategic fears over Ukraine, but in truth the UK has done nothing to really shift the dial or build momentum. It has put no prizes on the table that would make EU member states behave any differently.\n\nAs with the October Budget and business, the government has managed to put itself into the \u201crecrimination phase\u201d with Brussels before it has even announced what it wants. That is a remarkable own-goal.\n\nIn a braver world, Starmer would have done a fast deal on fish (the last government already failed the fishermen) and embraced youth mobility as a cultural and economic opportunity, driving the negotiation with Brussels into a genuinely different place.\n\nIndeed, even very recently, as the Treasury and No 10 went into panic mode over growth, there was a moment to make arguments that going deeper with the EU should be part of the fix, as much as a third runway at Heathrow.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t happen, trapped as the government is by its framing of the problem and the potential opportunity. As one despairing Whitehall insider put it: \u201cIt is eerily reminiscent of 2017. We are now in serious danger of sinking back into a low-ambition doomloop.\u201d\n\nAre you enjoying The State of Britain newsletter?

But at The Dreamery, an otherworldly new wine bar and ice-cream parlour in leafy De Beauvoir Town, north London, they come together magically.\n\nThe pint-sized bar is the work of Alex Young and George de Vos, also the creators of Goodbye Horses, a convivial natural wine bar and restaurant on the same street that proved one of the underground hits of 2024. Around the same time, the pair also launched Day Trip, an artisan coffee shop in the same building. \u201cBoth George and I see creating hospitality venues as creating worlds in themselves,\u201d says Young, who used to work in tech. \u201cWe wanted to create a little village, an ecosystem that has a feeling of escapism.\u201d\n\nIce-cream and wine can be a tricky match from a purely technical point of view, as the sweetness of the former can make the latter taste flat. But whatever nuance is lost in the pairing is far outweighed by the spirit of fun it creates. \u201cOur approach to pairing is rather\u00a0anarchic,\u201d admits Young.\n\nThere\u2019s an improvisational feel to the whole enterprise \u2013 yet there are some significant names behind the scenes. Goodbye Horses was designed by the Swiss architect Leopold Banchini, who also has a permanent installation at the Centre Pompidou. The courtyard garden at Day Trip was created by garden designer Jihae Hwang, who has won several gold medals at the Chelsea Flower Show. Head of wine at Goodbye Horses is Nathalie Nelles, formerly of Noble Fine Liquor. De Vos himself was formerly GM of Brilliant Corners, a music venue and Japanese restaurant in Dalston.\n\nThe Dreamery is housed in an ex-grocer\u2019s shop. There is no sign outside \u2013 just a steamed-up three-paned window filled with animated silhouettes against a wash of colourful lights. The front door looks just like any other on the Victorian terraced street; but then you notice the stoop, which is painted, slightly spookily, with rune-like suns, moons and birds. Inside, it has the bones of an espresso bar \u2013 there are stainless-steel counters and mirrored walls. But the eye is drawn to the ceiling, where a dazzling backlit mural by artist Lucy Stein fills the space with colour. In the corner, a 1980s-style boombox plays whimsical Studio Ghibli scores.\n\nGoodbye Horses chef Jack Coggins makes all the ice-creams, which are chalked up in marker pen on the wall: on\u00a0my visit they included fig leaf, prune & oolong tea, gingerbread and pear and verjus sorbet (\u00a34 per scoop). There\u2019s no printed drinks list, which will irritate some, but\u00a0there\u2019s a small, regularly changing selection of easy-drinking, \u201cglou-glou\u201d wines: sparkling ros\u00e9 moscato; crunchy, red-berry beaujolais served cool; Alsatian riesling and one or two dessert wines (from \u00a37.50 a glass). The emphasis is on natural and low-intervention producers.\n\nI squeeze in at the bar and order a post-prandial scoop of coffee and butterscotch, and a glass of tawny passito moscato by Cascina Cerutti, which is caramelised and nutty; my friend has the fig-leaf ice-cream and a glass of lychee-scented riesling. Both wines have a degree of natural sweetness and so the end result is actually lovely.\n\nThe ice-cream comes in a stemmed steel gelato cup, like you might see in a cartoon. The wine glasses are printed with a crescent moon eating an ice-cream cone by Stein. Her folkloric illustrations are also a centrepiece of the more naturalistic Goodbye Horses across the street; they run the full length of the 10m bar and weave their way down the gauzy curtains. \u201cThere\u2019s a sort of childlike quality to Lucy\u2019s work,\u201d says Young, \u201clike you\u2019re seeing things with fresh eyes.\u201d\n\nOne influence for The Dreamery was the Paris bar Folderol, a fashionable glacerie-bar-\u00e0-vin in the 11th arrondissement. Young also tips\u00a0his hat to GlouGlou in Amsterdam, \u201cwhich has a big by-the-glass selection and is fun and easy-going in a way that wine bars often aren\u2019t\u201d. \u201cThe real guiding principle for all our bars is that we just want people to have a really nice time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more fun and joyous than eating ice-cream and drinking wine.\u201d\n\n@alicelascelles", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8caf3cb4-9962-4d1f-bd40-b216ead59113"}, {"uuid4": "de1225ba-9d7c-477b-8c1a-14f2e4bb8937", "title": "Crackdown on rogue university operators in England aims to cut loan fraud ", "description": "Department for Education pledges to improve the regulation of outsourced teaching   ", "author": "Maisie Grice", "published_date": "2025-01-30T15:36:45.772Z", "content": "Rogue operators that offer poor-quality courses on behalf of English universities in order to exploit the student loan system face a crackdown, under plans outlined by ministers on Thursday.\n\nThe Department for Education is proposing reforms to tighten controls on university franchising arrangements, after an investigation by the National Audit Office found fraudulent providers cost taxpayers \u00a32mn in 2022-23.\n\nUnder the plans, course operators with more than 300 students will need to register with the Office for Students \u201cto ensure their courses meet rigorous quality standards\u201d in order to receive funding, or face fines or possible suspension.\n\nMore than half of 341 franchised institutions are currently unregistered, the department said on Thursday.\n\nThe growing number of franchised providers in higher education has been partly driven by the financial crisis facing universities, which are looking to increase student numbers in a bid to offset high costs and a long-running freeze in domestic tuition fees.\n\nThe number of students enrolling on franchised courses more than doubled from 50,400 in 2018-19 to over 130,000 this academic year, according to departmental figures.\n\nThe NAO report found that 53 per cent of the \u00a34.1mn fraud detected by the Student Loans Company involved courses from franchised providers, despite accounting for only 6.5 per cent of total loan-funded students during the 2022-23 academic year.\n\nThe investigation uncovered a range of fraudulent activity, including loans being paid to students who had not met course admission criteria and were unable to provide an acceptance letter to the Student Loans Company, the government body that oversees course financing.\n\nIt also found that some providers were not checking whether students were attending their courses despite this being a condition of loan funding.\n\nSome franchised providers also used agents or paid cash bonuses to persuade students to sign up to courses, it found.\n\nEducation secretary Bridget Phillipson said: \u201cWe are committed to cracking down on rogue operators who misuse public money and damage the reputation of our world-class universities.\n\n\u201cThe credibility of our universities is at stake, but these proposals seek to protect students and safeguard taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d\n\nThe DfE\u2019s move to protect standards in the higher education sector comes during a period of financial uncertainty for universities.\n\nSeveral universities have reopened voluntary severance schemes, which could potentially lead to the loss of nearly 1,000 jobs, as they struggle to recruit lucrative international students, whose fees account for a growing share of the sector\u2019s income.\n\nData published on Thursday by the university admissions service Ucas revealed that a number of Russell Group universities were among the dozens of institutions hit by a double-digit decline in new international undergraduates during the 2024 application cycle.\n\nThe hardest hit Russell Group members were Newcastle University and the University of Sheffield, where admissions declined 26 per cent and 23 per cent respectively.\n\nNewcastle University announced its voluntary severance scheme last week in an attempt to save \u00a320mn, 5 per cent of its pay budget \u2014 or the equivalent of 300 full-time positions, according to a memo seen by the Financial Times.\n\nNewcastle University said it was \u201cnot immune\u201d to the funding challenges facing the higher education sector.\n\nUniversities outside of the Russell Group have also been affected. The University of East Anglia is looking to reduce its headcount by 163 full-time equivalent staff in order to save \u00a311mn, despite experiencing a 73 per cent increase in international undergraduate admissions for the current academic year.\n\nJo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said her organisation was willing to ballot for strike action in response to job cuts. \u201cOur members refuse to stand by and allow university managers to commit academic vandalism on such a grand scale\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Unfortunately, serious industrial unrest cannot be ruled out.\u201d\n\nCardiff University on Tuesday announced plans to cut 400 jobs, as well as the merging of departments and cuts to multiple courses including nursing.\n\nThe Department for Education said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been up front about the tough financial situation we\u2019ve inherited in relation to [higher education] providers in England, and we are determined to put our universities on a secure footing after years of financial challenges.\u201d\n\nThe government announced last year that tuition fees would start to rise in line with inflation from 2025-26.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f7ff474c-4934-47c2-bcde-2effb9ffe0d4"}, {"uuid4": "77680501-4143-453d-9a7f-47fb554c2b99", "title": "Inflation and interest rates tracker: see how your country compares", "description": "Inflationary pressures are beginning to wane but not all central banks have taken action yet.

Or you could say \u2018to operate here, we give you a tax break\u2019.\u201d\n\nMahon is pushing for a new quality \u201ctrustmark\u201d to indicate fact-checked content from professionally produced and regulated media, and urged better means of monetisation for news providers on social media platforms.\n\nShe worries how social media giants such as TikTok, Meta and YouTube avoided responsibility for the content on their sites because they are not classified as publishing businesses \u2014 unlike broadcasters.\n\n\u201cWe put rules on television when it took up a vast amount of people\u2019s time\u201d to comply with them, she said. \u201cAll these platforms are pretending not to be publishers.\u201d\n\nTraditional broadcasters such as Channel 4 are fighting for their future on digital platforms, where their audiences have migrated to but where making money can be harder. The Financial Times this week revealed plans by Sky News to shift resources away from its linear channel to premium paid content.\n\nMahon said Channel 4 was \u201cway ahead\u201d of rivals in its transition to digital, while the group would also diversify its revenue over the next five years by creating its own TV shows for the first time.\n\nThe UK changed the law last year to allow Channel 4 to make and own rights to its own productions for the first time in its 40-year history, rather than outsource production to the independent sector.\n\nThis could include taking equity stakes in TV production groups, Mahon said, but Channel 4 would not spend \u201cbillions buying companies\u201d.\n\nChannel 4 had 1.83bn views on social media platforms last year, the majority on TikTok. It has weekly \u201creach\u201d of about 35mn on social media, about eight times greater than on live television.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/48f492df-428f-4501-a4db-04fec67cdb53"}, {"uuid4": "b3c47797-011f-4176-a6d1-f34980c62c37", "title": "Rachel Reeves draws battle lines with her bets to fix low growth  ", "description": "Oxford-Cambridge arc may help Labour outmanoeuvre Tories but new runway will provoke ire from its own voters", "author": "Georgina Quach", "published_date": "2025-01-30T09:30:10.907Z", "content": "Good morning. Rachel Reeves delivered her big speech on growth. It contained a number of measures: some good (the Oxford/Cambridge arc tops that list), some bad (the third runway at Heathrow) and some added to give the list of growth initiatives the appearance of a more even regional distribution (the regeneration of Old Trafford).\n\nSome thoughts on the political implications and challenges of them below.\n\nRachel Reeves announced (or in some cases re-announced) a swath of measures as part of her drive to fix the most alarming chart in British politics.\n\nThis is the biggest subplot to essentially everything else in British politics. Our economic model took a huge hit in the global financial crisis, it hasn\u2019t recovered since, and everything that successive governments have tried to fix the problem hasn\u2019t worked. (And some of the things they have done, Brexit most of all, have actively made the problem worse.)\n\nOur lack of growth makes everything harder, politically speaking. (To make matters worse, despite being an ageing island nation with sluggish economic growth, we completely failed to learn or even show much interest in Japan, a country that managed those challenges rather better than we did.) Because of that, we have seen both main parties electing leaders from their outer flanks \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn in 2017 and Liz Truss in 2022. It is also why no UK prime minister since David Cameron has been re-elected to a second term and why no prime minister since Tony Blair has served two full terms.\n\nThe best and most exciting measure that Rachel Reeves outlined was the government\u2019s revived backing for the Oxford-Cambridge arc, a strategic plan to build transport links and housing between the two science-rich hubs.\n\nThis was not strictly speaking \u201cnew\u201d as Peter Kyle had announced it at the start of the week. The arc has a lot of cross-party support, but it was shelved by Boris Johnson. While his electoral coalition had relatively few voters who would benefit most from the arc, it had an awful lot of people who would have objected to the required extra building.\n\nLabour\u2019s backing for the arc, and the accompanying approval for much-needed infrastructure improvements such as reservoirs, is another signal that the government essentially regards the very rural seats it won for the first time in 2024 as \u201cone-and-done\u201d victories. That approach has some real negative consequences (the cocktail of changes to inheritance tax and other reliefs for agriculture will, I think, have some unwanted consequences and Labour will end up U-turning on them sooner or later). But it also has some great upsides, of which backing the Oxford-Cambridge arc is right at the top.\n\nYou can see the dividing line that Reeves wants here, politically: the Conservatives will be pushed into opposing the development and disruption that investing in the arc involves because of their imperative to compete with the Liberal Democrats in those seats where voters might be resistant to building. And then Labour, Reeves hopes, will be able to say \u201cwell, what you would do differently?\u201d\n\nThe chancellor has also urged Heathrow to fast-track proposals to build a third runway: I am frankly unconvinced by this as, indeed, are much of the cabinet. (Do read this excellent piece on the legal and political hurdles that still remain to its construction here.) In the short term, it feels like a good way for the government to lose friends and alienate people among environmentally-inclined voters. It also sets up a fun game that interviewers will be able to play whenever speaking to anyone in the cabinet or front bench who voted against expansion in 2018, asking what, exactly, in their view has changed. (I really don\u2019t think some overly optimistic wishful thinking about \u201csustainable aviation fuels\u201d is going to cut it on this one.)\n\nMore importantly, given that the government is only going to be able to get away with antagonising its base on so many issues, in terms of its impact on growth and investment, watering down the government\u2019s plans on employment rights gets you far more in terms of business investment and happiness than the third runway.\n\nI saw The Brutalist last night. Personally, I would say: don\u2019t bother. Danny Leigh\u2019s review is exactly right, down to the most damning observation of all, that the film loses its brilliance with the arrival of \u201ca large, dark plot point that, in common with the whole movie, I\u2019ve liked less the more I\u2019ve thought about it\u201d.

However, some industry executives have raised questions over the start-up nature of XLCC, which has never built HVDC cable before.\n\nOne developer also said a key risk would be a slower-than-expected rollout of offshore wind farms in the UK, reducing potential orders.\n\nCraig Stevens, investment director at SNIB, said the bank had\u00a0taken comfort from\u00a0XLCC\u00a0working with strategic technical partners such as China\u2019s Orient Cable to produce and test the cable.\u00a0XLCC said it had hired experts in HVDC manufacturing and was using tried-and-tested technology.\n\nOne potential XLCC customer is a subsea electricity interconnector from Morocco to the UK envisioned by Xlinks, a company founded by Simon Morrish, who is also behind XLCC. But the project is awaiting UK government approval.\n\nXLCC this month received a \u00a320mn investment from SNIB, building on the UK\u2019s National\u00a0Wealth Fund\u2019s earlier initial investment of \u00a320mn, with the option for an extra \u00a367mn as development progresses.\n\nSNIB, which was founded in 2020 as a development bank, had been established to take on more risk and fund start-ups and growth companies in sectors needed to revitalise the Scottish economy, Fidao said.\n\nThe XLCC facility would support about 900 long-term jobs, including more than 200 apprenticeships, with a further 300 project management roles expected to be based in Scotland.\n\nExpanding Scottish ports, Fidao added, was a priority given the significant quaysides expansion needed to assemble the infrastructure for the rollout of more offshore wind farms.\n\nOne of SNIB\u2019s largest investments to date is a co-investment with the UK into US-owned Ardersier port on the Moray Firth, an inlet of the North Sea.\n\nScotland has a pipeline of 40 gigawatts of offshore wind projects, all of which will require subsea cables to transfer the power ashore.\n\n\u201cProjects are getting delayed, prices are very high,\u201d said Ian Douglas, XLCC\u2019s chief executive. \u201cCompanies are fighting very hard to secure supply \u2014 you are typically seeing seven-year waits for HVDC cable.\u201d\n\nEuropean cable manufacturers, such as Milan-listed Prysmian, Paris-listed Nexans and Copenhagen-listed NKT, already had full order books, he added.\n\nPrysmian said: \u201cWhilst we have large backlog visibility, to suggest that our order book is full is incorrect.\u201d The company added that it was \u201cworking closely with its customers to deliver on time current, and future projects, and is receiving, and bidding for future orders\u201d.\n\nThe first phase of the XLCC facility\u2019s construction envisions 1,300km a year capacity with the potential to rise to 2,600km a year. Global demand in 2030 was forecast at 10,000km a year, XLCC said.\n\nThe Scottish National party government also hopes to incentivise uptake for supply chain companies, such as XLCC, by encouraging renewables developers that source equipment from domestic sources.\n\nSeabed lease agreements for projects from the late 2020s include requirements for local supply chain involvement.\n\n\u201cThat will propel manufacturing \u2014 it is going to be extremely important to demonstrate local supply chain,\u201d said Gillian Martin, acting secretary for net zero and energy. \u201cCompanies will even now be looking at this place for their cables.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8ce06f13-c09c-42b4-ba65-d29d4983d60d"}, {"uuid4": "9c2a65e6-40fc-48ed-ae1b-a89846142998", "title": "Car production at UK plants falls below 1mn vehicles ", "description": "European exports slide as carmakers wrestle with slowing sales of EVs in Germany and France", "author": "Kana Inagaki", "published_date": "2025-01-30T00:01:33.744Z", "content": "Falling exports and the winding down of production of older car models saw UK vehicle manufacturing fall by almost 12 per cent last year, in the worst annual drop since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nCar and van production at British plants fell back below 1mn vehicles, to 905,233 models, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders released on Thursday showed.\n\nThe decline came on the back of weaker exports to Europe as carmakers wrestled with slowing sales of electric vehicles in key markets such as Germany and France.\n\nNissan and Jaguar Land Rover \u2014 the UK\u2019s two largest carmakers \u2014 also halted production of several models such as the Leaf EV and the Jaguar XE as they prepared to launch a new range of EVs.\n\n\u201cAmid significant geopolitical and trade tensions, UK manufacturers are set on turning billions of pounds of investment into production reality,\u201d Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT said. \u201cGrowing pains are inevitable.\u201d\n\nThe production of EVs and plug-in hybrids last year fell by 20.4 per cent, but still accounted for just over a third of all vehicles produced.

Its own research showed that many households had already cut spending on essentials such as food and heating to afford bills.\n\nThe increases come in the wake of warnings from Ofwat over the financial stability of 10 companies, which receive nearly all their revenues from customer bills.\n\nThames Water and Southern Water, which are under particular scrutiny, are understood to be weighing an appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority after receiving lower bill increases from Ofwat in December than they had hoped.\n\nThe chief executives of both utilities took large bonuses last year despite suffering credit downgrades.

The Liberal premier warned Canadians that the nation \u201ccould be facing difficult times in the coming days and weeks\u201d.\n\nCanada\u2019s former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, who is running to replace Trudeau, on Friday urged Ottawa to retaliate against any US tariffs by adding huge levies on Tesla vehicles to punish Elon Musk, one of Trump\u2019s top allies.\n\nTrump indicated he was unmoved by economists\u2019 warnings that new tariffs would hurt the US economy or risk a leap in inflation as importers passed on the increased cost of their goods to consumers.\n\n\u201cTariffs don\u2019t cause inflation, they cause success,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Democrats warned much of the burden would be passed on to American consumers. \u201cDonald Trump is aiming his new tariffs at Mexico, Canada and China but they will likely hit Americans in their wallets,\u201d said Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader.\n\n\u201cIf these tariffs go into full effect, they will raise prices for everything from groceries, to cars, to gas, making it even harder for middle-class families to just get by.\u201d\n\nTrump first threatened to hit Canada, Mexico and China with steep tariffs in November, accusing them of allowing illegal migration and not doing enough to halt trade in fentanyl, an illegal and deadly opioid.\n\nBusiness lobbyists in Washington, worried about the effects on US supply chains and the costs of goods, had hoped that the president would take a more moderate approach and not immediately apply a 25 per cent levy.\n\nOther options included delaying the tariffs to allow the Canadian and Mexican governments more time to negotiate with the Trump team over border security, or introducing the tariffs gradually and increasing them over time.Additional reporting by Harriet Clarfelt", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ff8116f0-b01f-4687-934a-a1b8a07bd5b0"}, {"uuid4": "befb430a-f109-4ca2-b1a1-b6b246f173c6", "title": "Former Federal Reserve official accused of passing secrets to China", "description": "Justice department alleges John Rogers accessed sensitive information including briefings and policy deliberations", "author": "Stefania Palma", "published_date": "2025-02-01T22:28:12.128Z", "content": "A former senior Federal Reserve official was arrested on Friday after US prosecutors accused him of passing on economic secrets to China.\n\nJohn Rogers, a senior adviser in the Fed\u2019s international finance division from 2010-21, used his position to access sensitive data on China-related tariffs, briefings to officials and policy debates and announcements, according to an indictment unsealed on Friday in federal court in Washington.\n\nRogers, 63, of Virginia, was accused of transferring sensitive information to his personal email account before printing it out and passing it on to Chinese officials disguised as graduate students. He also used encrypted messaging apps to communicate with Chinese officials, the indictment said.\n\nThe justice department on Friday said Rogers had \u201cunder the guise of teaching \u2018classes\u2019,\u201d met his co-conspirators in Chinese hotel rooms where he gave them sensitive trade secret information that belonged to the Fed.\n\nIt added the economist had been paid about $450,000 as a part-time professor at Fudan University in China.\n\nRogers denies the allegations, his attorney said.\n\nThe indictment is the latest in a rising number of cases in which officials from across the US government \u2014 and particularly agencies such as the CIA and the military \u2014 have been charged with providing sensitive or secret information to the Chinese government.\n\nIn recent years, the justice department has also become more public about highlighting cases to underscore the threat from Chinese espionage. Washington has accused Chinese hackers of attacking US telecoms networks in a massive and widespread campaign that has allowed the perpetrators to access the conversations of American officials.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington said it was \u201cnot familiar\u201d with the specifics of the Rogers\u2019s case, but said China \u201cupholds the rule of law\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe oppose any smear and attack on China with so-called \u2018spy risks\u2019,\u201d the embassy added.\n\nThe Chinese government is one of the biggest global holders of US government bonds.

Mexico\u2019s capital is seen as a safer option than border areas, with more work opportunities and public transport.\n\n\u201cWe want to go to Mexico City to at least work, clear our minds as time passes,\u201d Luis said.\n\nFor the past year, cities along the US-Mexico border had been much quieter than previously, with shelters below capacity and irregular crossings down. That resulted from a crackdown by Mexican authorities, tighter US restrictions, and more legal pathways to cross through the app.\n\nBut for many migrants, returning home \u2014 whether to Venezuela, other countries in the region or parts of Mexico plagued by violence linked to drug cartels \u2014 is not an option. Many said they still hoped to reach the US eventually.\n\n\u201cGoing to the US is illogical, we can\u2019t get there\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but it\u2019s also dangerous here in Ju\u00e1rez,\u201d

mark a sharp escalation in the trade dispute with Washington, which blew into the open after Trump said he would impose tariffs on the US\u2019s two biggest trading partners from February 1.\n\nThe White House on Friday reiterated its plan to impose the tariffs starting on Saturday.\n\nTrudeau also on Friday said Canada was ready to retaliate against the US: \u201cWe\u2019re ready with a response \u2014 a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\u201d he said, as he warned Canadians, \u201cour nation could be facing difficult times in the coming days and

potential retaliatory tariffs on $200bn worth of American imports would show where \u201cwe can hit Trump where it hurts\u201d.\n\n\u201cBy targeting products from Republican states that voted for Trump and products made by his billionaire buddies, Canada can exert unavoidable political pressure on the White House,\u201d she said.\n\nCanada previously imposed 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, in a move that followed similar levies on Chinese EVs announced by Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nFreeland\u2019s comments also came as M\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, held last-gasp talks in Washington to try to avert Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nJoly used a Financial Times interview on Friday to warn the US that any disruption to energy flows between Canada and its southern neighbours triggered by a trade war would leave American oil refiners dependent on alternative heat oil supplies from Venezuela.\n\nJoly also vowed Canada would never become a \u201ccolony\u201d, in a reference to Trump\u2019s claims that Canadians would like to join the US and his repeated goading of Trudeau, who he has called a \u201cgovernor\u201d of the \u201c51st state\u201d.\n\nCanada and Mexico have drawn up lists of \u201ctit for tat\u201d tariffs to issue against the US as soon as Trump imposes tariffs.\n\nMexico\u2019s left-wing president Claudia Sheinbaum said earlier this week that she did not think the 25 per cent tariffs would happen on Saturday, but on Friday said the government was planning for different scenarios.\n\n\u201cWe have a plan A, plan B and a plan C, whatever the United States government decides,\u201d she said on Friday morning.\n\nDan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said a tariff war would be a huge concern for small Canadian businesses as more than half their members import goods from the US.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s new best friend is Elon and targeting these type of people

for the first time at the White House on Friday, as Washington and Silicon Valley weigh their responses to Chinese start-up DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthrough.The meeting between Trump and Huang was to include discussion of AI policy, according to a person familiar with the discussion. On his first day in office, Trump revoked a Biden administration executive order focused on AI safety and has generally been seen by tech executives as accelerating America\u2019s advances in the fast-moving technology.Two people familiar with the meeting said it had been planned before DeepSeek stunned Silicon Valley with AI advances apparently achieved using far less computing power than US tech groups. The news wiped almost $600bn from the value of Nvidia, one of the biggest winners from spending on AI chips, on Monday. Neither the White House nor Nvidia disclosed details of the conversation afterwards, or whether specific agreements were made as a result of it. Speaking with reporters on Friday afternoon in the Oval Office, Trump called Huang a \u201cgreat gentleman\u201d and added the US would eventually put tariffs on computer chips. It was not clear if the chip tariffs were part of the discussion with Huang. Tariffs on chips and \u201cthings associated with chips\u201d were part of a sweeping plan announced by Trump on Friday for new restrictions on imports from the US\u2019s biggest trading partners.\u201cWe appreciated the opportunity to meet with President Trump and discuss semiconductors and AI policy,\u201d Nvidia said. \u201cJensen and the president discussed the importance of strengthening US technology and AI leadership.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s AI leap has sparked calls in Washington for the US government to tighten export controls further on AI-related technology to make it even harder for China to make advancements in the sector.\n\nOn Saturday, Singapore\u2019s government hit back at suggestions that DeepSeek could have acquired its AI chips from Nvidia\u2019s subsidiary in the city state, as a way of avoiding US export controls.\n\nUS authorities were reported to be investigating how DeepSeek accumulated the chips and were focusing on Singapore, which accounts for more than a fifth of Nvidia\u2019s revenues.\n\n\u201cWe expect US companies, like Nvidia, to comply with US export controls and our domestic legislation,\u201d Singapore\u2019s government said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur customs and law enforcement agencies will continue to work closely with their US counterparts.\u201d\n\nLast Monday, the same day DeepSeek released its latest model, Trump issued an executive order telling the state department and commerce department to review the US export control system \u201cin light of developments involving strategic adversaries\u201d.\n\nNvidia has long protested the expansion of US export controls that limit sales to China of its most powerful processors for AI. The Silicon Valley-based chipmaker has argued that constraining Chinese companies\u2019 access to American technology would only fuel China\u2019s innovation and development of its own local semiconductor industry.\n\nDeepSeek said its breakthrough AI model was created using a fraction of the computing resources of US rivals such as OpenAI or Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, which are assembling clusters of hundreds of thousands of chips. The final training run for its V3 model cost $5.6mn using just over 2,000 Nvidia chips, DeepSeek said in a research paper, although that figure excluded prior development costs.\n\nAnalysts at SemiAnalysis, a chip consultancy, have estimated that DeepSeek and its sister company, hedge fund High-Flyer, have access to about 60,000 Nvidia graphics processing units and have spent more than $500mn on chips to date.\n\nNvidia, which was the most valuable US company until Monday\u2019s stock market panic, was co-founded by Huang more than 30 years ago, turning the Taiwan-born businessman into one of America\u2019s richest people. He is now one of Silicon Valley\u2019s longest-serving CEOs.\n\nIn a letter to Mike Waltz, the new US national security adviser, the Republican chair and top Democrat on the House China committee, said the DeepSeek advance underscored the need for \u201cfrequently updating export controls\u201d. Josh Hawley, a Republican senator, has also introduced legislation that would prohibit the export to China of AI technology.\n\nAs the Biden administration tightened controls on what US chipmakers could sell in China since October 2022, Nvidia has continued to sell adapted versions of its AI chips there, alongside GPUs for the country\u2019s burgeoning PC gaming market. Customers with billing addresses in China, including Hong Kong, accounted for $11.6bn in revenues in the nine months ending in October, according to Nvidia\u2019s latest results.", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/65e9c766-9ff7-4ff8-bff1-2c1c05c9d802"}, {"uuid4": "da109bd6-ad4d-47d9-94fe-8f76fb5d9b74", "title": "Venezuela releases US prisoners and agrees to take deportees", "description": "Agreement struck in meeting between Trump\u2019s envoy and country\u2019s authoritarian leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ", "author": "Joe Daniels", "published_date": "2025-02-01T18:03:27.905Z", "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s crisis negotiator returned from Venezuela with six freed American prisoners after securing a commitment from the South American country\u2019s authoritarian leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to accept deported migrants.\n\nRichard Grenell, the US president\u2019s envoy for special missions, travelled to Venezuela on Friday to press Maduro to accept thousands of Venezuelan deportees, according to US officials, and to secure the release of US nationals taken prisoner by Caracas.\n\nDonald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Saturday: \u201cIt is so good to have the Venezuela Hostages back home and, very important to note, that Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their Country, all Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the U.S\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u201d\n\nThe Venezuelan government said in a statement that the talks were \u201crespectful\u201d and touched on migration, sanctions and detained US citizens, and that a \u201cfresh start\u201d was needed in relations between Washington and Caracas.

Russia, one of Maduro\u2019s backers, sent a government plane to Caracas that landed 15 minutes before Grenell\u2019s arrival on Friday.\n\nMaduro, a close ally of Russia and Iran, has been shunned by the west and much of Latin America after claiming victory in a presidential election last July whose result was widely regarded as fraudulent.

He held a private meeting with Maduro\u2019s top political operator Jorge Rodr\u00edguez in Mexico in 2020 in the final days of the first Trump administration.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez this week urged Trump not to cut a deal with Maduro, and the Venezuelan opposition has been alarmed by meetings it held with him before Grenell travelled to Caracas.\n\n\u201cGrenell\u2019s nonchalance and lack of concern for democracy and human rights has left everyone very concerned,\u201d said an opposition figure who did not want to be named. The opposition fears that business interests will lobby Trump to cut a deal giving the US more access to Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves, the world\u2019s biggest.\n\nTrump\u2019s own position on Venezuela is unclear.

But the strategy failed to dislodge Maduro, who remained in power with the help of Russia, China and Iran, while Guaid\u00f3 eventually fled to Florida.\n\n\u201cTrump regards the opposition as losers,\u201d the former official said. \u201cHe gave them a lot and they failed.

The New York Stock Exchange, the largest in the world, is one of a number of groups which are now looking to offer much longer trading windows.\n\nThis is pushing investment professionals to engage in surprisingly complex debates around the simplest-seeming questions.\n\nWhen, for example, does a trading day begin and end if it runs around the clock?

Other worries include how portfolio managers deal with the risks of big moves in their holdings while they\u2019re asleep, and the cost and difficulty of maintaining complex systems with little or no downtime.\n\n\u201cTalk 24-hour and the joke is, \u2018I don\u2019t know when our operations guy is going to sleep.\u2019 That is an actual issue,\u201d says Tyler Gellasch, chief executive of investor advocate Healthy Markets Association. \u201cBut I feel like that\u2019s going to be the least of your worries when you wake up to a margin call on a big position.\u201d\n\nBy some measures, stocks are already late to the overnight party.\n\nThe dollar trades 24 hours a day on various platforms around the world and dealing in S&P 500 index futures, which signal the likely market direction ahead of the New York opening, is brisk from the Tokyo morning onwards. Cryptocurrency investors, meanwhile, have never known anything but a 24-7 digital world.\n\nFrom the earliest days of informal trading in lower Manhattan coffee houses, US stock markets have largely stuck to some form of a traditional business day, though precise hours have varied.\n\nEven the rising power of west coast investors and companies has not altered the official New York 4pm close of business. The last major changes to the US day were made some two decades ago, when exchanges began offering pre- and after-market sessions that now run from 4am Eastern to the open, and from the close to 8pm Eastern, respectively.\n\nTraders in Los Angeles and San Francisco, three hours behind New York, suck up 5am starts for the joy of beating the traffic as they head home soon after 1pm on days when there is little to generate activity after 4pm in New York.\n\nDaytime trading for stocks is also practical because it involves so many parties: a million-plus people are employed directly in the US securities industry, and there are the executives of the companies whose shares are being traded and the regulators who oversee it all.\n\nAdding to the complexity is the sheer scale of the $50tn market. Some 12bn shares are traded daily through millions of transactions. The counterparties include giant pension funds, high-speed traders dealing in milliseconds and individual investors trading a handful of shares. Every transaction must be agreed, with money and shares changing hands the next day. On top of all this is a web of intricate rules designed to ensure fair dealing.\n\nBetween 8pm and 4am in New York, overnight trading, including on Robinhood, is now mostly conducted through Blue Ocean, a so-called alternative trading system that launched in 2021 specifically to offer overnight access. Members of these alternative systems \u2014 also known as \u201cdark pools\u201d \u2014 trade among themselves at prices that are not made public.\n\nWhile Blue Ocean\u2019s volumes, about 40mn shares a night, are a tiny fraction of what the likes of the NYSE do on any regular day, it has steadily built a market linking American night owls with Asian day traders. Now two exchanges are eyeing its turf.\n\nIn November, the Securities and Exchange Commission tentatively approved 24 Exchange, or 24X, a Bermuda-based group backed by hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 Ventures fund with plans to trade nearly all day long. Until recently, its main business had been currency trading. Once some key regulatory infrastructure is in place, it plans to open 23 hours a day with an hour for brokers to update their systems. Its approval makes it the first US exchange with an avowed goal of dealing overnight, although under industry pushback it shrank original plans that included weekend trading.\n\nNYSE too, may soon join the sleepless fray. The SEC is yet to weigh in on its separate plan, put forward by the exchange a month earlier, that would see it extend its trading day from the current 4am-8pm to a much lengthier 1.30am-11.30pm.\n\nThe involvement of exchanges matters for the rest of the market because they are more tightly supervised than dark pools and are responsible for continuously publishing their best bid (buy) and offer (sell) prices through their trading day. These flow through a service known colloquially as the \u201ctape\u201d, against which any investor can compare the price they got from their broker, who has an obligation to execute trades at the best price.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing from multiple types of market participants for about two years now that they think there is demand and opportunity to extend hours further,\u201d says Kevin Tyrrell, head of markets at NYSE.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also had global investors looking to the US more and more \u2014 for trading and investing and also large companies transferring their listings from other regions into the US. So it seems very natural for us to be having these conversations.\u201d\n\nBig industry reservations remain, however, from managing risk to having to operate all night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a solo game. Traders are always asking an analyst or a fund manager, \u2018Hey, does this new price point mean something?\u2019\u201d says one senior dealer at a large global investor. \u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest fear for folks, is that they end up on call 24 hours.\u201d\n\nIn June 2024, Justin Schack, a partner at Wall Street broker Rosenblatt Securities, appeared before a House committee looking into the US market set-up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that no one with a blank slate would design such a complex system to achieve such a simple task,\u201d Schack, who heads Rosenblatt\u2019s market structure team, told the politicians when describing the current system.\n\nOther Wall Street brokers agree. Ask them about the issues that 24-hour advocates must address and they list thorny ones: clearing or guaranteeing trades, building out technology and staffing, running the \u201ctape\u201d to cover longer hours and ensuring all their systems can cope.\n\nTraders have their concerns too, from how much stocks can move to whether regulators might factor overnight prices into how they apply daytime rules.\n\n\u201cWhat are the rules for overnight trading? If you did have a big price dislocation, where does the stock stop? Without clarity around specific items, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get institutional buy-in,\u201d says Mehmet Kinak, global head of equity trading at T Rowe Price, in a reference to the so-called circuit breakers operating in daylight hours, which temporarily halt a stock that moves particularly sharply.\n\nKinak adds that thin liquidity during extended hours makes it an unattractive time for big players to trade US stocks. \u201cWhat if a stock is indicated up 3 per cent and we happen to be a seller? By the time we are done executing an order for 200,000 shares, I\u2019m not going to get a price anywhere near up 3 per cent, there\u2019s just no depth or broad market participation.\u201d\n\nTo guard against wild swings that can catch investors out, overnight trades currently operate under a limit order system, meaning investors cannot simply send buy or sell instructions, but must set the price at which they will trade. If no one takes that price, the order expires unfilled in the morning.\n\nThe global head of trading for a west coast asset manager agrees with Kinak that overnight offers limited trading opportunities for big investors, but cautions that not trading might not remove the dangers.\n\n\u201cThe real questions, then, are about what we would have to consider in those hours for our oversight and technology,\u201d he says. \u201cCould a regulator come in and ask me about best execution, and point to prices overnight that I\u2019m not capturing as part of my process? That could create an obligation to staff markets 24 hours. That\u2019s a big burden to put on the entire industry.\u201d\n\nWhen the day starts and ends matters to investors everywhere too. Few in the industry want to change the official 4pm close \u2014 by far the busiest trading point in the current day because it is used to set the daily reference prices for traded securities, from which the $30tn-plus held in mutual and exchange traded funds take their value.\n\nAfter the close, an entire system of clearing and settlement also kicks in, ensuring that sellers receive their payment and buyers have their new holdings re-registered under their name.\n\nAdditionally, it is when systems are adjusted for changes to shares, such as a company altering the number of shares trading or announcing a dividend payment date. These adjustments move share prices and brokers bear the cost if they miss one: in 2023 Robinhood took a $57mn hit when its systems failed to register a company that shrunk its share count.\n\n24X plans a one-hour downtime at 7pm, while NYSE is suggesting two hours, not starting until 11.30pm. Those schedules raise some eyebrows.\n\n\u201cHow are brokers going to test their systems? In the wee hours? We\u2019d potentially be making thousands of market participants adjust to being able to work in the middle of the night and also work very quickly,\u201d says Healthy Markets\u2019 Gellasch.\n\nMost of the questions industry insiders are asking do not yet have definitive answers.\n\nThey can seem outsized too, given that more than 80 per cent of trading today, despite the pre- and post-market sessions, is still done within the regular New York market hours of 9.30am to 4pm \u2014\u00a0and no one expects an imminent, sustained boom in back-of-the-clock dealing.\n\nBut the discussions keep growing. The merits, or otherwise, of 24-hour trading often produce the liveliest debates at industry conferences around the US. They veer between a sense of inevitability and questioning the need for an overnight session at all. Privately, many traders are worried about the knock-on effect on their personal lives if trading hours get longer.\n\nThose already trading overnight are busy building ties with Asian brokers. Blue Ocean is opening a second Asia office in South Korea less than a year after its first in Tokyo. And on a trip this month to the region, 24X executives said they were overwhelmed with meeting requests.\n\n\u201cAsian retail investors have a very aggressive investing style and they want to trade Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla in their daytime and we\u2019re going to be well positioned to capture that,\u201d says Dmitri Galinov, chief executive of 24X. \u201cAs volumes rise, institutions will come in.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, more big US names are being drawn to trading out of hours. In November, Charles Schwab, the largest US broker, boasting $10tn in client assets, began offering overnight trading in more than 500 stocks and ETFs to its most active trader clients, up from 24 ETFs previously.\n\n\u201cOvernight trading has developed to the point we felt we could expand our offer,\u201d says James Kostulias, head of trading services at Charles Schwab. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new discussion by any means but it is now a reality.\u201d", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f711e768-5655-4c98-93bc-c83a8eab6c20"}, {"uuid4": "69e58251-34c7-4eb7-bcdf-2d9a62a1fb05", "title": "Former national security adviser Jake Sullivan: \u2018The core engines of American power are humming\u2019", "description": "The Biden administration official on leaving Trump with a \u2018strong hand\u2019, export controls on AI chips \u2014 and why war with China is not inevitable \u00a0", "author": "Demetri Sevastopulo", "published_date": "2025-01-31T12:30:44.951Z", "content": "When Jake Sullivan enters the private room at Rasika West End, I joke with the former US national security adviser that I would have dressed down had I known he would be casual. \u201cSmart casual,\u201d he corrects me with a smile.\n\nSullivan has picked a modern Indian restaurant just blocks from where he has lived in Washington for the past four years with his wife Maggie Goodlander, the newly elected congresswoman from New Hampshire. \u201cThis was kind of a date place,\u201d he says, making me feel slightly like an imposter.\n\nJudging by the lack of commotion, you would not realise my guest had just spent four years at the heart of the White House, dealing with a Chinese spy balloon, nuclear threats from Russian president Vladimir Putin and conflicts across the Middle East. The 48-year-old was also the lead architect of what he described as a \u201cnew Washington consensus\u201d that fused economic and national security policies, driven by his view that America needed a \u201cforeign policy for the middle class\u201d.\n\nBefore we pivot to more serious issues, I have a sensitive question. Who is more Irish, Jake Sullivan or Joe Biden?\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going on number of times asserting Irishness in life, Joe Biden beats me,\u201d he says playfully, before noting that Biden, who generally only touts his Irish background, also has French and English roots. \u201cI am mostly, if not entirely, Irish,\u201d he continues, before delivering the killer blow: \u201c[The name] Biden, I think, is English.\u201d\n\nOur waitress is hovering. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna get the chicken tikka masala,\u201d he says. I order tandoori duck makani.\n\nThe wallpaper in the room depicts monkeys smoking cigars and drinking vodka, which makes his pitch for sparkling water disappointing. I twist his arm \u2014 with minimal effort. \u201cDay drinking,\u201d he laughs, and orders an Italian Valpolicella Ripasso.\n\nI want to ask about November 5, when Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump but Sullivan\u2019s wife was elected to Congress. How did he feel about losing the White House? \u201cHonestly, that night, it didn\u2019t fully sink in. I was so excited for Maggie,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a wonderful night, and then a harder morning.\u201d\n\nMonths earlier, there was another difficult moment when Biden had a catastrophic debate against Trump. Was Sullivan, a former university champion debater, surprised, or had there been signs that Biden was slipping? \u201cI had not seen that coming, flat out had not seen it,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought it was going to be a seismic event in the campaign.\u201d\n\nCritics argue that Biden\u2019s closest aides must have realised that he was slowing mentally. But Sullivan insists that he was taken by complete surprise. \u201cIt was not at all consistent with my experience.\u201d\n\nAs our wine arrives, I ask if he has started to think about why the Democrats lost the White House. \u201cI\u2019ve started to, but not nearly as much as I did in 2016. On November 9 2016, I was unemployed on my couch and could just sit and think about it indefinitely,\u201d he says.\n\nHe thinks the outcome of the 2016 election was \u201cdeeply structural\u201d and marked a \u201cdelayed reckoning of the 2008 financial crisis and a deep wellspring of anger among the American people that the system had failed them\u201d.\u00a0\u201c[2024] may just be one of those elections where you have a Democrat running against a Republican at a time of high prices and anti-incumbent global sentiment and the Republican narrowly beat the Democrat and it\u2019s not really about something existential,\u201d he says. \u201cOr maybe it will bear out that it\u2019s something more existential.\u201d\n\nSwitching to his time in the White House, I ask what he regards as his biggest accomplishment. He says he is proud to have helped create a situation where the \u201ccore engines of American power are humming\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur alliances are stronger than they\u2019ve been in a very long time. Our competitors and adversaries are weaker too in ways that have defied expectations, certainly with China. And we\u2019ve produced that very strong American hand without getting entangled in war overseas,\u201d he argues.\n\nHe continues by saying that the domestic investment in chips and export controls on AI-related chips, coupled with efforts to boost the defence industrial base and diversify supply chains, marked a new approach to policy. But he stresses that it is a \u201cgenerational project\u201d that he hopes the Trump administration will adopt and build on.\n\nChina policy, he adds, was another achievement. \u201cAmerica is in a demonstrably better position in the long-term competition with China than we were, and yet we did it while stabilising the relationship and finding areas to work together.\u201d\n\nHe says the US and China are in a \u201cdecisive decade\u201d that will determine which comes out ahead in key areas such as artificial intelligence and the transition to a clean energy economy. \u201cFour out of those 10 years in the decisive decade\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[have] turned in America\u2019s favour in a really significant way,\u201d says Sullivan, adding that the export controls the US imposed on high-end chips and manufacturing equipment have had a \u201cdemonstrable impact\u201d.\n\nDays after our lunch, a Chinese company called DeepSeek stunned Silicon Valley by unveiling an AI model that appears to rival US models. After the news broke, I emailed Sullivan to get his reaction. He says it shows that the US needs to \u201cstay on our game\u201d but he is \u201cstill confident in the American lead\u201d in AI. He stresses that it \u201conly reinforces\u201d his view on the importance of export controls.\n\nAnother critical area in the decisive decade is US deterrence in the face of what Sullivan describes as the \u201clargest peacetime military build-up in human history\u201d being undertaken by China. The US boosted deterrence by bolstering its alliances and urging allies to work more closely with each other, Sullivan says. He adds that Aukus \u2014 the US-UK-Australia agreement to enable Canberra to procure nuclear-powered submarines \u2014 was a \u201chuge deal\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strategic marriage between the United States and Australia for half a century,\u201d he says.\n\nAs our dishes arrive, Sullivan says his biggest regret is how the US handled its withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, which led to the deaths of 13 members of the American military. He says the administration had decided that pulling out too rapidly could destroy morale in Kabul and lead to the collapse of the Afghan government \u2014 but it ended up falling anyway.\n\n\u201cA lesson learned from that is, if there are risks associated with an evacuation, just move out early, even if it comes with some friction with the host government,\u201d says Sullivan.\n\nOver four years, he dealt with multiple crises involving China, including its 2021 hypersonic missile test, its huge military exercises in response to then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s trip to Taiwan in 2022, and the Chinese spy balloon that flew over the US in 2023. Which stands out in his mind?\n\nHe cites the spy balloon saga, which followed the \u201cextreme tensions\u201d sparked by Pelosi\u2019s Taiwan visit. \u201cIt felt like we were in a very deep hole, but something more than that. It felt like, in living colour, the risk of a downward spiral in the US-China relationship was not merely abstract. This could go bad.\u201d\n\nI am still puzzled as to whether China intentionally flew the balloon over the US, or if it was blown off course by weather. He says it is hard to say without veering into classified areas, but drops a hint. \u201cYou can find Biden comments publicly\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009where his personal opinion was that this was not intentional,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll say.\u201d\n\nA more recent espionage case is a months-long Chinese hacking attack against US telecoms networks called \u201cSalt Typhoon\u201d. \u201cWhat makes Salt Typhoon unique is the sheer scale of access,\u201d he says about the ongoing attack. \u201cThey weren\u2019t just going into a senior government official\u2019s phone. They were going into the major American telecommunications companies, Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, and picking any phone they wanted to listen to.\u201d\n\nSullivan says a critical question is whether US telecoms companies remain \u201chighly vulnerable\u201d to hacking from China. \u201cI would say right now, today, they are,\u201d he warns.\n\nI suddenly realise I have been attacking the plain naan that Sullivan ordered and not my garlic naan. But we are focused more on the conversation than our curries, so I hope he has not noticed.\n\nI want to return to the critical issue of Taiwan. Was there ever a time when he worried that Washington and Beijing were heading towards some kind of military conflict?\n\n\u201cBeijing began to develop a perception that the direction of American policy on Taiwan was inexorably toward the end of the status quo,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIf Beijing became convinced there\u2019s only one way to stop Taiwan independence, and it\u2019s grab Taiwan or bomb Taiwan, they would do it,\u201d he warns.\n\nAs a result, it was critical to send a \u201cvery clear message of deterrence\u201d while making clear at the same time that Washington was not trying to upend the status quo.\n\n\u201cThe US and China have kept this delicate balance for decades,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just need to practise a disciplined approach that sustains that out into the future. If we do\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we can sustain it. I do not believe war is inevitable.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Biden made a big bet on India by deepening technology and security co-operation. As Sullivan touts their achievements \u2014 starting with how Biden elevated the Quad grouping of the US, India, Japan and Australia \u2014 our waitress removes his plate. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done very much damage,\u201d I quip. \u201cI\u2019m a light eater,\u201d he says.\n\nThe goal of closer ties with India, I suggest, was not helped by the assassination of a Sikh separatist in Vancouver and a thwarted assassination plot in New York, both suspected of having links to Indian intelligence. Under pressure from the US, New Delhi launched an investigation that remains open after more than a year. Sullivan says it is important to get answers. \u201cI hope the Trump administration will keep pressing.\u201d\n\nI ask how he evaluates the situation in Ukraine. \u201cThe question is, can the current administration display sufficient staying power that Putin sees we\u2019re going to hang in there and the costs are going to continue to mount?\u201d he says. \u201cIn which case, I do believe there\u2019s a deal to be done.\u201d\n\nJust before our lunch, Trump had threatened to hit Russia with more tariffs and sanctions if there was no agreement to end the war, which Sullivan says was a \u201cgood\u201d move.\n\nBiden came under criticism for not providing certain weapons systems, including F-16 fighter jets, as quickly as requested by Kyiv. Sullivan pushes back. Biden approved F-16 transfers in May 2023, but the Ukrainian air force has only 18 jets because, Sullivan explains, it has only 16 pilots trained to fly the sophisticated fighters.\n\nAfter he orders mint tea and I ask for a coffee, Sullivan presses home his point. \u201cThe conventional wisdom that we did too little too late, and if only we had given this weapons system at this time rather than that time something would be dramatically different in the war, is not borne out by any serious review of the evidence,\u201d he says.\n\nWe move on to Iran. Sullivan thinks the regime in Tehran is weaker than at any time since the Iran-Iraq war, which ended in 1988. How does he expect Trump to handle the issue? \u201cI predict a robust debate in this administration between an audacious diplomatic play and an audacious military play,\u201d he responds, prompting me to ask whether he thinks Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be tempted to launch a military strike.\n\n\u201cWithout personalising it to Netanyahu, I would say the senior leadership of Israel, both political and military as well as intelligence, will be sorely tempted to take advantage of this moment.\u201d\n\nI ask about Gaza and whether he believes the Biden administration had the right balance amid criticism that it did not put enough pressure on Netanyahu to stop the killing of civilians.\n\n\u201cThere was immense human suffering in Gaza, and so for me to sit here and say, \u2018No, no, it all went great,\u2019 would display a total lack of human empathy. On the other hand, the idea of cutting weapons off from Israel when they were taking incoming from several fronts all at once\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I\u2019m not sure how I could have justified that. So, it\u2019s hard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the single biggest thing in the four years where only some level of perspective gained over time will allow me to fully judge what I thought we did right and what I thought we didn\u2019t do right.\u201d\n\nWe have been talking for well over two hours. Putting policy questions aside, I want to learn more about the man before our time is up.\n\nAfter four intense years with less than two weeks of vacation, Sullivan\u2019s immediate plans do not involve work. He is flying to Utah to go skiing with friends the next day and is planning a guys\u2019 hiking trip to the Grand Canyon and Horseshoe Bend in Arizona.\n\nHe is also looking forward to reading books after having almost no time in the White House beyond a little \u201cescapist\u201d reading. He played soccer in high school and raves about The Club by Jonathan Clegg and Joshua Robinson, about the Premier League. His interest in English football stems from his time at Oxford university, when he started following Chelsea.\n\nSo, what is next, I ask? His response is refreshingly honest in a city where people are constantly posturing. \u201cThis is a heavy answer,\u201d he starts. \u201cMaggie and I have been over the course of these four years\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009trying to start a family and had some great difficulties,\u201d he continues, referring to a traumatic miscarriage his wife suffered. \u201cMy full-time job is to figure out how we could do that,\u201d Sullivan tells me. \u201cMaybe adoption.\u201d\n\nThey have a house in New Hampshire, which they believe would be a good state in which to raise kids. Sullivan is contemplating taking a position teaching at a university in Boston, which would only be a 45-minute commute.\n\nThe restaurant has almost emptied. As he is about to leave, he says half-jokingly about our lunch interview that he will read it with \u201cgreat anxiety\u201d.\n\nI realise I didn\u2019t notice if he finished his wine. \u201cI believe I did,\u201d he says to my relief. Earlier, I had told him that \u2014 as an Irish citizen \u2014 I would get in trouble with Ireland\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Geraldine Byrne Nason, if I failed to convince the proud Irish-American to have a drink.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m out of work now, so I\u2019m entitled to a glass,\u201d Sullivan quips before heading out into the bitter cold.\n\nDemetri Sevastopulo is the FT\u2019s US-China correspondent\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fae9c36a-99fd-45e7-94ff-2706f838ddcf"}, {"uuid4": "841e8189-792a-4cfe-8b4f-da84e4d66a6c", "title": "How undercounting immigration skews narratives", "description": "The US and UK have been underestimating population growth but with diverging implications", "author": "John Burn-Murdoch", "published_date": "2025-01-31T05:00:44.845Z", "content": "A curious thing is likely to happen next week: Donald Trump may well be handed positive headlines as a result of record-high immigration. Perhaps more curious still, a similar phenomenon in the UK is instead giving Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves a headache.\n\nIn both cases, the narrative is being shaped by how labour market statistics deal with the revelation that the population is larger than was previously realised. But this plays out in different ways on the two sides of the Atlantic.\n\nLast quarter, Britain\u2019s Office for National Statistics revised upward its estimates of net immigration during the two years ending in December 2023, calculating that around 300,000 more people than initially thought arrived and stayed in the UK, a 20 per cent bump. This increase, as well as some of the updated assumptions beneath the surface, fed into revised population projections published earlier this week.\n\nIf that sounds like a big adjustment, the US Census Bureau then increased its estimates of net immigration for 2022 and 2023 by almost 90 per cent, from 2.1mn to 4mn, adding another 2.8mn for 2024. As a result, US population growth last year is now thought to have been the fastest in decades.\n\nTo be clear: the fact that these revisions happen is a good thing. In both cases, the way immigration is counted is improving, aided in large part by the incorporation of administrative data, which is more accurate and timely than survey-based sources. At any rate, it\u2019s far better to have revisions and more accurate numbers, than no revisions and still the wrong numbers.\n\nBut substantial shifts like these don\u2019t just change what we thought we knew about population size and growth rates. They influence economic indicators too, not least labour market statistics.\n\nNext Friday\u2019s monthly US jobs report, the first of Trump\u2019s second term, will incorporate a raft of revisions to the underlying survey data, among them the dramatic upward adjustment to the population size.\n\nAnalyses from the Brookings Institution and Jed Kolko, formerly a senior economist under Joe Biden, indicate that, contrary to reports last year, the new figures will probably show that native-born Americans are not losing out in the job market relative to immigrants. In fact, US-born employment is growing.\n\nThe old, erroneously low population figures artificially lowered estimated employment levels derived from America\u2019s main household economic survey, causing US-born employment to appear to be falling. In reality, population growth was so high that even though the native-born share had fallen, the native-born number still rose.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, similar revisions have a very different impact. Well-publicised problems with Britain\u2019s labour force survey mean the UK increasingly leans on administrative data to take the temperature of the labour market. And that shows that the number of working-age payrolled employees flatlined for most of last year, before dipping.\n\nCrucially, because these figures are counts based on tax records, not proportions derived from surveys, unexpectedly high population numbers only grow the denominator in the employment rate, not both sides of the equation as in the US. As a result, stagnant UK job numbers translate into a marked deterioration in labour market conditions when viewed against the backdrop of robust immigration-driven population growth.\n\nThe number of working-age UK employees is down 0.2 percentage points year-on-year, but expressed as a proportion of the population the dip is almost a full percentage point \u2014 the deepest since 2008, pandemic aside. Where the rapid labour market loosening of 2008 was mainly driven by a shrinking numerator (job losses), this one comes primarily from an expanding denominator (possibly inflated by jobless arrivals).\n\nThe depth of this downturn is probably a lower bound, since some recent arrivals may be self-employed or in other types of employment that the UK\u2019s tax-based job figures struggle to capture. But the general picture of population growth outpacing job growth is clear.\n\nWhile statistics like the numbers of people and workers in the country might feel solid, the array of revisions and methodological differences highlight the flimsy nature of many narratives that form around them. The picture gets more accurate over time, but there will be blurry moments along the way.\n\njohn.burn-murdoch@ft.com, @jburnmurdoch", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/522d896b-d949-4676-a15c-0d4bff215062"}, {"uuid4": "171c06cc-fab8-462d-85fe-196d2a000984", "title": "Trump has made a good start", "description": "A series of early moves has breathed fresh life into the business community", "author": "Michael Strain", "published_date": "2025-01-31T05:00:44.844Z", "content": "The writer is director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute\n\nWall Street\u2019s confidence in US technological leadership was shaken this week with the unveiling of DeepSeek\u2019s latest artificial intelligence model. The Chinese start-up seemed to come out of nowhere.\n\nThis episode should highlight the wisdom of President Donald Trump\u2019s approach to AI. His executive order on the technology is admirably clear: \u201cIt is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America\u2019s global AI dominance.\u201d\u00a0He revoked the policies of the Biden administration, which were \u201cto advance and govern the development and use of AI\u201d in accordance with several goals, including \u201cadvancing equity\u201d and ensuring that AI does not \u201cworsen job quality\u201d or cause \u201charmful labour-force disruptions\u201d.\n\nI am glad to have a president who prioritises AI\u2019s importance to economic prosperity and national security. And this is not the only good move by Trump among the blitz of activity since his inauguration.\n\nHis efforts to deregulate the energy sector and to expand geothermal and nuclear energy production are similarly laudable. They will increase the reliability of electricity supply and reduce energy costs for households and businesses. The new president has already reversed Biden\u2019s foolish pause on new export permits for liquefied natural gas.\n\nMeanwhile, ending Lina Khan\u2019s reign as head of the nation\u2019s antitrust enforcement agency has breathed new life into the business community.\n\nAll this is unleashing animal spirits \u2014 and not just among top bankers and chief executives. Sentiment is surging on Main Street as well.\u00a0In December, the National Federation of Independent Businesses\u2019 small business survey recorded the largest monthly increase since 1983 in the net percentage of companies expecting the economy to improve. This positive sentiment could translate into expansion, innovation and investment, quickening productivity growth and increasing wages.\n\nElsewhere, the new Department of Government Efficiency should be applauded for attempting to increase the efficiency of the federal government.\u00a0Ronald Reagan remarked that \u201ca government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we\u2019ll ever see on this earth\u201d. He made that observation in 1964. Since then, federal government spending as a share of annual GDP has grown by more than 30 per cent. If Doge is able to work with Congress to prove Reagan wrong, all the better.\n\nPublic sector employees hold positions of public trust, and some of Trump\u2019s efforts to hold government workers to higher performance standards are to be welcomed. For example, the vast majority of them should be expected to go to work in their offices five days per week, where they will be most productive and able to generate the highest return on taxpayers\u2019 dollars.\n\nTrump has a different approach on tax, too. The Biden administration wanted to sign up to an international corporate tax cartel, known as Pillar Two, in order to keep other nations from reducing business taxes. Trump wants to further reduce corporate taxes in the US. I\u2019m with him.\n\nThe president was also right to halt the disbursement of $300bn in green energy funding. It would be better to use those funds to finance business tax cuts like full expensing, which would increase investment, productivity and wages.\n\nTrump has been president for less than two weeks, and the ultimate success or failure of all of these initiatives will depend on their specific design, implementation and execution.\u00a0This is especially true of immigration. Deporting, say, 200,000 illegal immigrants this year who have committed serious crimes would be good for the nation. But attempting to deport, say, 2mn illegal immigrants in 2025 would hurt workers, businesses and communities.\n\nSimilarly, if done properly, efforts to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion schemes could increase focus on merit and reduce racial discrimination in the job market. But they could also exacerbate discrimination if handled poorly.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty about the new administration to criticise, to be sure. For example, Trump\u2019s decision to pardon violent January 6 insurrectionists was appalling. On economics, among other examples, his threats to increase tariffs on America\u2019s allies could reduce business investment and weaken international alliances. And he is likely to continue to refuse to cut Medicare and social security spending, which is driving the nation\u2019s unsustainable fiscal trajectory.\n\nBut the president\u2019s critics won\u2019t do themselves any favours by not being open to the good things his administration will do \u2014 and has already done.", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/16ab6569-1719-4b1a-8efb-0790b9f93948"}, {"uuid4": "f61be127-9e8e-4dc3-92df-c723b96b74fe", "title": "The threat to Aids sufferers shows how far the Republicans have fallen", "description": "An African aid programme created by George W Bush is casually being endangered by Donald Trump", "author": "Alan Beattie", "published_date": "2025-01-30T11:14:44.000Z", "content": "Ten days into the Trump administration, it\u2019s hard to say which is worse \u2014 the targeted spreading of fear by raids on immigrant workers and native Americans or the wanton destruction caused by the casual suspension of foreign aid. Earlier this week, secretary of state Marco Rubio had to rush to issue an emergency temporary reprieve to the 20mn people, including half a million children, currently being kept alive by antiretroviral drugs under the US Pepfar (President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief) programme, principally in Africa. The edict suspending foreign aid had reportedly already caused some Aids sufferers to be denied drugs, and Pepfar\u2019s future remains uncertain.\n\nPepfar has helped turn a pandemic engulfing much of the continent into just another public health problem to be managed. It\u2019s striking that its creator was George W Bush, like Trump a conservative president who otherwise diminished the US\u2019s reputation abroad and trashed its fiscal probity at home.\n\nThe standard view of acts such as cutting aid is that they are foolish even on the basis of hard-headed self-interest because they diminish the US\u2019s soft power abroad. That\u2019s possibly true, but Pepfar and the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), a separate aid programme set up around the same time by Bush, were not simply crude attempts to buy influence. They proved a genuine good-faith break with decades of cynical American aid that had kept foreign policy clients like Pakistan and Egypt in the US camp but did little to make lives there better off.\n\nAs a reporter then covering aid and development in Washington, it took me some time, amid the administration\u2019s dissembling over the Iraq war and much else, to realise that the Bush aid initiatives were for real. After a while it became obvious and even occasionally amusing that the US was earnestly inventing aid programmes as it went along. The MCA was triumphantly announced ahead of a UN development summit in Mexico in 2002 and then had to be \u201cclarified\u201d a few days later to reveal that the budget was twice as big as first claimed. The rather endearing story at the time was that the White House had simply misunderstood its own numbers.\n\nBush announced Pepfar in a State of the Union speech in 2003, saying it would replicate in other African countries the successful Ugandan model of administering antiretrovirals (ARVs) through a network of medical centre hubs with satellite distribution units. Leaving aside the irony of the Bush administration encouraging a socialist model of centralised public healthcare, the plan again had to be somewhat changed \u2014 one of the main architects being the immunologist Anthony Fauci of Covid pandemic fame \u2014 after it turned out most recipient countries didn\u2019t actually have Uganda\u2019s institutional set-up.\n\nBut Pepfar not only worked, it also challenged development orthodoxy. Rather than painstakingly building systems of public finance and healthcare, it hurled money at a specific problem and got results. It was widely believed mass ARV therapy would not be possible. Pepfar showed it was. The US also overcame its intrinsic suspicion of multilateral initiatives and led the financing of a new \u201cGlobal Fund\u201d to combat Aids, tuberculosis and malaria set up in 2002. Credible estimates are that Pepfar has saved 26mn lives.\n\nThe lobbying that overcame the traditional visceral US resistance to foreign aid also managed to unearth hitherto unsuspected reserves of compassion on Capitol Hill, often linked to religiosity. At the time, I spoke to Republican lawmakers who seemed to have only the sketchiest idea about how development aid worked but had received visits from the rock star Bono, trusted him and were accordingly prepared to spend taxpayers\u2019 money to help Africa.\n\nRemarkably, Bono persuaded North Carolina senator Jesse Helms, the hardline conservative Republican who used to talk about aid going down foreign \u201cratholes\u201d, to fund debt relief and HIV-Aids treatment in developing countries. Helms was won over in particular by the plight of babies born with HIV who were indisputably innocent victims. The general tactic of seeding every development campaign with an emoting celebrity has become tedious, but this was impressive work.\n\nBut the aid programmes weren\u2019t part of a general internationalist mindset. The Republican isolationist tradition remained strong \u2014 and was exploited by Trump with regard to Bush\u2019s Iraq war during campaigning for the presidential nomination in 2016. In fact, Bush himself allowed Iraq to slide into chaos after the disastrous invasion. He was fundamentally not a nation-builder.\n\nThe global Doha round of trade talks in effect collapsed during Bush\u2019s administration, as the US (along with other countries) was not prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to get it to work. Despite Pepfar, US relative influence in Africa continued to diminish, as it had since the end of the cold war. The 2000s was the decade when the Chinese rather than the American footprint expanded over the continent.\n\nPepfar and the other aid programmes simply reflected a moment when campaigners managed to mine a vein of decency in a Republican administration and among lawmakers on Capitol Hill. The fact that it was threatened with casual destruction this week shows how far decency has leached from the White House. If it still exists among Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s hiding very effectively. The world has become darker for it.\n\nalan.beattie@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88b3b032-26b2-40a2-b892-89ab7fadfc01"}, {"uuid4": "e172230d-9fc0-4ff5-8caf-44cc06e54326", "title": "The global AI race: Is China catching up to the US?", "description": "The release of DeepSeek\u2019s new model has shaken assumptions about who has the upper hand in developing the technology ", "author": "Richard Waters", "published_date": "2025-01-31T19:14:33.581Z", "content": "On Monday, the world watched as $1tn was wiped off the stock market in a single day, a huge bonfire kindled by the little-known Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek.\n\nIts release of a new AI model, known as R1, upended assumptions about US supremacy in AI and raised the prospect that some in China are learning how to beat Silicon Valley at its own game.\n\nThe model can \u201creason\u201d to solve complex scientific problems and performs at par with leading-edge software from US tech giants, but was apparently developed at a fraction of the price of those models.\n\nIt quickly dislodged OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the US iOS App store.\n\nAlongside the geopolitical challenge, DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough has dual implications for the tech industry. Firstly, it is likely to accelerate the commercial development and uptake of AI, much as ChatGPT did in 2022.\n\nAt the same time, it threatens to demolish investment assumptions that have underpinned the entire US stock market, by seeming to show that developing advanced AI models does not require vast amounts of infrastructure and thus capital.\n\nThe question being asked with sudden urgency from California to Wall Street: Has China caught up in AI at just the moment that many working in the field claim they are on the brink of a historic breakthrough that will put machines on a par with human-level intelligence \u2014 a threshold known as artificial general intelligence?\n\n\u201c[DeepSeek\u2019s] algorithmic innovations remind us that China and the US are neck and neck and that our technological edge isn\u2019t guaranteed, pushing our industry to make AI more efficient,\u201d says Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive and chair of Google.\n\n\u201cTo get to AGI first, we\u2019ll need to continue to invest in talent, support our vibrant open-source ecosystem, and ensure we out-innovate, not just outspend, our competitors.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek was founded on Silicon Valley-style levels of ambition. It started out in 2023 as a side project for the eccentric hedge fund billionaire Liang Wenfeng, just as the race to replicate ChatGPT was heating up. It has since turned into one of China\u2019s leading AI labs.\n\n\u201cWhy is Silicon Valley so innovative? Because they dare to do things,\u201d Liang said in an interview last year. \u201cWhen ChatGPT came out, the tech community in China lacked confidence in frontier innovation.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cFrom investors to [Chinese] big tech, they all thought that the gap was too big and opted to focus on applications instead. But innovation starts with confidence.\u201d\n\nAs state-owned funds in China have taken on a larger role funding start-ups in the past few years, the entrepreneurial ecosystem has felt pressured to guarantee returns for fear of losing the country\u2019s assets.\n\nDeepSeek is distinctive among Chinese generative AI start-ups in that it has not raised any external financing and has therefore been free from these constraints.\n\nA pure research lab, echoing the early days of DeepMind in the UK and OpenAI in the US, DeepSeek has focused all its effort on pushing the field of AI forward, rather than trying to make money. And even though it prides itself on being entirely founded on homegrown talent, it has adopted a culture often found in the US tech heartland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unique among Chinese AI companies,\u201d says an AI investor in China. \u201cThere is no politics or management friction like at the other big tech companies or larger start-ups. People don\u2019t have specific titles or reporting lines.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s origins as a quantitative hedge fund meant it had engineering talent with a deep understanding of chips. Its breakthrough turned on its apparent success at training advanced AI models without spending the hundreds of millions of dollars its US rivals have.\n\nIt claimed that the final training step for R1 cost only $5.6mn. The figure, however, doesn\u2019t include many other costs involved in developing its models, including computing infrastructure and previous training runs, making it hard to draw precise comparisons.\n\nIt may also have cut corners to save costs: OpenAI claims to have evidence that DeepSeek trained on the output from OpenAI\u2019s own models \u2014 not something allowed under its terms of use, though an underhand practice thought to be widely used by US companies as well.\n\nIronically, Washington\u2019s attempt to hamper China\u2019s AI sector by imposing export controls on high-end US chips from 2022 onwards may have contributed to DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough.\n\nWithout access to leading-edge silicon, the company was forced to find innovative ways to squeeze higher performance out of the less sophisticated chips it was able to buy.\n\nThe company\u2019s claims about the low cost and advanced capabilities of its models have touched off a heated debate about how disruptive the company will turn out to be. Silicon Valley\u2019s leaders have paid tribute to its innovations, while also playing down their significance.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the R1 model \u201cimpressive\u201d, while Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Meta, credited the company with making \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems\u201d.\n\nYet Zuckerberg also cast DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough as just one among many in a field that is moving at breakneck speed, making it hard to tell how deeply its low-cost approach would change the dynamics of the industry, he said.\n\nAccording to some China tech watchers, DeepSeek\u2019s advances aren\u2019t significant enough to change the fact that the country\u2019s AI companies have been fast followers, largely devoted to emulating their US counterparts rather than setting the direction themselves.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek\u2019s work falls into that category. What would really turn the tables in US-China competition is if they built something that actually pushed the frontier. We\u2019ll see if they get there,\u201d says Helen Toner, an AI policy analyst at Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, and a former board member at OpenAI.\n\nYet others say that the fact that a Chinese tech start-up has been behind the latest head-turning advance represents a watershed moment, changing the dynamic in the AI race between the two countries.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek\u2019s latest models may not mean that China is pulling ahead of the US in the AI race, but it does prove that Chinese companies are making remarkable strides in software innovation that mitigate the constraints imposed by US export controls,\u201d wrote Tilly Zhang, a China tech analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, a China-focused research firm, in a note published this week.\n\n\u201cThe race for AI leadership is no longer just about who has access to the best chips, but about who puts them to best use.\u201d\n\nWhile the significance of DeepSeek\u2019s technical breakthroughs is a matter of debate, there is no mistaking the shockwave that passed through the stock market as investors digested the implications of its main innovation: dramatically cutting the cost of training for the most advanced AI models.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s models appear to undermine the argument that US AI companies have made vociferously over the past year: that AI advances require vast amounts of capital and infrastructure to develop and deploy their technology at scale.\n\nInstead, they suggest that far more expensive, US-developed models would have little to differentiate them, raising fears among investors of a sharp deflationary shock.\n\n\u201cThere was a sense of American exceptionalism \u2014 that only America had this technology, and only Americans had the money to do this,\u201d says Jim Tierney, a US growth stock investor at AllianceBernstein. \u201cThe commoditisation of these models is happening much faster than we thought.\u201d\n\nMuch of Silicon Valley fell back on the argument that others in the industry will quickly copy DeepSeek\u2019s innovations, bringing down the cost of training AI models across the board. Executives like Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella claimed it will make the technology more affordable for customers and boost its use \u2014 something that would benefit the entire industry.\n\nIn a sign of the company\u2019s confidence in its status, DeepSeek has published its research and released its models in \u201copen-weights\u201d form, a more limited version of open-source software that allows anyone to download, use and modify the technology.\n\nThe move will attract a wide international following among software developers looking for \u201copen\u201d models to build applications on. Most models developed by Silicon Valley\u2019s leading AI companies remain closed, though there are exceptions \u2014 notably Meta, whose open models have surged in popularity.\n\nBut Deepseek\u2019s model is accessible at a far lower cost. The Chinese company says it charges only 1.4 cents for each 1mn tokens it generates \u2014 roughly equivalent to 700,000 words. By contrast, Meta charges $2.80 for the same output from its largest models.\n\n\u201cA whole number of developers are experimenting with what\u2019s now a Chinese open source AI-based solution,\u201d says Keegan McBride, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute who focuses on the geopolitics of AI. \u201cIt really shows that in the AI space, the US isn\u2019t the only option on the table.\u201d\n\nWhile Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, described DeepSeek in glowing terms as proof that \u201copen-source models are surpassing proprietary ones\u201d, the start-up nonetheless poses a direct challenge to Meta.\n\nThe company\u2019s \u201cclaim to fame has been creating open-weight models that aren\u2019t too far behind the bleeding edge, and DeepSeek just beat them at their own game,\u201d says Toner.\n\nBeyond Deepseek\u2019s impact on the market for AI products, its breakthrough also promises to have geopolitical repercussions, coming at what many believe is a pivotal moment in the competition between the US and China for AI supremacy.\n\nIf R1 and its successors become the global standard for \u201copen\u201d AI models, it would handicap the US, warned Meta\u2019s Zuckerberg. \u201cFor our national advantage, it\u2019s important that it\u2019s an American standard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to build the AI system that people around the world are using.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek has \u201caccelerated the urgency for people in every country to assess\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the technological balance of power emerging between various countries,\u201d says Craig Mundie, a Microsoft veteran and former White House adviser, who counsels OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman on tech policy and strategy.\n\nIf China has managed to get on to an equal footing with the US on AI, it has implications for everything that the technology could eventually be used for, warned Dario Amodei, CEO of US AI start-up Anthropic.\n\n\u201cIt seems likely that China could direct more talent, capital and focus to military applications of the technology,\u201d Amodei wrote of DeepSeek\u2019s advances. \u201cCombined with its large industrial base and military-strategic advantages, this could help China take a commanding lead on the global stage, not just for AI but for everything.\u201d\n\nMundie, who also chairs the US-China AI Dialogue diplomatic forum established by the late US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, pointed out that AI was the \u201cultimate dual use technology\u201d, meaning it has both positive and dangerous purposes.\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek is likely to hang over discussions when the diplomatic group convenes within the next 90 days to discuss a multilateral but common safety structure for AI software, which Mundie writes about in his latest book Genesis, co-authored with Kissinger and Schmidt.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean everyone will have the same laws or rules, but [building] the architecture by which these machines grow up understanding human values and comport with societal choices everywhere in the world, I think is an urgent task,\u201d Mundie says.\n\nMeanwhile, aspiring young entrepreneurs in China are looking towards DeepSeek and its founder as inspiration to build a new generation of powerful technology.\n\nA teenager who came to pay respects at Liang\u2019s house in the village of Mililing this week says: \u201cHe is a pragmatic technologist. He put together a team that\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009surpassed those of companies like OpenAI that we couldn\u2019t compete with before. He is a great person who has made contributions to China.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Melissa Heikkila in London", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0e8d6f24-6d45-4de0-b209-8f2130341bae"}, {"uuid4": "3cb0ef1c-59b9-45fc-8548-293d32b74617", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s plan for space lasers to destroy nuclear weapons", "description": "US president orders work on defence shield going beyond Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u2018Star Wars\u2019 programme", "author": "Joe Miller", "published_date": "2025-01-30T05:00:10.856Z", "content": "Donald Trump this week ordered work on the most ambitious missile shield in US history, one designed to destroy hypersonic missiles and prevent nuclear annihilation.\n\nThe US president dubbed it the \u201cIron Dome for America\u201d \u2014 a nod to Israel\u2019s renowned air defence system.\n\nBut the vision for Trump\u2019s next-generation system, including space-based lasers, is actually much closer to Ronald Reagan\u2019s so-called Star Wars programme, launched in 1983 at the height of the cold war.\n\nDeveloping a kind of Star Wars 2.0 would cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The technological challenges it faces are immense. Nuclear experts also warned the initiative could provoke China and Russia to take countermeasures that would nullify its effects. It is partly why the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists moved its \u201cDoomsday clock\u201d one second closer to midnight this week.\n\nThe US president\u2019s executive order, signed on Monday, gives defence secretary Pete Hegseth 60 days to flesh out a plan to defend the US against ballistic, hypersonic and advanced cruise missile attack.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposed system, outlined in the memo, is comprehensive, extraordinarily expensive and a different order of technical sophistication from Israel\u2019s Iron Dome.\n\nThat system defends only small areas from short-range, low-flying and non-nuclear missiles. Trump\u2019s initiative seeks to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles that travel 100 times further and seven times faster. The US is also almost 450 times bigger than Israel.\n\nInstead, Trump\u2019s order demands the deployment of \u201cspace-based interceptors\u201d \u2014 a web of satellites, some equipped with lasers. It then calls for the development of another layer of lower-altitude interceptors if the lasers fail.\n\nIn addition, it demands \u201ccapabilities to defeat missile attacks prior to launch\u201d\u00a0\u2014 in other words, a system that destroys the archer, not just the arrow.\n\nAnalysts say that a leakproof, space-based missile shield is all but impossible. \u201cThere is no magical security blanket,\u201d said Tom Karako, a leading missile expert at the CSIS think-tank in Washington.\n\nTo detect, intercept and destroy ballistic nuclear missiles during their so- called boost phase, the three- to five-minute period before they enter orbit, would require laser beams effective over hundreds of kilometres. No such technology currently exists.\n\nIn part that is due to \u201cthermal blooming\u201d, whereby the energy from a laser heats up the atmosphere surrounding it and reduces the beam\u2019s potency. While the effect is small in the near vacuum of outer space, it is much greater once the beam hits the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nPowering the satellites that fire the lasers would also require them to have mini nuclear reactors, or perhaps an advanced system of solar panels. \u201cThat\u2019s not impossible but\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009would require a major research and investment effort that couldn\u2019t be completed in the short term,\u201d said Fabian Hoffmann, a missile expert at the Oslo Nuclear Project.\n\nThen there are costs, which Trump would need to convince Congress to fund.\n\nA 2012 report by the National Academy of Science found that \u201ceven an austere and limited-capability\u201d space-based defence system would require 650 satellites at a cost of $300bn. It also warned that it would be vulnerable to anti-satellite weapons \u2014 such as the space-based nuclear weapons that Russia has developed recently, according to US intelligence.\n\n\u201cSpace-based missile defences\u00a0have repeatedly been abandoned because they are expensive, very technically challenging and readily defeated,\u201d said Laura Grego, research director for the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nEffective technologies already exist. Ukraine has successfully used western-supplied systems \u2014 such as US-made Patriots and the German-manufactured IRIS-T \u2014 to destroy incoming Russian ballistic and hypersonic missiles.\n\nThe problem, again, is cost. The US already has a $60bn ground-based midcourse missile defence programme. This consists of 44 interceptors, deployed in Alaska and California, which are designed to knock out rogue long-range missiles from foes such as North Korea.\n\nBut as each one costs upwards of $50mn, expanding that system to cover all the US would be vastly expensive.\n\n\u201cOne cannot put active defences everywhere that would be needed to defend cities, critical infrastructure and military sites,\u201d said Stacie Pettyjohn of the Center for a New American Security think-tank.\n\nMoreover, a 2000 technical analysis\u00a0found that even a less-developed country such as North Korea could use long-understood countermeasures, such as decoys or a \u201ccooled shroud\u201d that covers the nuclear warhead to confound heat-seeking interceptor missiles.\n\n\u201cCurrent homeland missile defence systems, despite decades of development, may not even reliably counter rogue state threats,\u201d said Zhao Tong, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\u201cAchieving comprehensive defence against Russia and China\u2019s vastly larger missile arsenals would require astronomical spending without unprecedented technological breakthroughs,\u201d he added.\n\nEven a moderately successful Star Wars 2.0 would strip Russia and China of their retaliatory capability and could prompt them to embark on an accelerated arms race in order to retain nuclear parity.\n\n\u201cIf one [nuclear power] can show it can defend itself while also having first- strike capability [for its nuclear weapons], that is destabilising,\u201d said Manpreet Sethi, head of the nuclear programme at the Centre for Air Power Studies in New Delhi.\n\n\u201cIt is an offensive threat that major power rivals cannot and will not ignore,\u201d said Eric Heginbotham, an expert on Chinese nuclear issues at MIT. \u201cOur\u00a0intent may be defensive\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but whatever the intent, if the capabilities are real, this will be regarded as a critical offensive threat.\u201d\n\nAdversaries could then take easily available countermeasures. Russia, for example, could load more nuclear warheads on existing ballistic missiles, or target areas with weaker defences.\n\n\u201cAdversaries could simply redirect attacks to numerous unprotected population centres \u2014 rendering the defence of select locations strategically meaningless,\u201d Zhao said.\n\nAnalysts argued that a more sober approach would involve the US working to limit countries\u2019 strategic nuclear arsenals \u2014 something Trump backed in a recent speech at Davos.\n\nConventional missile threats could meanwhile be addressed by beefing up lower-altitude systems, based on the ground or US naval ships. The cost would still be huge, but such an approach would be technically feasible and potentially avoid another arms race.\n\n\u201cThe US should focus on strengthening lower-layer missile defences while striving to maintain the current balance of power in the nuclear domain,\u201d Hoffmann said.\n\nThe space-based part of the programme would require hundreds\u00a0of carrier satellites to be launched \u2014 a market currently dominated by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\nAlthough the US government has other contractors capable of sending carrier satellites into space, Musk\u2019s rockets have a higher payload capacity, higher payload volume and are substantially cheaper than most competitors. They\u00a0are also being launched at much greater\u00a0frequency, with one launch on average every three days last year.\n\n\u201cA lot of people stand to make money,\u201d said Grego of the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nThere would be trade-offs, however. SpaceX already has $20bn worth of government\u00a0contracts and would probably have to sacrifice capacity reserved for populating its Starlink constellation \u2014 the company\u2019s biggest revenue driver.\n\nAll this assumes the space-based programme, which Grego described as a \u201cfantasy\u201d, will be approved by Congress and goes ahead.\n\nCartography by Steven Bernard", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/62c01967-0100-46ee-9f4f-e9af467d7604"}, {"uuid4": "4fef8fc2-1c91-4307-9541-900c739d93bc", "title": "With DeepSeek, China innovates and the US imitates ", "description": "The start-up\u2019s breakthrough confounds outworn prejudices about the two countries  ", "author": "John Thornhill", "published_date": "2025-01-30T12:37:16.931Z", "content": "Triumphalist glee lit up the Chinese internet this week. Just as Google DeepMind\u2019s victory over China\u2019s strongest Go player in 2017 showcased western brilliance in artificial intelligence, so DeepSeek\u2019s release of a world-beating AI reasoning model has this month been celebrated as a stunning success in China.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s smarter and cheaper AI model was a \u201cscientific and technological achievement that shapes our national destiny\u201d, said one Chinese tech executive. The start-up had become a key player in the \u201cChinese Large-Model Technology Avengers Team\u201d that would counter US AI dominance, said another.\n\nChina\u2019s delight, however, spelled pain for several giant US technology companies as investors questioned whether DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough undermined the case for their colossal spending on AI infrastructure. US tech and energy stocks lost $1tn of their market value on Monday, although they regained some ground later in the week.\n\nThe stereotypical image of China abroad may still be that of a state-subsidised, capital-intensive manufacturing economy that excels at churning out impressive low-cost hardware, such as smartphones, solar panels and electric vehicles. But, in truth, China long ago emerged as a global software superpower, outstripping the west in ecommerce and digital financial services, and it has invested massively in AI, too.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s emergence confounds many of the outworn prejudices about Chinese innovation, although it is far from a typical Chinese company. It certainly invalidates the old saw that while the US innovates, China imitates and Europe regulates. In several ways, DeepSeek resembles a bootstrapped Silicon Valley start-up, even if it was not founded in a garage. Launched in 2023, the company has the same high-flown ambition as OpenAI and Google DeepMind to attain human-level AI, or artificial general intelligence (AGI). But its founder Liang Wenfeng runs one of China\u2019s leading hedge funds, meaning the company has not had to raise external financing.\n\nIn an interview republished in the China Talk newsletter, Liang explained that DeepSeek operated more as a research lab than a commercial enterprise. When recruiting, it prioritised capabilities over credentials, hiring young Chinese-educated researchers. Liang said these people were given the space to explore and the freedom to make mistakes. \u201cInnovation often arises naturally \u2014 it\u2019s not something that can be deliberately planned or taught,\u201d he said.\n\nDeepSeek relies on open-source AI models, such as Meta\u2019s Llama, in contrast to the proprietary models favoured by OpenAI and Google. It also focuses narrowly on language in its quest to reach AGI rather than attempting to go multimodal and incorporating images, audio and video. \u201cWhat you think of as \u2018thinking\u2019 might actually be your brain weaving language. This suggests that humanlike AGI could potentially emerge from language models,\u201d he said.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s focused approach has enabled it to develop a compelling reasoning model without the need for extraordinary computing power and seemingly at a fraction of the cost of its US competitors. As with other Chinese apps, US politicians have been quick to raise security and privacy concerns about DeepSeek. And OpenAI has even accused the Chinese company of possible breaches of intellectual property rights. Given the cases against OpenAI for infringing others\u2019 copyright, though, that might strike some as rich.\n\nWhile some big US tech companies responded to DeepSeek\u2019s model with disguised alarm, many developers were quick to pounce on the opportunities the technology might generate. The capabilities and cheapness of DeepSeek\u2019s reasoning model may allow them to deploy it for an ever-expanding number of uses. On Monday, DeepSeek was the most downloaded free app on the US Apple App Store.\n\nIronically, that may yet enable the US to benefit more from DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough than China. Over the past few years, China has been throttling its own private sector as the state has exerted tighter control. The number of start-ups launched in China has plummeted since 2018. According to PitchBook, venture capital funding in China fell 37 per cent to $40.2bn last year while rising strongly in the US.\n\nDeepSeek has punctured the hubris of the US tech oligarchs. It has intensified global competition and will accelerate the adoption of AI tools. Temporarily this could be a case of China innovating and the US imitating. But is it just a spectacular blip or the start of a long-term trend?\n\njohn.thornhill@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d72e0750-6a8b-4ef4-b9e1-6d35fd2a69b8"}, {"uuid4": "edf0c3f2-1c09-47b3-b9b3-71bd24c19a2b", "title": "\u2018Back to 1897\u2019: Latin America scrambles to respond to Donald Trump\u2019s aggression", "description": "Colombia\u2019s President Gustavo Petro finds little support for confrontational stance against US", "author": "Joe Daniels", "published_date": "2025-01-27T19:18:11.615Z", "content": "Latin American presidents will hold an emergency summit on Thursday to respond to President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportations of migrants as they reel from his aggressive tactics towards two of Washington\u2019s traditional regional allies.\n\nTrump clamped 25 per cent tariffs on trade with Colombia and imposed visa and other sanctions on Sunday after leftwing President Gustavo Petro turned back US military flights deporting migrants. The confrontation ended within hours after Bogot\u00e1 caved in to Washington\u2019s demands.\n\nThe dramatic clash, much of it conducted over social media, unsettled Latin American nations already scared by Trump\u2019s threats of military force to re-establish US control over the Panama Canal and of steep tariffs on Mexico, the US\u2019s biggest trading partner.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of alarm among the Latin American embassies in Washington,\u201d said a senior regional diplomat in Washington. \u201cWe seem to have gone back to 1897 and the era of President [William] McKinley, who invaded Cuba and the Philippines.\u201d\n\nEmerging market currencies were rattled by Sunday\u2019s dispute, with the Mexican peso and South African rand both falling about two per cent against the US dollar. Colombia\u2019s peso fell 1.5 per cent against the dollar on Monday morning before recovering a little ground.\n\nPanama, a nation of just 4.5mn people with no army and a heavy dependence on US trade and investment, is seen as particularly vulnerable to Trump\u2019s demands for Washington to take back control of the canal it built more than a century ago. The US president has claimed China now operates the canal and US shipping is being \u201cripped off\u201d by the charges to use the waterway.\n\nHonduran President Xiomara Castro called an emergency summit of the region\u2019s leaders in her capacity as head of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac), after a request by Petro. The meeting will discuss migration, the environment and regional unity, she said on X.\n\nMichael Shifter, a senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue think-tank in Washington, said Latin American leaders were unlikely to defer to Trump.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to try to strike a balance,\u201d he said, \u201crecognising that on the one hand, they have to be pragmatic because Trump is actually capable of imposing sanctions, which would be very painful for these countries. On the other side, they really have to save face as well and show they have national pride and protect sovereignty.\u201d\n\nRussian allies Cuba and Venezuela gave swift backing to Petro, a former guerrilla with a long record of rants against US policy on social media on issues ranging from Gaza to the war on drugs. But the region\u2019s biggest powers, Brazil and Mexico, did not comment publicly.\n\nDiplomats said they wanted to co-ordinate positions discreetly and let the dust settle before taking a public stance.\n\n\u201cPetro has given a lesson in how not to deal with Trump,\u201d said a second regional diplomat. \u201cHe went into battle on social media without having a way to sustain his fight.\u201d\n\nSeveral commentators pointed out the Colombian leader had undermined his own position by previously agreeing to take US military flights deporting migrants, which date back years under Democrat and Republican administrations.\n\nColombia, traditionally the closest US ally in South America, is heavily reliant on the US market for its exports of oil, coffee and cut flowers, and has little leverage with Washington.\n\nThe timing was also awkward, with Colombia\u2019s foreign minister Luis Gilberto Murillo \u2014 a pragmatic English speaker and ex-ambassador to Washington \u2014 due to be replaced on February 1 by Laura Sarabia, Petro\u2019s 30-year-old chief of staff, who has no diplomatic experience.\n\nWith Petro\u2019s whereabouts on Sunday unclear, a crisis team made up of Sarabia, Murillo and other officials met in the presidential palace and the foreign ministry headquarters. The main interlocutor on the US side, diplomats said, was Mauricio Claver-Carone, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Latin America in the state department. \u201cPetro was in constant communication, always listening and responding,\u201d said a person with direct knowledge of the talks.\n\nBruce Mac Master, president of Colombia\u2019s main business association, spent the day lobbying Petro\u2019s diplomatic team, and spoke with Sarabia several times.\n\n\u201cI think Petro had no idea of the dimensions and impact of US relations,\u201d Mac Master said. \u201cHe soon realised that the effects would be felt everywhere, starting with the exchange rate. I think he learned more about economics from that than he had in the rest of his life.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Mexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum is seen in the region as having handled Trump better. She has made her disagreements with US policy clear in measured public comments, while privately agreeing to many of Trump\u2019s demands on taking back migrants and cracking down on fentanyl trafficking.\n\nChina has hugely expanded its trade and investment in Latin America this century, and Beijing is likely to view Trump\u2019s unpredictable moves as an ideal opportunity to present itself as a more reliable partner, diplomats and analysts said.\n\nShifter, of Inter-American Dialogue, said: \u201cCelac is the platform for China in Latin America, so Thursday\u2019s summit is a kind of proxy for showing [Washington] that if [it is] really going to punish us, then China\u2019s willing to fill the gap and come in even more than it has already.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Tommy Stubbington in London", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/feaa544c-ca50-46f1-aeb0-770d190fdf14"}, {"uuid4": "10dbd378-94a7-4adf-a48b-006940b05ad5", "title": "Where \u2018woke\u2019 went wrong\u00a0", "description": "Seemingly irresistible just a few years ago, movements aimed at addressing systemic inequalities are now in retreat. Can they recover?", "author": "Henry Mance", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.807Z", "content": "All revolutions face a backlash. A few years ago, Elon Musk and other supporters of Donald Trump started denouncing the \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d. In 2023, the US Supreme Court ruled that affirmative action in university admissions was illegal. Rightwing activists began preparing legal warfare against companies with high-profile diversity initiatives.\n\nSince becoming president, Trump has ordered an end to federal government diversity efforts, including some dating back to Lyndon Johnson, and may expel trans people from the US military. Walmart and Amazon are among the companies closing down their own diversity schemes. Mark Zuckerberg, who had once celebrated Facebook\u2019s role in making #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter viral, now said its parent company needed more \u201cmasculine energy\u201d and would end its targets for hiring women and minorities.\u00a0Corporate America had gone from taking the knee to bending it.\n\nBut perhaps equally telling has been the loss of faith among the revolution\u2019s natural supporters. Kamala Harris, who once criticised Joe Biden\u2019s record on desegregation, backed away from wokeness. (Trump ads still said: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d) In the UK Keir Starmer changed his view on trans rights. Between 2021 and 2024, the proportion of British people who said efforts to ensure equal opportunities for trans people hadn\u2019t gone far enough fell from 32 per cent to 22 per cent.\n\nProgressive activists could once insist that criticisms of their causes were confected. This has become harder. The critics included people, such as philosophers Sam Harris and Susan Neiman, who define themselves as on the left.\n\nThe achievement of Black Lives Matter was to make support almost the default option. Shortly after George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis in 2020, protesters\u2019 signs read simply: \u201cWhite silence is violence.\u201d The movement was not hoping to persuade people. It was expecting them to participate.\n\nIn this, Black Lives Matter was initially hugely successful. Within weeks of Floyd\u2019s murder, perhaps 20mn Americans, an unprecedented number, went on marches. Government policies were examined for implicit bias. Bosses looked around their offices and asked why they were so white. Workshops were organised, donations promised, senior appointments made. Statues were felled; company logos based on Black stereotypes were replaced.\n\nIn the years before, other movements had similar success. #MeToo called out male sexual abuse. LGBT+ campaigners highlighted the difficulties faced by trans people. After the celebrated expansion of gay rights, lots of people wanted to be on the right side of history. They added rainbows to their online profiles and pronouns to their email signatures. Trans celebrities became sought-after brand ambassadors.\n\nToday, however, many progressives have decided that speaking up is no longer so urgent. Silence has resumed. If these movements are to rise again, they need to overcome not just their opponents, but their own limitations.\n\nThe term \u201cwoke\u201d emerged from the American Black community to describe awareness of the injustices faced by Black people, later gaining currency among the wider left. Critics on the right took the word and made it pejorative, just as they weaponised \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d in the 1990s. Today they often deploy it disingenuously.\n\nWokeness \u2014 there is still no better term \u2014 now describes attempts to address systemic inequalities faced by disadvantaged groups, including women, people of colour, LGBT+ people and those with disabilities. It assumes that people can discriminate unconsciously by upholding inequitable norms.\n\nTo many supporters, these attempts continued campaigns such as the US civil rights movement. Those past revolutions had been only partly successful. The killing of Floyd, and others such as teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, showed that the law was still not equally applied to Black people in the US. Old inequalities persisted. New ones emerged: tech companies apologised after their algorithms generated racist results.\n\nIf wokeness faced resistance, supporters could point to those who had opposed civil rights in the 1960s, or who had moaned about the suppression of sexist and racist jokes in the 1990s.\n\nThe problem, as writer Yascha Mounk argues in his book The Identity Trap, is that the new activism was built on a rejection of the civil rights movement\u2019s optimistic pursuit of equality and racial integration. Its foundations lay in the post-structuralism of Michel Foucault, in postcolonial studies and in critical race theory. Derrick Bell, founder of critical race theory, argued in 1991 that Black people in the US had in effect seen no progress since slavery, and that yearning for racial equality was a \u201cfantasy\u201d.\n\nBell\u2019s precise words may not have spread widely, but examples of woke over-reach did. In 2020-21, Black Lives Matter activists occupied the city of Portland for months, causing millions of dollars of damage. Calls to \u201cdefund the police\u201d complicated law enforcement in many US cities, allowing critics to question if it was inadvertently making life more dangerous, not less.\n\nLess grave, but equally eye-catching, was some counterintuitive theorising. Some descriptions of racial equity suggested that punctuality was a trait of \u201cwhiteness\u201d. Some trans rights activists adopted the terms \u201cLatinx\u201d and \u201cpeople who menstruate\u201d \u2014 terms that most of the people they were referring to would reject.\n\nIn the 1990s, political correctness meant saying \u201cchair\u201d instead of \u201cchairman\u201d, and \u201csex worker\u201d instead of \u201cprostitute\u201d (the idea of calling short people \u201cvertically challenged\u201d came from critics). Recent conceptual and linguistic shifts were arguably much sharper. \u201cWhite privilege\u201d, \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d and \u201ccisgender\u201d entered the lexicon.\n\nEven away from these extremes, \u201cwokeness\u201d clashed with some tenets of liberal society. It defined people as being part of a group, not as individuals. It encouraged people to identify as Black, queer or whatever else. For Robin DiAngelo, the white author of the bestselling book White Fragility, white people were inherently racist.\n\nAll this ran counter to the civil rights era\u2019s focus on equality and to how many citizens wished to see themselves. As early as 2015, veteran civil rights activist Barbara Reynolds argued that Black Lives Matter was mistaken in not claiming the slogan \u201call lives matter\u201d for its own (and for not adopting the church-inspired respectability of 1960s protesters).\n\nInside companies, group awareness was initially welcomed: staff networks for Black, Asian, LGBT+, disabled people and others sprung up. But bosses now admit to second thoughts. \u201cWere we beginning to focus too much on all these areas of difference, versus saying this is fundamentally about inclusion and respecting difference, rather than necessarily needing to call it out?\u201d says Peter Cheese, chief executive of CIPD, the UK\u2019s body for HR professionals. \u201cWe can\u2019t deal with every aspect of people\u2019s difference at work.\u201d\n\nCompanies invested in anti-bias training, including from DiAngelo. But some evidence suggested that it had little effect. While diversity programmes focused on race and gender, conversations on class were often lacking. \u201c[Employees would say,] what do you mean \u2018white privilege\u2019? I came from a working-class background and I\u2019ve worked my way up,\u201d says Kamal Munir, a professor at Cambridge\u2019s Judge Business School. \u201cIt was also seen as a zero-sum game.\u201d\n\nClass wasn\u2019t the only blind spot. The epithet \u201cKaren\u201d emerged to refer to entitled white women: it went from light-hearted meme to blatant sexism. In May 2023, Uber\u2019s head of diversity left after employees complained that her \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Karen\u201d training sessions were too focused on white people\u2019s hardships.\n\nA key demand for campaigners was the representation of disadvantaged groups. This had liberating effects. After #OscarsSoWhite went viral in 2015, when all 20 acting nominations went to white people, more actors of colour started to be recognised. Representation was long overdue. But it is not the whole ballgame. Does Emilia P\u00e9rez, a Netflix film about Mexican cartel violence, not deserve its Oscar nominations because it was made by mostly non-Mexican cast and crew? As the director pointed out in his defence, Shakespeare never went to Verona. In 2021, an award-winning, non-binary Dutch novelist, chosen to translate the work of the Black American poet Amanda Gorman, stepped down after criticism that a Black translator should do the job.\n\nIn less high-profile contexts, who was speaking came to overshadow what they said. It can be powerful, and funny, to question an opinion on the basis that it comes from a white man. Deployed repetitively, it short-circuits debate. Listening to speakers preface their comments with their identity became exhausting.\n\nActivists also set about changing what it was acceptable to say, or be associated with. Ibram X Kendi, author of the bestselling book How to Be an Antiracist, apologised for using \u201cableist\u201d terms such as \u201ccrazy\u201d, \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cdumb\u201d. Robin DiAngelo listed things white people should not say, including: \u201cI can\u2019t say anything right.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, the football team LA Galaxy released a player after his wife posted racist messages on Instagram, even though he disavowed them (he became the Serbian Super League\u2019s top scorer). A British children\u2019s author was dropped by her publisher for expressing support for JK Rowling\u2019s views on trans issues (she became a truck driver).\n\nThis strictness was politically inadvisable. In 2018 and again in 2021, a majority of Americans said they didn\u2019t want political correctness to go further. Barack Obama rightly judged that voters didn\u2019t want to feel as though they were \u201cwalking on eggshells\u201d; they wanted acknowledgment that \u201clife is messy\u201d.\n\nIn its purer forms, wokeness offered not tolerance and debate, but punishment and re-education. This was intellectually wrong. Many people could accept that racial discrimination existed, and that Floyd\u2019s murder was horrific. But they disagreed with the weight that activists put on discrimination. A US survey found that white progressives were more likely than Black and Hispanic people to say that racism is built into US society \u2014 and less likely to say that most people can get ahead if they work hard.\n\nRadical societal changes deserved debate. This was most notable on trans issues. Did giving puberty blockers to children raise questions of informed consent and long-term health risks? Even asking such questions was frowned upon, right up to 2024, when a review of NHS England\u2019s gender identity service concluded the use of puberty blockers rested on \u201cweak evidence\u201d.\n\nLGBT+ campaigners had reasons for not wishing to be drawn into such debates. As Shon Faye argued in her book The Transgender Issue, media framing could itself be oppressive. Trans people felt their existence mocked. Many also distrusted the medical establishment, which they felt had neglected their needs. There was a view that questioning trans campaigners\u2019 outlook made trans people less safe \u2014 both psychologically, but also physically, because it could lead to policy changes where trans healthcare was further restricted.\n\nBut the result was unsatisfactory. Trans activists often labelled their critics as \u201ctransphobic\u201d. The public had signed up to colourful LGBT+ Pride rainbows; they now often saw toxic social media debates. (Critics also bore much responsibility for the toxicity.) For many who were gently supportive of the cause, it marked trans issues as worth steering clear of.\n\nEventually the law defended free speech. In 2021, a British employment tribunal ruled that a woman called Maya Forstater had been unlawfully discriminated against, when her contract was not renewed because of her gender-critical views.\n\nSimilarly, racial diversity efforts clashed with basic employment rules. Previously employers could talk about hiring a candidate from a more diverse background if two candidates were equal. This was always dubious: two candidates are never equal, and a thumb could always be placed on the scales in one direction or another.\n\nAround 2020, some organisations wanted to go faster in hiring diverse candidates. (Being a woman, or Jewish, was probably not sufficient.) At least in some cases, they clearly discriminated against white employees. In 2022 Britain\u2019s Thames Valley Police promoted an Asian officer without a competitive process; three white officers who weren\u2019t given the chance to apply later won a discrimination claim. Perhaps the law should give employers greater leeway to address society\u2019s inequalities. But it did not. Again, the managers who wanted to drive change from the inside, and the activists on the outside, were moving faster than liberal society, and most people\u2019s sense of fairness, could handle.\n\nThe intense social activism of mid-2020 \u2014 heightened by outrage at the Trump presidency, and perhaps the emotional strain of Covid \u2014 was never sustainable. By April 2024, 52 per cent of Americans thought the US had done enough to make up for past discrimination against Black people. 2020 showed how permeable companies were to prevailing political winds. Those winds became the economy and immigration.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s hard to disentangle the rise and fall of \u201cwoke\u201d from US politics. This month, when Zuckerberg rolled back Meta\u2019s diversity initiatives, and changed its moderation policies so that users could post things such as \u201cGays are freaks\u201d, the company explained: \u201cIt\u2019s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms.\u201d For less spineless bosses too, the changing political moment was useful cover to push back at activists\u2019 and diversity managers\u2019 strictures.\n\nThe woke revolution might have lasted longer had progressives not been so sceptical of universal ideas and free debate. Voters are not part of an anti-woke crusade. Trans issues don\u2019t register in British voters\u2019 priorities. A majority of Britons support supposedly woke ideas, like returning the Parthenon marbles to Greece. Two-thirds of Americans support DEI programmes. But many of them did become disengaged from the movements that they had once supported.\n\nThis might have been more manageable if activists were as well-organised as their most cynical opponents. Instead, Black Lives Matter lacked established leaders and structures. (In both the US and the UK, activists were jailed for fraudulent use of donations.) Soon progressives had also lost arguably their most influential social network, Twitter: it soured with abuse, then was corrupted by Musk.\n\nWere he alive, Derrick Bell might argue that the backlash is proof that racism always reasserts itself. But for believers in progress, the woke revolution can claim plenty of victories. It aimed higher than the move to political correctness, and it propelled forward awareness of race, gender and sexual identity. Within corporations, \u201ca lot of progress was made\u201d, says Munir at the University of Cambridge. \u201cPeople did make a lot of effort to tap more diverse talent pools. [But] progress is never linear.\u201d\n\nThe fate of diversity initiatives dovetails with that of climate policies. Just because climate action is less politically fashionable does not mean it is less urgent. And just because Black Lives Matter and trans rights are no longer the zeitgeist does not mean economic and social disparities have been closed. \u201cSilence is violence\u201d is one of many things that progressive activists were wrong about. But silence is not the best strategy either.\n\nHenry Mance is the FT\u2019s chief features writer\n\nComments on this story will open at 9am GMT on Sunday\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5ba3c3a8-8ccb-414e-b299-41f5b0e29021"}, {"uuid4": "810d5e68-603f-47ac-9cda-16184002eb0f", "title": "Maps distort reality while revealing the eternal truth about politics", "description": "Trump\u2019s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico is part of a long tradition of deploying cartography in the service of power", "author": "Tony Barber", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.583Z", "content": "Well, is it the Gulf of America or the Gulf of Mexico? Is it Mount McKinley or Mount Denali? For Google Maps users, the answer will depend on whether you live in Donald Trump\u2019s America or the rest of the world.\n\nIn complying with Trump\u2019s insistence on renaming the gulf and America\u2019s highest mountain, Google said this week it had \u201ca longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources\u201d.\n\nUsers of the app outside America will continue to see existing names, but this is unlikely to satisfy Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum. Before Trump\u2019s inauguration, she took a swipe at his plans to retitle the gulf. Vast tracts of the US that once formed part of the Spanish empire and later Mexico might be renamed \u201cAm\u00e9rica Mexicana\u201d, she suggested.\n\nGoogle isn\u2019t the first and will assuredly not be the last mapmaker to fall in line with a government\u2019s wishes. Down the centuries, maps have served ideological, imperialistic, religious and cultural purposes more often than impartial scholarship \u2014 as Mark Monmonier, a US geographer, sets out in his book, How to Lie with Maps.\n\nGreat powers have a penchant for maps that express territorial claims or national grandeur. In recent years, China has held a \u201cnational mapping awareness publicity week\u201d, encouraging citizens to think of Taiwan and parts of the maritime zones of nearby Asian countries as Chinese.\n\nIn Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, the government has used anti-extremism laws to clamp down on maps that question whether Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in 2014, or the Kuril Islands, seized from Japan in 1945, belong to Russia.\n\nSmaller countries are just as likely to get in on the act. Since the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia gained independence in 1991, a long-running sore in relations with Greece and Bulgaria has been the use of nationalist maps that include parts of both countries as \u201cGreater Macedonia\u201d.\n\nViktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, promotes maps that show his country with pre-first world war borders, including areas of modern Croatia, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia. Ludovic Orban, Romania\u2019s former premier, once brushed these efforts off with a Romanian proverb \u2014 \u201cthe sparrow dreams of the dough\u201d \u2014 implying Hungary\u2019s leader was indulging in fantasy.\n\nDuring the cold war, even weather forecasts contained political messages. West Germany\u2019s ARD network displayed Germany with pre-second world war frontiers, challenging the communist East German state\u2019s legitimacy.\n\nBefore our times, physical maps published with explanatory texts often betrayed their creators\u2019 assumptions. An 18th-century Japanese map of the world observed of Brazil: \u201cThe inhabitants of this country do not build houses\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009They like to eat human flesh;\u00a0however, they only eat men and not women. Their clothes are made from birds\u2019 feathers.\u201d\n\nIn western countries, our mental picture of the globe remains profoundly influenced by a 1569 map produced by Gerardus Mercator, a Flemish cartographer. In his effort to depict the three-dimensional Earth on a two-dimensional map, Mercator made places far from the equator look relatively larger. This is why Greenland appears about the same size as Africa, though it is not even a tenth as big.\n\nCome to think of it, could Denmark avoid ceding Greenland to the US, as Trump wants, by using maps to flatter his ego? A US-friendly government in Warsaw once proposed naming a Polish military base after the president. That brainwave came to nothing \u2014 meaning the name is free for use. Perhaps Greenland\u2019s capital, Nuuk, known until 1979 as Godth\u00e5b, could be renamed Fort Trump.\n\ntony.barber@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/68d3ba97-18d2-4f4c-8d6b-305040b31c5b"}, {"uuid4": "976eb99d-235c-4ba5-8057-3d19f55f448d", "title": "Donald Trump hits Canada, Mexico and China with steep tariffs", "description": "US president fires starting gun on possible trade war with levies of up to 25% on goods imported from trading partners", "author": "Aime Williams", "published_date": "2025-02-01T23:30:37.087Z", "content": "Donald Trump hit Canada, Mexico and China with steep tariffs on Saturday in a move that threatens to launch a new era of trade wars between the US and three of its largest trading partners.\n\nTrump issued an executive order applying additional tariffs of 25 per cent to all imports from Canada and Mexico, with the exception of Canadian oil and energy products, which will face a 10 per cent levy. Canada is by far the biggest foreign oil supplier to the US, accounting for about 60 per cent of its crude imports.\n\nImports from China will face a 10 per cent tariff over and above existing US tariffs.\n\nPosting on Truth Social, Trump said he used emergency powers to issue the tariffs \u201cbecause of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.\u201d\n\nA White House official said lower tariffs for Canadian energy aimed to minimise the \u201cdisruptive effects\u201d on US petrol and home heating costs, but confirmed there would be no further exclusions.\n\nThe tariffs would apply from Tuesday, the White House said.\n\n\u201cThis is a beautiful, beautiful example of promises made, promises kept by President Trump,\u201d a White House official said.\n\nThe official said each order contained \u201ca retaliation clause\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. so that if any country chooses to retaliate in any way, the signal will be to take further action with respect to likely increased tariffs.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate response from America\u2019s trading partners, although Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was expected to announce retaliatory tariffs later tonight. The Chinese embassy did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe president used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, an executive authority that allows him to respond to emergencies through economic means, to apply the levies without congressional approval. The law has not previously been used to enact tariffs, although Trump threatened to use it against Mexico in 2019.\n\nTrump\u2019s abrupt opening move will dash the hopes of countries that expected a slower and more cautious approach to trade policy after the Trump administration ordered a raft of reviews into US commercial relationships on inauguration day.\n\nIt also signals the president\u2019s willingness to use tariffs to apply pressure to allies on issues ranging from immigration to drug trafficking. Trump has justified the tariffs by complaining about what he says is lax security at the borders with Mexico and Canada, and arguing that both \u2014 along with China \u2014 have failed to do enough to stem the flow of deadly opioids into the US.\n\nOn Saturday, a White House official said the tariffs would be lifted as soon as \u201cAmericans stop dying from Made in China, distributed by Mexico and Canada fentanyl\u201d.\n\nThe official added: \u201cThis is not just about fentanyl\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. this is really a border security issue.\u201d\n\nTrump has also cited America\u2019s trade deficit with Canada, Mexico and China as justification for the tariffs. On Friday, he acknowledged that they may cause some \u201cdisruption\u201d, but added: \u201cThe tariffs are going to make us very rich, and very strong.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Trump said he planned to levy tariffs on EU imports too, but Saturday\u2019s announcement did not include any measures relating to the EU.\n\nTrump held back from imposing the 60 per cent tariff on Chinese imports from\u00a0China that he had threatened during the presidential campaign. The 10 per cent levy was designed to punish Beijing over the flow of ingredients to make fentanyl, a deadly opiate that has been the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45 over the past three years.\n\nBeijing cracked down on the export of fentanyl several years ago, but groups in China switched to exporting precursor chemicals to cartels in Mexico to produce the final product.\n\nDimitry Anastakis, a professor of business at the University of Toronto, said the US tariffs\u00a0could be a shock to the system as painful as the Covid pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt is unnecessary and quite stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is taking a sledge hammer to a non-existent problem with the North American economy that was working pretty well.\u201d\n\nAnastakis said there will be immediate pain in the auto trade, job losses and a likely recession in Canada.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ilya Gridneff in Toronto and Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b9101226-edc1-4cde-93ec-186bc95021d7"}, {"uuid4": "dcde0431-754f-4c02-9ae9-c250243485d6", "title": "\u2018A trade war on steroids\u2019: Trump ushers in new era of US protectionism", "description": "President bets he can achieve his aims through tariffs without igniting inflation or a sell-off in American stocks", "author": "James Politi", "published_date": "2025-02-01T22:17:03.354Z", "content": "Donald Trump has long declared himself a \u201ctariff man\u201d willing to impose sweeping levies on imports from countries that have hurt America.\n\nBut on Saturday, the 78-year old US president took the first dramatic step of his second term towards putting that vision into practice \u2014 placing trade wars and economic nationalism at the top of his agenda.\n\nFrom his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump unleashed aggressive new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, a day after threatening the EU with high levies.\n\nTrump is gambling that he can pressure US trading partners to comply with Washington\u2019s wishes without triggering another damaging acceleration of inflation, at a time when the cost of living remains the top concern of many Americans.\n\nFor the world, Trump\u2019s opening gambit on trade means a series of countries will be forced into bruising negotiations over everything from trade deficits and currency policy to immigration and even America\u2019s new desire for territorial expansion. Financial markets could be shaken and the global economy may suffer.\n\n\u201cThese tariffs herald a new era of US trade protectionism that will affect all American trading partners, whether rivals or allies, and will significantly disrupt international commerce,\u201d says Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University.\n\nThe hardest-hit economies will be Mexico and Canada given their heavy reliance on the US economy, with both facing outright recessions if Trump maintains the 25 per cent tariffs, economists said. The damage will be compounded by the fact that less than six years ago, those countries signed a new trade agreement with Trump in the hope that it would stabilise relations with the US.\n\n\u201cThere are no safe havens,\u201d says Brad Setser, a former US Treasury official now at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cTwo countries that struck the biggest trade deal with Donald Trump in his first term are the first two to get hit with tariffs.\u201d\n\nNeil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, said the macroeconomic effects would depend on how comprehensive the US tariff package was, and how quickly it gets imposed.Some of the impact could be mitigated by appreciation of the dollar and substitution of domestically produced US goods, while corporations may choose to absorb some of the increase in costs via lower profit margins, economists said. But the magnitude of Trump\u2019s first steps \u2014 if fully implemented \u2014 appeared far greater than the more limited trade wars against China and G7 allies during his last time in office.\n\n\u201cThis could be a trade war on steroids,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cThe first round was more targeted. Now they seem to be going across the board \u2014 and faster than I expected,\u201d he added.\n\nEverett Eissenstat, a former Trump economic adviser now at Squire Patton Boggs, said: \u201cI expected the tariffs to go in in a more measured manner. But we can say there is one direction here, and that is that it seems to be escalating.\u201d\n\nThe first tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China may only be the beginning. Trump officials have been considering imposing universal tariffs on all imports, and adding to the levies he imposed on Saturday.\n\nTrump now wants to use tariffs to generate revenue to pay for the extension of trillions of dollars of tax cuts, which can only be achieved through carefully calibrated but hefty levies that could be hard to reverse.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to raising revenue, if the tariff is too low it won\u2019t raise enough money, if it\u2019s too high it will stop trade and then you won\u2019t make any money. They will need to find the sweet spot\u201d, says Bill Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nAs Trump doubles down on tariffs, he faces little resistance from business groups and free-market Republicans who have traditionally balked at his populist policies and sought to rein him in. Jim Risch, the Idaho senator who chairs the Senate foreign relations committee, cheered his latest moves.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has always been very clear that if he sees Americans being taken advantage of, he won\u2019t put up with it,\u201d he said. Referring to Canada, Mexico, and China, he added: \u201cThese governments know very well that they need to stem the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants into our country. The sooner they do that, the better.\u201d\n\nBut there are two big dangers for Trump. One would be a sell-off that sends equity markets and the value of Americans\u2019 retirement plans plunging. The other would be that inflation picks up again after gradually falling towards its 2 per cent target over the past two and a half years.\n\nShearing said that Trump\u2019s proposed measures could push headline PCE inflation above 3 per cent, compared with 2.6 per cent now. Hefty levies on the EU and China would push US price growth even higher, he warned.\u201cThat is a big hit, especially for working families including people who voted for Trump on the rationale that he would reduce prices,\u201d said James Knightley, chief international economist in the US at ING.\u201cThe risks are we see some real pain for the household sector coming through later this year, especially if he expands tariffs on Europe.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, who have been looking for ways to attack Trump early in his second term, have already pounced on the potential for higher inflation.\n\n\u201cSlapping huge tariffs on gas, groceries, phones, TVs and cars means working American families are going to pay more for the things they need,\u201d said Ron Wyden, the Oregon senator, on Friday.\n\n\u201cThese tariffs only make sense as class warfare, forcing typical Americans to foot the bill for another round of tax breaks for Trump and his rich buddies.\u201d\n\nTrump has found comfort in the fact that inflation remained subdued during the trade wars of his first term.\n\nBut Jay Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, noted last week that conditions had changed compared with the structurally low-inflation environment before the pandemic. \u201cYou\u2019re coming through a situation where we\u2019re not quite back to 2 per cent and that\u2019s just different,\u201d he said. For the global economy, one potentially bleak scenario would be that of \u201cmassive supply shock\u201d, said Knightley, similar to the shocks economies weathered during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThe risk is that this is going to be quite damaging, especially if we see a significant response. And I don\u2019t see how politicians don\u2019t respond.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/32bedf88-cf5d-494e-ae45-4f94a3cec6f9"}, {"uuid4": "f8aec80e-da1a-4132-a53e-bfe1f2ad40b6", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s China claims roil Panama as Marco Rubio visits", "description": "Central American nation in \u2018panic\u2019 as US president issues threats over canal", "author": "Stefania Palma", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.798Z", "content": "Panama traded on a reputation as a solid US ally and thriving hub for global business \u2014 until US President Donald Trump took office demanding the return of the shipping canal built by the Americans more than a century ago.\n\nNow the Central American nation, whose cultural links with the US include a passion for baseball, is reeling at its portrayal in Washington as a corrupt rogue state in cahoots with Iran and China that seeks to rip off the US at every turn.\n\nCaught in a fierce geopolitical battle, Panama\u2019s predicament offers a taste of what could happen to other nations that have profited from globalisation and hoped to stay neutral, if they fall foul of Washington\u2019s anti-China mood.\n\nUS secretary of state Marco Rubio claimed to a US radio station this week that China could potentially \u201cshut down the Panama Canal\u201d in any conflict. Ahead of a trip to Panama this weekend, he added: \u201cAnd in fact, I have zero doubt that they have contingency planning to do so. That is a direct threat.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed in a social media post on Christmas Day that the \u201cwonderful soldiers of China\u201d were \u201clovingly but illegally operating the Panama Canal\u201d and has pledged to take back the waterway, using force if necessary. He has since repeated that threat, including in a post-inauguration speech.\n\nPanama\u2019s conservative pro-business president, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, has described the claims of Chinese military control as \u201cnonsense\u201d, insisted the waterway \u201cis and always will be Panama\u2019s\u201d and signalled a willingness to engage in dialogue \u2014 but nobody in Washington appears to be listening.\n\n\u201cEven as it takes advantage of the global maritime system, Panama has emerged as a bad actor,\u201d Republican senator Ted Cruz said as he opened a committee hearing on the Panama Canal this week. \u201cPanama has for years flagged dozens of vessels in the Iranian \u2018ghost fleet\u2019, which brought Iran tens of billions of dollars in oil profits to fund terror across the world.\u201d\n\nPanama\u2019s government and business elite are beginning to panic, diplomats said, as they realise that although Trump\u2019s rhetoric may be flamboyant, the US president and his allies are serious about pressing their tiny country to make concessions and reduce China\u2019s presence \u2014 even if it means tearing up legally binding agreements.\n\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d one envoy said of Mulino\u2019s government. \u201cThey have been holding nonstop meetings trying to work out what Trump really wants.\u201d\n\nComplicating Panama\u2019s efforts to counter Trump\u2019s accusations is the country\u2019s poor record on corruption and its growing embrace of China after it broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 2017 in order to establish relations with Beijing. It also joined the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\n\nWhen attacking Chinese influence, US critics of Panama have focused on two ports at either end of the canal which are run by Hutchison Ports, an arm of Hong Kong-listed conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings, under long concessions. They were renewed without a bidding process in 2021 for 25 years.\n\nThe broader group rose to prominence before the UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997; it operates 53 ports in 24 countries including the UK and Germany. The ports in Panama have a nearly 40 per cent market share, and the country launched an audit of the licences after Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nAlso in Panama, Chinese state-controlled companies have built a huge convention centre close to the mouth of the canal and are constructing a new bridge over the waterway and a cruise ship port, contracts that were secured through bidding processes. Beijing was seeking to build a big new embassy on land near the canal until US objections killed the scheme.\n\nPanama also planned to negotiate a free trade deal with China this year, though its status is now unclear.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing a divided Washington agrees on, it\u2019s that we\u2019re anti-China,\u201d said a former Trump administration official. \u201cWhat Trump is really saying is that China exerts an undue influence on the canal through operating ports at both ends, and that\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nChina has insisted Panama\u2019s independence is \u201cnot negotiable\u201d and the canal \u201cis not under direct or indirect control by any power\u201d. \u201cWe respect Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and recognise it as a permanently neutral international waterway,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said this month.\n\nAs for Cruz\u2019s Iran accusations, Panama\u2019s maritime authority in 2023 cancelled the registration of 136 Panamanian-flagged vessels after finding they had a \u201cdirect link\u201d to Iran\u2019s national oil company.\n\nTransparency International ranks Panama 108th in the world in its most recent Corruption Perceptions Index, equal with Sierra Leone, and its score has deteriorated recently.\n\nPanamanian officials insist their country has cleaned up its act in recent years, but it spent many years on international blacklists for money laundering and was the centre of the 2016 \u201cPanama Papers\u201d scandal, when a huge data leak from a Panamanian law firm exposed billions of dollars of offshore assets hidden from tax and law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re dealing with is really systematic historic corruption that nobody\u2019s really called out,\u201d Louis Sola, the Trump-appointed chair of the US Federal Maritime Commission, told the Financial Times.\n\nReferring to Tuesday\u2019s senate hearing on Panama, he said: \u201cWe identified very clearly that there\u2019s some sweetheart deals going on\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009As a competition regulator, we have to look at that.\u201d\n\nMulino was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former president Ricardo Martinelli, a billionaire who tapped him as a candidate after he was barred from running again in last year\u2019s election following a money-laundering conviction. Martinelli is sheltering under diplomatic protection in the Nicaraguan embassy in Panama.\n\nTrump\u2019s business has had its own vexed encounter with Panama: the Trump Organization managed a hotel in the country but the arrangement acrimoniously collapsed in 2018, amid a legal dispute, when the owners evicted his company from the building.\n\nUncomfortable in the spotlight and unaccustomed to running campaigns to win hearts and minds in Washington, Panama is not trying to fight a media battle with the US president.\n\nGovernment ministers have been instructed to stay tight-lipped and Mulino\u2019s comments have been limited to saying there will be no negotiation about the ownership of the canal.\n\nInstead, myriad small Panamanian flags have been fixed to posts on major roads in the capital and on some pavements and buildings ahead of Rubio\u2019s visit, in a quiet but determined show of nationalism.\n\n\u201cI think we have made a mistake in thinking that it doesn\u2019t matter what [the Americans] say,\u201d said Tony Fletcher, an executive and former head of Panama\u2019s business lobby Conep who formerly worked at US group Gillette.*\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time to start to set the record straight. We have to do it in writing, with publications, and above all because in this war of disinformation what needs to prevail is well-sourced information.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhy would I be looking at Iran and other countries?

A ferocious US tech sell-off spread to energy stocks and utilities that had been expected to benefit from demand for power to fuel AI data centres.\n\nBut since then, the sell-off has run out of steam. US indices ended the week lower, with Nvidia close to its Monday lows. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 1 per cent and 1.6 per cent over the past five sessions.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek isn\u2019t devastating for the overall market. The impact will be far more subtle,\u201d said Alicia Levine, head of investment strategy and equities at BNY Wealth.\n\nShe expects healthcare stocks and other companies with access to massive amounts of data to reap the rewards as investors move into less richly priced areas of the market.\n\n\u201cIf AI becomes cheaper and faster, it makes sense that those companies would see a boost in value,\u201d Levine said. \u201cThe picks and shovels\u201d companies in the energy and infrastructure sectors, which have been among the main beneficiaries of Big Tech\u2019s huge capital expenditure on AI, may suffer most, she added.\n\nMegacap tech stocks, and excitement around the potential of AI, have been the main driver of the US stock market\u2019s strong performance in recent years. Last year the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks were responsible for more than half of the S&P 500\u2019s gain.\n\nHowever, bears fear that DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough could have huge implications for the spending plans and valuations of some of the Silicon Valley giants that have driven that rally, and for the wider, top-heavy US market, where the largest 10 stocks now account for almost two-fifths of the S&P 500.\n\nDeepSeek \u201ctells us there is growing competition and AI may be harder to monetise than assumed\u201d, said\u00a0Robert Almeida, global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management.\n\nHe thinks the Chinese firm represents the start of a new capital cycle, creating \u201cgrowing supply, growing competition, and lower returns\u201d that may threaten the high valuations of the big AI incumbents.\n\nBillionaire investor Ray Dalio told the Financial Times this week that AI hype had fuelled a \u201cbubble\u201d in US equities.\n\nBeyond Nvidia, big losers this week have been chipmaker Broadcom and energy groups GE Vernova and Constellation Energy.\n\nBut many investors and analysts think the sell-off was a blip rather than the start of a fundamental market shift.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [we\u2019re in] a bubble and I don\u2019t think we are about to see a bubble burst,\u201d said Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief global equity strategist.\u00a0Instead, DeepSeek was simply a reminder that the \u201cdominant tech companies are not immune from disruption and competition\u201d.\n\nInvestor appetite for US tech companies appeared undimmed on Thursday, when shares in Tesla and Meta rose after the two companies pledged to pour billions more dollars into building out their AI infrastructure.\n\nSome think DeepSeek\u2019s cheap alternative to OpenAI\u2019s popular ChatGPT app could in fact spur even higher AI spending in the US. Bank analysts\u2019 notes last week talked of the so-called Jevons paradox \u2014 the theory that demand for technology such as AI will surge as it becomes cheaper and more energy efficient, leading to an overall increase in energy use.\n\n\u201cEverybody is [too] negative. [DeepSeek] is not going to change the underlying demand for computing capacity,\u201d said Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at Nvidia shareholder J Stern & Co, citing massive spending commitments made by groups such as Meta.\n\nHe does not believe Nvidia is overvalued, and thinks that rising profits will support the stock price of some Big Tech firms. \u201cYou may not have an increase in the valuation but you will benefit from the growth in earnings, in revenues and in cash flows.\u201d\n\nVenture capitalist Reid Hoffman, billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn and ManasAI, sees DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough as bullish for the wider AI sector.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek isn\u2019t a game-changer for global AI hegemony, but it is a welcome wake-up call that China\u2019s competitive talent is very capable,\u201d he told the FT.\n\n\u201cMany small AI companies in the US use large models to train their smaller models more efficiently. So a quality model like DeepSeek trained using that tactic is a positive signal for what small AI companies in the US can build,\u201d he added.\n\nSome even think this week\u2019s market turmoil could spark a healthy rebalancing for the wider market.\n\nMarko Kolanovic, JPMorgan\u2019s former chief global markets strategist \u2014 who has long warned of the risks to market stability from investors piling into the same handful of stocks and trades \u2014 said Nvidia\u2019s 17 per cent decline on Monday should provide the market with a \u201cshot in the arm\u201d.The past week\u2019s sell-off may trigger a rotation within the tech sector into relative \u201claggards\u201d like Apple, he said. \u201cMaybe [Nvidia] isn\u2019t such a sure bet after all.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Mari Novik and Harriet Agnew in London", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/265ac5a6-531f-4647-be62-8b9c3d74ca54"}, {"uuid4": "755f584a-4e1c-45c7-8518-0512cfb2b2d4", "title": "Facebook parent Meta in talks to reincorporate outside Delaware  ", "description": "Group is latest tech company to consider move away from longtime American corporate haven ", "author": "Hannah Murphy", "published_date": "2025-01-31T22:21:46.997Z", "content": "Meta is in discussions to reincorporate outside of Delaware, becoming the latest tech group to study exiting the state that has long been considered an American corporate haven.\n\nThe social media group is weighing moving its legal residence to another state, such as Texas, but has not decided on a destination, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe talks come after Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg earlier this month announced the company would move its US-based trust and safety staff from California to Texas as part of a broad \u2018free speech\u2019 overhaul of its approach to content moderation.\n\nZuckerberg said at the time the shift would help the company \u201cbuild trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams\u201d.\n\nMeta has faced allegations from President Donald Trump and his allies that it censors conservatives and is staffed by liberal-leaning employees, but has recently been attempting to court the new administration.\n\nMeta declined to comment on a possible relocation. However, the group said there was no plan to move its corporate headquarters out of California. The Wall Street Journal first reported on its potential reincorporation.\n\nLast year, Elon Musk won shareholder backing to reincorporate electric-vehicle maker Tesla to Texas, leaving Delaware after a dispute over a lawsuit seeking to block his huge pay package, which has been twice repudiated by the state\u2019s corporate law court.\n\nMusk, the world\u2019s richest man, also reincorporated his social platform X from Delaware to Texas.\n\nDelaware has struggled adjudicating disputes with companies with dominant shareholders or dual-class shares. The state\u2019s corporate law imposes higher legal review standards on these so-called controlled companies.\n\nMeta had faced several fiduciary breach lawsuits in Delaware from minority shareholders including against a share reclassification that would have handed more voting power to Zuckerberg, a move the company abandoned in 2017 prior to a trial.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the S&P 500 is incorporated in Delaware and many venture capital investors demand start-ups make their legal domicile there.\n\nCorporate law observers believed investor protections in the state would force management teams to remain in Delaware. But a large company such as Meta leaving could become a bellwether for further migration.\n\nSeparately on Friday, Dropbox, a cloud storage provider, said its shareholders approved a reincorporation to Nevada from Delaware.

Days later, the Fiat and Jeep owner announced $5bn investment in the US; in December, after Trump\u2019s election, the group had reversed a decision to cut 1,100 jobs at a Jeep plant in Ohio.\n\nOne European banker said: \u201cAnyone under-represented in the US or over-represented in Europe\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009would want to make sure they are building the next plant there versus here.\u201d\n\nA rush by companies to expand in the US to defend against tariffs and benefit from potentially less onerous regulation and a strong economy under Trump would follow an earlier surge in investment under his predecessor Joe Biden.\n\nThe Biden administration handed $370bn in loans, subsidies and other support to companies under his flagship Inflation Reduction Act, though Trump has moved to scrap some of the handouts.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ian Johnston in Paris and Ivan Levingston in London", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0d1f9066-e82d-40e8-83e4-614f99df93c8"}, {"uuid4": "09876b41-ef29-418f-b532-b0073ab70227", "title": "Chevron seeks to protect Venezuelan business scrutinised by White House  ", "description": "Chief warns country could be vulnerable to Chinese and Russian influence if it is forced to abandon operations there ", "author": "Jamie Smyth", "published_date": "2025-01-31T20:20:14.256Z", "content": "Chevron is seeking to protect a special US licence allowing it to operate in Venezuela, saying China and Russia will gain influence in the oil-producing nation \u2014 and the western hemisphere \u2014 if it is forced out by Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, Chevron\u2019s chief executive Mike Wirth said the company would engage with the White House after Marco Rubio, US secretary of state, said the licence should be reconsidered.\n\nWirth said Chevron would operate in compliance with US law and \u201cstayed out of the politics\u201d but added that if the US oil major exited it would allow rival nations\u2019 state oil companies to expand in the Latin American country.\n\n\u201cIn Venezuela, in particular, what you have seen when countries from the west leave, you\u2019ve seen companies from China, from Russia, increase their presence as a result,\u201d he said.\n\nWirth said third-party studies suggested Venezuela\u2019s economy would suffer if Chevron exited and could drive migration flows into the US. He made his comments shortly before Trump sent his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, to Venezuela on Friday to discuss a deal for the repatriation of the country\u2019s deportees from the US.\n\nChevron has operated in Venezuela for nearly a century, and its licenses to do so have been extended several times \u2014 including by the first Trump administration \u2014 even as the US has grown increasingly impatient with successive authoritarian regimes in Caracas and imposed economic sanctions to punish its leadership.\n\nIn 2022 Joe Biden\u2019s administration granted a licence authorising Chevron to expand its Venezuelan business, in a show of good faith and hope of improving democratic conditions under authoritarian President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Broad sanctions on the country\u2019s oil sector were lifted in October 2023, allowing companies to do business with PDVSA, Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil producer.\n\nBut Maduro backtracked on a promise to allow the opposition to pick its own candidate in the presidential election last July, and the outcome, in which Maduro was declared the winner in a result widely regarded as fraudulent, have prompted critics on both sides of the political aisle to question whether western companies should still continue doing business there.\n\nThe sanctions were reimposed last April, though individual exemption licences, including Chevron\u2019s, were kept in place.\n\nThat licence has enabled Chevron to boost its Venezuelan production to about 200,000 barrels a day.\n\nChevron, the second-biggest western oil company, had net income of $3.2bn in the fourth quarter compared with $2.2bn a year earlier, but adjusted earnings of $2.06 a share were below Wall Street estimates of $2.11. Its shares fell 4.6 per cent on Friday in New York.\n\nThe group, which was a significant donor to Republican candidates in the recent election cycle, according to Open Secrets, used the phrase \u201cGulf of America\u201d in its earnings material instead of Gulf of Mexico, just days after Trump called for the renaming of the body of water.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s opposition, led by Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, has increased calls to cancel Chevron\u2019s licence.\n\nSpeaking to the FT this month, Machado \u2014 who was banned from running in the election \u2014 warned Chevron and other foreign companies against \u201chelping to prop up\u201d Maduro\u2019s government.\n\nRubio has signalled a tougher approach to the country. At his confirmation hearing this month, he told senators the Biden administration \u201cgot played\u201d by Maduro.\n\nRubio said: \u201cNow they have these general licenses where companies like Chevron are actually providing billions of dollars of money into the regime\u2019s coffers, and the regime kept none of the promises that they made. So all that needs to be re-explored.\u201d\n\nWhen Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term this month, the outgoing Biden administration, alongside the EU and the UK, announced co-ordinated sanctions on Venezuelan officials, though it stopped short of cancelling the exemption licences.\n\nSome experts play down concerns that Chinese and Russian rivals could fill any gap left by Chevron.\n\nFrancisco Monaldi, a Latin America energy expert at Rice University in Houston, said Chinese and Russian oil companies are unlikely to make a move in Venezuela should Chevron leave.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t done it during the past few years, and particularly since US sanctions have been in place, they have been very cautious,\u201d Monaldi said.\n\nWirth said Chevron was owed a significant amount of money in Venezuela. \u201cLook, we\u2019re running a business.

In recent years, the entrepreneur Elon Musk has become (in)famous for being so maniacally focused on overhauling entities such as Tesla and X that he has slept in offices and fired employees he considered uncommitted.\n\nNow he wants to do the same at Donald Trump\u2019s White House. This week, 2mn federal employees were asked to resign if they did not want to come into the office (and, by implication, embrace the reforms Musk is hatching at the new Department of Government Efficiency he leads).\n\nThe White House apparently expects 5-10 per cent of staff to take the offer, saving $100bn annually. And to reinforce the message, Musk even dispatched the same \u201cFork-in-the-road\u201d meme used when he fired staff at X. He is reportedly sleeping in the Executive Office of the President, too.\n\nUnions will undoubtedly howl. So will progressives. And Musk\u2019s plans will probably face legal challenges. But even as many observers recoil, quite understandably, from Musk\u2019s brutal style, there is one point that no one should ignore: if Doge can actually unleash digital reform in the US government, and in a non-corrupt manner, that would be an unambiguously good thing.\n\nIndeed, if I had a Musk-focused magic wand, I would wish him to make digital reform, not trolling his critics, Doge\u2019s main priority. Digitising government is not just the key to creating greater efficiency and effectiveness; it could also restore some of the public\u2019s shattered trust in the state.\n\nThe reason for this is that America is bedevilled by a paradox. On the one hand, its private sector is extraordinarily dynamic, and driving much of the 21st-century tech revolution, with its laser-like focus on consumers. But on the other, its government bureaucracy is sclerotic and inefficient, with an antediluvian approach to technology.\n\nSo much so, in fact, that the US does not even feature in the UN\u2019s 2024 list of the 18 most tech-savvy e-governments, ranking well behind countries such as Estonia, Singapore and Denmark, and even Saudi Arabia. That is shocking.\n\nPrevious administrations have tried to change this. In 2014, Barack Obama created the United States Digital Service, in a bid to improve government tech after the botched rollout of his HealthCare.gov initiative. This has had some success. As Deloitte notes, the Inland Revenue Service introduced an automated paper returns-scanning process during the Covid pandemic which enabled it to scan \u201c80 times more returns in the first quarter of 2023 than the whole of 2022\u201d. And during Trump\u2019s first administration, his son-in-law Jared Kushner tried to overhaul electronic record-keeping at the Department of Veterans Affairs (a laudable move that, sadly, had patchy results).\n\nBut reformers have faced big obstacles. One is a government culture of risk aversion, says Brett Goldstein of Vanderbilt University, who previously oversaw the Defense Digital Service at the Pentagon. Another is that federal structures are fragmented and plagued by outdated tech.\n\n\u201cThere are 101 civilian agencies\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and back in 2017 we were spending $60bn a year on [those] and half was on legacy systems,\u201d laments Chris Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the first Trump administration. \u201cNow it is certainly more.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge, outlined in a recent book by Jennifer Pahlka, a Democrat who has fought for tech reform, is that the government typically plans projects in a slow-moving, top-down manner \u2014 unlike the private sector, which uses an iterative, bottom-up, user-focused approach. The consequence is \u201cconcrete boat[s]\u201d, she notes. In other words, projects so heavy they sink.\n\nCan Musk change this? Many techies hope so. \u201cI think Elon is the right person for the job since he has a bottom-up approach and the energy and tenacity to go into the details,\u201d says Goldstein. Or, as Krebs, puts it: \u201cWhat is happening now is much bigger and more intentional than [what we did before].\u201d\n\nAnd there is widespread consensus on what should be done: install a \u201csoftware as a service\u201d mentality into government that focuses on user needs, with a centralised \u201cshare services\u201d model. That could create a co-ordinated procurement process that would slash costs, create a better experience for citizens and improve cyber defence.\n\nMoreover, case studies show how to do this. Canada adopted a shared service approach more than a decade ago, notes Krebs. Estonia, Denmark and Singapore are also good models. And Ukraine offers a particularly inspirational example of how to build apps that provide government services to citizens.\n\nSo will Musk ever succeed in inculcating these non-American lessons? Does he have the tenacity, force and staff for a lengthy cultural fight? We don\u2019t know.\n\nBut one thing, at least, is clear: if Musk does manage to import approaches from places such as Estonia or Singapore \u2014 and in the process create a functioning e-government in the US \u2014 he will deserve praise from Republicans and Democrats alike. So, please, Elon: focus on that, not political posturing. Future generations of Americans will thank you.\n\ngillian.tett@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f9754b26-25fc-4403-8d42-3b12e82cd20f"}, {"uuid4": "d0a18632-0fef-49ac-92d1-75eeaba611c9", "title": "Wise ordered to pay $2.5mn in US for misleading fee advertising", "description": "London-listed fintech handed penalty by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for \u2018series of illegal actions\u2019 ", "author": "Akila Quinio", "published_date": "2025-01-31T09:37:43.242Z", "content": "London-listed fintech Wise has been ordered to pay nearly $2.5mn by US regulators for \u201ca series of illegal actions\u201d including misleading advertising of its fees.\n\nThe US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday demanded Wise pay a $2mn civil penalty and $450,000 in customer compensation for advertising inaccurate fees and failing to properly disclose exchange rates and other costs.\n\nWise prides itself on offering cheap and quick cross-border payments, without hidden costs.

A lot of people spend their whole career trying to get one title so, for me,\u00a0two titles [in one year] was a massive achievement.\u201d Her next priority is to do well at the Slams \u2013 so far her\u00a0best\u00a0performances have been third rounds at Wimbledon and the US Open in 2023.\n\nShe puts part of her success down to life-work balance, the support of her team, her fianc\u00e9 Alex de Minaur (the Australian-born world No 18 player), family and her new fitness trainer, Matt Little. \u201cMy team pushes me through the tough moments and the good moments. They keep me motivated. It\u2019s never-ending tennis,\u201d she says.\u00a0 The player is appreciated by fans for her generous, smiley\u00a0demeanour on and off the court. She and de Minaur are often seen at each other\u2019s games, cheering each other on. Most days, though, are intense: the training involves two to three hours of practice, plus two gym sessions and recovery time in physio and cryo bath. Downtime is spent exploring the cities they land in. For James, the most important thing is a rest from phone calls and emails. He restores his vintage cars and regularly plays tennis. \u201cIt is great for clearing the mind,\u201d he asserts. \u201cWhat a terrible idea!\u201d jokes Katie.\n\nThe siblings\u2019 discipline and focus was instilled as children growing up in Leicestershire, in a family that rewarded both play and work. Tennis is in the blood. Their mother Susan, a teacher and tennis coach, played the game at county level, as did their maternal grandmother Gill Gartshore, while the siblings\u2019 businessman father David encouraged the duo to go for it and persevere. James was Katie\u2019s main tennis partner and they played regularly at the local court. \u201cHow many times did James get into a bad mood and storm off the court? I can tell you a few times!\u201d laughs Katie, who was driven by the simple challenge of\u00a0beating her older brother. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much how I landed in tennis.\u201d James also followed the family tradition for a time, making it to county level for Leicestershire. \u201cMy mum or grandpa would often take us both to tournaments at the weekends around the country\u2026 however, as Katie would come back with trophy after trophy, it became clear she had something special, and by the age of eight she\u00a0was already representing Great Britain,\u201d he says.\n\nJames\u2019s journey into the entertainment field was circuitous. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody, especially in the UK, tells you that you could be a Hollywood agent. It doesn\u2019t come up in career counselling,\u201d he says. He left school at 18 and first started a packaged-goods health-food business, before moving into\u00a0management consultancy, overseeing brands and interacting with talent. He then took that knowledge into the entertainment world, setting up his own agency in London in 2019. Indian actress and producer Priyanka Chopra Jonas was one of his first signings, entrusted to him by her manager Anjula Acharia.\n\n\u201cI was representing a small set of talent and building their businesses across anything that\u2019s commercial \u2013endorsements, joint ventures, equity deals \u2013 the full scope of anything that is outside of their role as either an actor or musician,\u201d he explains. It led to James joining UTA, one of the largest talent agencies in the world, spearheaded by his mentors, co-head of talent Chris Hart\u00a0and CEO Jeremy Zimmer.\n\nJames and Katie\u2019s professional worlds are aligned and intertwined. Tennis is ever more popular, particularly women\u2019s tennis,\u00a0while sport and fashion are increasingly converging. Katie benefits from hefty sponsorship deals with brands including Nike, Pragnell fine jewellery, Wilson and Lexus, while James masterminds such deals for his clients. He does not represent Katie, with both preferring to preserve their\u00a0sister-brother relationship over business. \u201cThere is a greater convergence between each of those worlds,\u201d he agrees. \u201cThe responsibility is often greater now too:\u00a0talent is global by nature and has to operate and resonate in different territories and still be authentic. We live in an attention economy\u00a0driven by new platforms.\u201d\n\nHe cites a single post by Chopra Jonas for HSBC about the challenges of moving abroad as a southern Asian. \u201cThat one post was watched by around 668 million people, which is over five times the Super Bowl audience, so\u00a0the responsibility to navigate one\u2019s smaller actions, which then inform everything else, is quite huge,\u201d says James. \u201cYour reach across all platforms must be reaching\u00a0half a million,\u201d he nods at Katie.\n\nThe close dynamic between talent and the social media audience has its own drawbacks. For Katie,\u00a0keeping grounded is fundamental, reminding herself of athletes like Jessica Ennis-Hill that she looked up to as a young girl. \u201cI see myself as someone that kids want to look up to. I think every action that I make and the way that I hold myself on the court and off it is vital, because they always pick up on those little things. When I\u2019m having a tough day and I want to crack a racket or scream at something, I always hold back. Being able to control myself and stay classy on court, it\u2019s so important.\u201d\n\nTheir mode of communication is, week to week, through a family WhatsApp group. \u201cWe are good at sharing each other\u2019s little wins as well as the big ones \u2013 but the big wins are pretty evident,\u201d says James. \u201cFor Katie, that\u2019s her performance at a Grand Slam or winning\u00a0a title and, for me,\u00a0it\u2019s a campaign that gets seen\u00a0by billions of people worldwide. We know what each\u00a0of us are doing, so our family chat is used for smaller\u00a0wins and everything in between \u2013 the good, the\u00a0bad, the ugly,\u201d he smiles.", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/73b2b864-9873-44c4-bdd6-cc36a3b125cc"}, {"uuid4": "20080556-12db-425f-9b97-ca4da6e4ae1d", "title": "Canada warns Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs could leave US reliant on Venezuela\u2019s oil ", "description": "Foreign minister M\u00e9lanie Joly holds meetings in Washington in attempt to avert trade war", "author": "Aime Williams", "published_date": "2025-01-31T05:01:44.233Z", "content": "The US would be forced to buy oil from geopolitical rivals such as Venezuela if it disrupted trade with Canada, Ottawa\u2019s foreign minister has warned.\n\nM\u00e9lanie Joly told the Financial Times the US president\u2019s threat to impose levies of 25 per cent on Canadian imports would hit \u201creal people\u201d if relations between the two countries descended into a trade war.\n\n\u201cWe ship oil at a discount which is, ultimately, refined in Texas.

According to an economic pattern identified by the historian Niall Ferguson, hegemonic powers that spent more on interest than on the military in the past entered a period of geopolitical decline. Is this now the fate of the US?\n\nThe current disarray of American public finances makes us imagine the previously unimaginable: the issuer of the world\u2019s foremost reserve currency being overburdened by public debt. This debt is on track to surpass 160 per cent of GDP by mid-century, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. In the next 10 years, State Street says $2tn annually of net issuance of Treasury debt is expected. Unlike in the 2010s, the Federal Reserve and other price-insensitive buyers, such as foreign central banks, may not be net buyers. Some European sovereigns look similarly exposed. Governments seem to perennially believe that their economies are in a bad spot and need propping up through fiscal stimulus.\n\nAs the era of close-to-zero interest rates is fading into history, the debt service burden will inexorably rise. This will come on top of a secular deceleration of the world economy and thus tax receipts; higher public spending on ageing populations; and rising defence outlays. At the same time, political dysfunction is on the rise, rendering fiscal consolidation a remoter prospect.\n\nThankfully, there are institutions that warn investors of rising sovereign risk: the rating agencies. Or are there? It is fair to question whether the big three agencies \u2014 S&P Global, Moody\u2019s and Fitch \u2014 have become more coy about the risks of rich countries. In contrast, the agencies seem more willing to dish out downgrades to emerging and developing economies.\n\nThis ratings bifurcation became glaringly obvious during the Covid-19 pandemic: the agencies downgraded poor countries left, right and centre, but left advanced economies\u2019 ratings unscathed. Fitch has cut credit ratings on the US, France and the UK in recent years. Moody\u2019s and S&P also downgraded France last year. But the trend is more about a divide.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, the Big Three rating changes for rich sovereigns were more negative than for emerging markets. The net change \u2014 upgrades minus downgrades \u2014 of advanced sovereign ratings was about 1 per cent of the rated portfolio per year, compared with an even higher net-upgrade ratio of 8 per cent for emerging markets.\n\nBut between 2015 and 2024, there have been even more upgrades for rich countries (a net balance of about 3 per cent of the portfolio per year), despite what appear to be weakening fundamentals. In sharp contrast, emerging markets saw a net balance of about 4 per cent of their sovereign portfolio downgraded, a huge swing from the buoyant earlier period.\n\nIn the face of deteriorating public finances in Washington during the pandemic and 10 weeks after a violent mob stormed the Capitol. S&P raised its assessment score of the institutional strength of the US on its 1 to 5 range to its top level of 1. This step in effect averted a downgrade\u00a0as its assessment of the US fiscal performance had deteriorated.\n\nThere is no question that many emerging sovereigns\u2019 creditworthiness has taken a hit during the past decade. The net downgrade pattern seems appropriate. But has the forward-looking creditworthiness of the rich world really improved over the same period? That appears far-fetched. What seems more likely is that the agencies have taken fright after lawsuits and regulatory backlashes following the financial and Eurozone debt crisis.\n\nFor example, the S&P \u2014 the first agency to downgrade the US in 2011 \u2014 had been the subject of particular ire from policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic, from a costly Department of Justice lawsuit to criminal prosecution in Italy. Disclosure: I was part of the committee that downgraded the US and I was a defendant in the Italian case in which the agency and my colleagues were acquitted. My time at the S&P ended in 2018.\n\nThe prime role of credit agencies on sovereign debt is to call out credit risk without fear or favour. If not, some investors may be lulled into a false sense of security, which may allow governments to procrastinate and dig themselves into ever-deeper holes. One test might be looming. If US finances deteriorate further, are they prepared to stand up to President Donald Trump and cut ratings?", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f5ceb7b6-1d9f-444d-bfbb-f5110d737e03"}, {"uuid4": "479d1c66-4345-4b01-a4d8-3017d1271fa8", "title": "Grab your popcorn, Masa Son is back", "description": "Plus, carmaker Stellantis bets on a turnaround in Trump\u2019s America and the rising infrastructure star at Blackstone", "author": "Amelia Pollard", "published_date": "2025-01-31T05:00:44.902Z", "content": "One thing to start: McKinsey is considering spinning off its in-house asset manager MIO Partners, which invests the private wealth of the consulting firm\u2019s senior staff and alumni.

DD has missed his often adventurous financial forays.\n\nMasa has been circling the AI craze with relative quiet, but finally he\u2019s within grasp of securing a seat at the table of Silicon Valley\u2019s great investment craze.\n\nSoftBank is in talks to invest as much as $25bn in OpenAI, the darling at the heart of the AI frenzy. The deal would make the Japanese group OpenAI\u2019s biggest financial backer.\n\nThe investment would be part of a bigger funding round of about $40bn at Sam Altman\u2019s company, which would push the ChatGPT-maker\u2019s valuation to $300bn, the FT reported late on Thursday.\n\nMasa\u2019s known for majorly leveraging up his investments (one banker in 2019 said there were \u201clayers of leverage upon leverage\u201d). This cuts two ways: when things turn sideways, they implode. But a good call can lead to massive payouts.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, is Masa buying in at the end of the cycle?\n\nSoftBank\u2019s famous for a few spectacular blow-ups. WeWork\u2019s valuation plummeted after it had to scrap its IPO plan (and then later, filed for bankruptcy). SoftBank\u2019s ties and backing of Greensill Capital also ended in disaster.\n\nSo, for a few years, Masa has kept under the radar, licking his wounds while building up a strong conviction that AI would be the centrepiece of his next great set of investments.\n\nAnd the spigot of massive tech investments has once again opened up, coaxing him to make a big dice roll.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s one of just four investors who have pledged a total of $100bn to fund Stargate, a major new data centre project unveiled last week. (Others backing the project touted by President Donald Trump include Oracle, Abu Dhabi state fund MGX and OpenAI.)\n\nThe ties between OpenAI and SoftBank are multiplying quickly. The new potential $25bn investment would cover the latter\u2019s commitment to the US infrastructure project, according to several people familiar with the plans.\n\nWhen it comes to bets on AI, Masa has had some good luck so far. His investment in Arm \u2014 of which SoftBank\u2019s still the majority shareholder \u2014 has made him a fortune, with the stock trebling since going public.\n\nThis has given him a new stockpile of assets to leverage in every which way to seed his bets. Such firepower has historically become a fount of entertainment for Wall Street, or just good drama.\n\nPlease join DD in pulling up a seat with some popcorn and a stiff drink in hand, because our boy\u2019s officially back.\n\nJust before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, the scion of Italy\u2019s billionaire Agnelli family John Elkann joined a swelling list of high-powered executives to visit the returning US president.\n\nAs ever with Trump, a deal was on the cards. Days later, the Dodge and Jeep maker Stellantis, which Elkann chairs, committed to invest $5bn across its US car factories.\n\nThe move is part of Elkann\u2019s plan to turn around the struggling carmaker, after the company parted ways with charismatic but uncompromising chief executive Carlos Tavares last month.\n\nStellantis\u2019s share price has cratered in the past year as it has struggled with a shortfall in demand for its cars. Tavares\u2019s unrelenting style also damaged relations, not least with US dealers saddled with high-priced vehicles they were unable to shift.\n\nSince Tavares\u2019s departure, Elkann has jetted across Europe to improve relations with the leaders of Italy, France and the EU, cancelled lay-offs in the US and refreshed Stellantis\u2019s management teams.\n\nHis visit to Trump may prove the most important step yet in his strategic reset.\n\nBeyond the $5bn investment, Elkann is betting that he can use Trump\u2019s EV scepticism and deregulation push to Stellantis\u2019s advantage.\n\nHe told Trump he would back the new administration\u2019s shift away from Joe Biden\u2019s EV targets. The carmaker will launch a number of new models in 2025, across hybrid, electric and petrol formats.\n\nWhile Elkann may have won Trump\u2019s favour, there are challenges ahead. The company continues to supply the US from Canada and Mexico, who are both threatened with tariffs.\n\nAnd whoever Elkann chooses as Stellantis\u2019s next chief executive will face the same challenges as the rest of the car industry: increasing competition from China and a long-term slowdown in new car sales.\n\nBlackstone, the world\u2019s largest alternative manager, is flexing its muscles again after enduring a test when interest rates soared in 2022, causing many investors to sell their investments in its massive property fund, Breit.\n\nIt\u2019s on the offensive again after raising $171bn and investing $134bn in 2024, not far off the New York-based group\u2019s activity in 2021 when chief executive Stephen Schwarzman professed an \u201cout of body experience\u201d as cash sloshed around freely.\n\nIn its fourth-quarter results, Blackstone\u2019s relatively nascent infrastructure business emerged as a driver of better than expected returns.\n\nIts $43bn perpetual infrastructure fund soared about 20 per cent for the year, lifting its fee-related performance revenues by $1.2bn, or 728 per cent, from the same time in 2023.\n\nAt the helm of Blackstone\u2019s infrastructure unit is a rising star inside the group who was name-checked by Schwarzman in front of shareholders on Thursday.\n\nIn 2017, Sean Klimczak was tasked with getting Blackstone on the map in infrastructure, an area where non-US groups such as Brookfield, Macquarie and EQT dominate. The efforts didn\u2019t start off swimmingly \u2014 a Saudi Arabia-backed effort initially stalled.\n\nMeanwhile, independent infrastructure investment outfits including Global Infrastructure Partners and Stonepeak, which had been spun out of Blackstone, had their assets soar.\n\nBut Blackstone\u2019s now collected $55bn in infrastructure assets and believes it has positioned itself to be a major player. It has been bolstered by winning investments such as gas export pioneer Cheniere Energy Partners and data centre operator QTS.\n\nSchwarzman said the toils of building businesses internally carry \u201csignificant economic benefits as compared to a strategy of bolt-on acquisitions\u201d, an apparent reference to a wave of infrastructure-related deals such as BlackRock\u2019s $12.5bn takeover of GIP last year.\n\nSpace lasers Donald Trump has ordered work on a defence shield that goes beyond Ronald Reagan\u2019s famed \u201cStar Wars\u201d programme, the FT reports.\n\nDeutsche\u2019s woes For much of the past 15 years, the only thing consistent about Deutsche Bank was its ability to step on every rake it encountered, Lex writes.

The agency late on Thursday said it had recovered the voice and data recorders from the jet, though the helicopter\u2019s were still in the water.\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s speculation regarding the cause of the crash, Jennifer Homendy, the agency\u2019s chair, earlier on Thursday said: \u201cWe do not know enough facts to be able to rule in or out human factor, mechanical factors.\u201d\n\nTrump, who was flanked by his vice-president and newly sworn-in secretaries of defence and transportation, began his remarks with an appeal for unity in \u201ca moment of anguish\u201d, when \u201cthe differences between Americans fade to nothing\u201d.\n\nBut he quickly launched into a political attack against Democrats, saying that ex-presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had lowered standards for who was allowed to qualify to be an air traffic controller.\n\n\u201cI put safety first, Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and their politics was even worse.\u201d\n\nHe said that \u201cfor an air traffic controller, we want the brightest, the smartest, the sharpest. We want somebody that\u2019s psychologically superior,\u201d adding that \u201cI don\u2019t think\u201d people with \u201csevere disabilities\u201d should be air traffic controllers.\n\nAfter appearing to blame air traffic controllers for the accident, he then turned his attention to the crew of the Black Hawk.\n\n\u201cYou had a pilot problem from the standpoint of the helicopter, because it was visual. It was very clear night\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the American Airlines plane had lights blazing,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cI have helicopters. You can stop a helicopter very quickly. It had the ability to go up or down, had the ability to turn, and the turn it made was not the correct one,\u201d he added.\n\nUS defence officials said the Black Hawk was being flown by an experienced crew on routine training.\n\nTrump said investigators were trying to determine whether the troops were using night vision equipment, which \u201cmay change your view\u201d from the cockpit. A defence official said the army could not confirm whether the crew was wearing the night vision goggles.\n\nDefence secretary Pete Hegseth said the three soldiers in the helicopter \u201cwere on a routine annual night flight retraining on a standard corridor for a continuity of government mission\u201d.\n\n\u201cTragically, last night, a mistake was made\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009there was some sort of an elevation issue that we have immediately begun investigating at the DoD and army level,\u201d he said, adding that what happened was \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d.\n\nUS Army aviation expert John Koziol said that given the flight crew\u2019s experience, \u201cthis should not have been a problem knowing exactly where they were at\u201d.\n\nHe called the corridor \u201crelatively easy to fly\u201d and said the helicopter\u2019s route was flown on a near daily basis by army and other government aircraft.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, officials said 28 bodies had been recovered from the American flight and one body from the Black Hawk.\n\nTrump said Russian citizens were aboard the flight and the US would facilitate the repatriation of their bodies. There has been no direct air travel between the US and Russia since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSerious aviation accidents are rare in the US.

But other experts insist\u00a0there are good reasons to think the devastating pathogen emerged from a market where animals are traded.\n\nBeijing has never fully co-operated with international investigators, impeding the search for a definitive answer. But scientists continue their quest to establish the causes of a global health crisis that killed millions of people, caused trillions of dollars of economic damage and increased fears over the risks of virus research.\n\nThe CIA said on Saturday that the Sars-Cov-2 coronavirus was \u201cmore likely\u201d to have a \u201cresearch-related\u201d origin than a natural one.\n\nBut the CIA said it had \u201clow confidence\u201d in its conclusion, which came after its new director John Ratcliffe took office and urged the agency to \u201cget off the sidelines\u201d in its analysis of the pathogen\u2019s origins. Its assessment gave no indications of having drawn on new intelligence and was the product of a review ordered by the Biden administration near the end of its time in office.\n\nThe CIA\u2019s statement is the latest from US politicians and agencies that lean towards the lab leak theory. Some Republican lawmakers have used the hypothesis as part of a broader critique of China\u2019s handling of the outbreak. Beijing has denied that either the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a leading centre for coronavirus research, or the Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control were the initial virus source.\n\nAsked about the CIA statement this week, China\u2019s foreign ministry said the US should \u201cstop politicising and weaponising origins-tracing\u201d.\n\nMany authorities internationally have yet to take a strong position on Covid\u2019s origins, while stressing that they back World Health Organization efforts to establish it. The UK\u2019s health ministry said a \u201crobust, transparent and science-led review\u201d would \u201cbetter prevent\u201d future pandemics.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s relations with Beijing deteriorated when Chinese officials did not allow the health body to probe Covid\u2019s origins thoroughly. This month the organisation said it was a \u201cmoral and scientific imperative\u201d for China to offer the necessary data and access.\n\nIts advocates believe that if a potent new coronavirus appears in a city that was a centre for research into such pathogens, then a lab was probably the origin.\n\nThe Wuhan institute\u2019s work reflected a growing focus on the threat posed by diseases of animal origin. Such zoonotic coronaviruses are thought to have caused the Sars and Mers outbreaks in 2002 and 2012. The institute sometimes worked with US partners on US government-funded projects, such as 2015 \u201cgain-of-function\u201d experiments that made coronaviruses deadlier for research purposes.\n\nThe lab leak idea has spawned various sub-theories. One is that Sars-Cov-2 was being investigated by researchers having been gathered from a bat or other wild animal. Another is that the pathogen was created by modifying a natural coronavirus. This could have been done either by a process of artificially accelerated evolution known as serial passaging, or by genetic engineering.\n\nProponents of the lab leak hypothesis acknowledge the lack of supporting proof but argue this is impossible to gather without Chinese co-operation.\n\n\u201cThere is not a smoking gun, but there\u2019s a gun laying on the table and it\u2019s warm to the touch,\u201d said Jamie Metzl, a former member of a WHO advisory committee on genome editing. \u201cThere is all of this circumstantial evidence.\u201d\n\nMany scientists still favour a scenario that Covid, like other coronaviruses, emerged in animals and then passed to humans. According to this model, the likely starting point was contact between wild creatures and humans in a Wuhan wet market where early Covid cases were identified.\n\nThe theory found support in research published last year on environmental samples taken from Huanan Seafood Market in the central Chinese city in January 2020. It pinpointed a stall where all the Sars-Cov-2 positive swabs contained traces of wildlife DNA too, showing both animals and virus were present at the same location. The samples included genetic material from species such as raccoon dogs, civets and bamboo rats. All these creatures had been identified as\u00a0possible sources of virus transmission to humans.\n\n\u201cMultiple plausible intermediate hosts of Sars-Cov-2 were present at the exact site within Wuhan to which Covid-19 was first epidemiologically linked,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nCritics allege the market origin theory is flawed. They say it gives too little weight to reports of human Covid cases as early as November 2019. The market hypothesis also includes the contested suggestion that there were at least two separate spillover events there from animals to humans, helping seed an epidemic.\n\nThe scientists behind last year\u2019s study say neither of these points undermines the idea that the market was the source of Covid. They contend that Sars-Cov-2 genetic material in the January 2020 samples could have been deposited weeks before, consistent with the reports of Covid cases in November 2019. Professor Florence D\u00e9barre, an evolutionary biologist and co-author of the research, said a market origin was \u201clikely whether or not there were multiple spillovers\u201d.\n\nThe CIA had not provided corroborating information for its lab leak assessment, D\u00e9barre noted, adding:\u00a0\u201cI hope that the data and logic leading to the conclusion of the various elements of the US intelligence community will one day be made public.\u201d\n\nGain of function research involves manipulating pathogens to probe their behaviour by enhancing properties such as transmissibility and ability to cause disease. The work may be done for valid reasons such as development of vaccines or other ways to combat emerging pathogens.\n\nBut the rules governing its research remain patchy, with no international governance regime in place.\n\nLast year the US government tightened rules on gain of function research. Some experts argue the revised rules, which were weakened from an initial plan that some scientists warned could hobble work on less hazardous pathogens, have troubling gaps.\n\nThe focus on federally funded research pays insufficient attention to non-federally financed work and experiments on novel pathogens, said Alina Chan, a viral vector engineer at MIT and Harvard\u2019s Broad Institute.\n\n\u201cThe prediction of pandemic risk arising from novel experiments is difficult even for multidisciplinary teams of experts, and a self-reporting system is inadequate as evidenced by past incidents,\u201d Chan wrote in a paper published last month.\n\nUS politicians such as Senator Rand Paul have long called for closer scrutiny of gain of function research.

Three people familiar with the situation said some intelligence analysts had dubbed the project \u201cBeijing Military City\u201d.\n\nThe construction comes as the People\u2019s Liberation Army develops new weapons and projects ahead of the force\u2019s centenary in 2027. US intelligence said President Xi Jinping had also ordered the PLA to have developed the capability to attack Taiwan by then.\n\nThe PLA is also rapidly expanding its nuclear weapons arsenal and working to better integrate its different branches. Military experts believe the PLA\u2019s lack of integration is among its biggest weaknesses compared with the US armed forces.\n\n\u201cIf confirmed, this new advanced underground command bunker for the military leadership, including President Xi as the chairman of the Central Military Commission, signals Beijing\u2019s intent to build not only a world-class conventional force but also an advanced nuclear warfighting capability,\u201d said Dennis Wilder, the former head of China analysis for the CIA.\n\nThe Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the US intelligence community, did not comment on the project. The Chinese embassy in Washington said it was \u201cnot aware of the details\u201d but stressed that China was \u201ccommitted to the path of peaceful development and a defence policy that is defensive in nature\u201d.\n\nRenny Babiarz,\u00a0a former imagery analyst at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency who has analysed imagery of the area, said there were at least 100 cranes working over a 5 sq km area developing underground infrastructure.\n\n\u201cImagery analysis suggests the construction of several possible underground facilities linked via possible underground passageways, although additional data and information is needed to more fully assess this construction,\u201d said Babiarz, now vice-president of analysis and operations at AllSource Analysis, a geospatial analysis service group.\n\nThe site was busy with construction activity earlier this month, in contrast to a dearth of development in most big real estate projects in China, which has been gripped by a property sector crisis. There were no showrooms typically associated with a commercial real estate project. Unusually for a commercial project, there are no official mentions of the construction site on the internet in Chinese.\n\nWhile there was no visible military presence at the site, there were signs warning against flying drones or taking photographs.\u00a0Guards at one gate abruptly said that entry was prohibited and refused to talk about the project. One supervisor leaving the construction site refused to comment on the project.\n\nAccess to the back of the project has been blocked by a checkpoint. A guard said the public could not access popular hiking and tourist areas near the site, which a local shopkeeper described as a\u00a0\u201cmilitary area\u201d.\n\nOne former senior US intelligence official said that while the PLA\u2019s current headquarters in central Beijing was fairly new it was not designed to be a secure combat command centre.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s main secure command centre is in the Western Hills, north-east of the new facility, and was built decades ago at the height of the cold war,\u201d said the former official. \u201cThe size, scale and partially buried characteristics of the new facility suggest it will replace the Western Hills complex as the primary wartime command facility.\n\n\u201cChinese leaders may judge that the new facility will enable greater security against US \u2018bunker buster\u2019 munitions, and even against nuclear weapons,\u201d the former intelligence official added. \u201cIt can also incorporate more advanced and secure communications and have room for expanding PLA capabilities and missions.\u201d\n\nOne China researcher familiar with the images said the site had \u201call the hallmarks of a sensitive military facility\u201d, including heavily reinforced concrete and deep underground tunnelling.\n\n\u201cNearly 10 times bigger than the Pentagon, it\u2019s fitting for Xi Jinping\u2019s ambitions to surpass the US,\u201d said the researcher. \u201cThis fortress only serves one purpose, which is to act as a doomsday bunker for China\u2019s increasingly sophisticated and capable military.\u201d\n\nThe construction of the site comes amid a multi-year redevelopment of Beijing\u2019s western outskirts. But there has been speculation online in China about why houses in the Qinglonghu area were being razed.\n\nIn one post on Baidu Zhidao, the Chinese search engine\u2019s equivalent of Quora, one user said: \u201cAre they going to build the Chinese Pentagon in Qinglonghu?\u201d\n\nTwo people close to Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry also said the PLA appeared to be building a new command centre, though some experts questioned if the area was suitable for underground bunkers.\n\n\u201cThe land area is much larger than a normal military camp and military school, so it can only be assumed that it is a site for an administrative organisation or a large training base,\u201d said Hsu Yen-chi, a researcher at the Council on Strategic and Wargaming Studies think-tank in Taipei.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f3763e51-8607-42b9-9ef9-5789d5bf353d"}, {"uuid4": "f2da979d-1c21-4cb2-a707-93c7dd0b0a17", "title": "OpenAI says it has evidence China\u2019s DeepSeek used its model to train competitor", "description": "White House AI tsar David Sacks raises possibility of alleged intellectual property theft", "author": "Eleanor Olcott", "published_date": "2025-01-29T07:08:41.382Z", "content": "OpenAI says it has found evidence that Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek used the US company\u2019s proprietary models to train its own open-source competitor, as concerns grow over a potential breach of intellectual property.\n\nThe San Francisco-based ChatGPT maker told the Financial Times it had seen some evidence of \u201cdistillation\u201d, which it suspects to be from DeepSeek.\n\nThe technique is used by developers to obtain better performance on smaller models by using outputs from larger, more capable ones, allowing them to achieve similar results on specific tasks at a much lower cost.\n\nDistillation is a common practice in the industry but the concern was that DeepSeek may be doing it to build its own rival model, which is a breach of OpenAI\u2019s terms of service.\n\n\u201cThe issue is when you [take it out of the platform and] are doing it to create your own model for your own purposes,\u201d said one person close to OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment further or provide details of its evidence.

Its built-on-a-shoestring models have attained high rankings and comparable results to leading US models.\n\nShares in Nvidia fell 17 per cent on Monday, wiping $589bn off its market value, on fears that big investments in its expensive AI hardware might not be needed. They recovered by 9 per cent on Tuesday, along with other tech stocks.\n\nOpenAI and its partner Microsoft investigated accounts believed to be DeepSeek\u2019s last year that were using OpenAI\u2019s application programming interface (API) and blocked their access on suspicion of distillation that violated the terms of service, another person with direct knowledge said. These investigations were first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this detail. DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment made during the lunar new year holiday.\n\nEarlier, President Donald Trump\u2019s AI and crypto tsar David Sacks said \u201cit is possible\u201d that IP theft had occurred.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a technique in AI called distillation\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009when one model learns from another model [and] kind of sucks the knowledge out of the parent model,\u201d Sacks told Fox News on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI models, and I don\u2019t think OpenAI is very happy about this,\u201d Sacks added, although he did not provide evidence.\n\nDeepSeek said it used just 2,048 Nvidia H800 graphics cards and spent $5.6mn to train its V3 model with 671bn parameters, a fraction of what OpenAI and Google spent to train comparably sized models. Some experts said the model generated responses that indicated it had been trained on outputs from OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, which would violate its terms of service.\n\nIndustry insiders say that it is common practice for AI labs in China and the US to use outputs from companies such as OpenAI, which have invested in hiring people to teach their models how to produce responses that sound more human. This is expensive and labour-intensive, and smaller players often piggyback off this work, say the insiders.\n\n\u201cIt is a very common practice for start-ups and academics to use outputs from human-aligned commercial LLMs, like ChatGPT, to train another model,\u201d said Ritwik Gupta, a PhD candidate in AI at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\u201cThat means you get this human feedback step for free. It is not surprising to me that DeepSeek supposedly would be doing the same. If they were, stopping this practice precisely may be difficult,\u201d he added.\n\nThe practice highlights the difficulty for companies keen to protect their technical edge. \u201cWe know [China]-based companies \u2014 and others \u2014 are constantly trying to distil the models of leading US AI companies,\u201d OpenAI said in its latest statement.\n\nIt added: \u201cWe engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models, and believe\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.\u201d\n\nOpenAI is battling allegations of its own copyright infringement from newspapers and content creators, including lawsuits from The New York Times and prominent authors, who accuse the company of training its models on their articles and books without permission.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a0dfedd1-5255-4fa9-8ccc-1fe01de87ea6"}, {"uuid4": "67011368-c059-4b6c-a103-60127396f716", "title": "Beijing-backed lending boosts China\u2019s dominance in clean energy minerals", "description": "Entities loaned billions to create mining and processing supply chain, report shows", "author": "Haohsiang Ko", "published_date": "2025-01-28T22:00:46.585Z", "content": "China has built up control of critical minerals across the developing world over the course of two decades through a network of at least 26 state-backed financial institutions, according to a new report that traces the country\u2019s financing strategy.\n\nResearch published on Wednesday found that Chinese policy and commercial banks \u2014 working alongside private Chinese entities and some non-Chinese groups \u2014 issued loans worth nearly $57bn from 2000 to 2021 in 19 low- and middle-income countries for mining and processing copper, cobalt, nickel, lithium and rare earths, components critical to clean energy technologies such as electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.\n\nThe study by AidData at the College of William & Mary in the US, which was reviewed by the Financial Times, attempts to capture the extent of China\u2019s financing of extractive projects in the developing world. The research highlights the scale of the challenge faced by the west in countering China\u2019s control of the global supply chain for emerging green-tech industries.\n\n\u201cGiven that China\u2019s financing model enables its companies to outmanoeuvre competitors in capital-intensive mineral sectors, its rivals need to develop more compelling and competitive financing arrangements that are responsive to the preferences of host countries,\u201d said Brooke Escobar, who leads AidData\u2019s Chinese development finance programme.\n\nThe research shows that more than three-quarters of China\u2019s state-backed transition mineral financing \u2014 via both debt and equity \u2014 in the developing world was channelled to projects where Chinese entities held ownership stakes in joint ventures and special purpose vehicles.\n\nThese entities have long-term control over the extraction and processing of strategic mineral deposits, including copper from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru as well as Indonesia\u2019s nickel and Argentina\u2019s lithium reserves.\n\nThe data was compiled from the loan recipients and is rarely disclosed by Chinese financial institutions.\n\nChina\u2019s transition minerals financing differs from Beijing\u2019s traditional lending practices in the infrastructure-focused Belt and Road Initiative, one of President Xi Jinping\u2019s hallmark foreign development policies, the AidData researchers argued.\n\nUnlike most loans made for BRI projects, which are dominated by a handful of Chinese development banks, the network of lenders to the mineral sector was much broader.\n\nBeijing\u2019s state-owned commercial banks, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and Citic, play the largest role.\n\nHowever, a much larger network of 86 entities, including 26 Chinese official sector entities as well as scores of private Chinese companies and some non-Chinese financiers, also provided financing alongside Chinese state-backed participants in syndicated loans. This represents a much more diversified creditor base than traditional BRI lending.\n\nICBC, BoC and Citic did not respond to requests for comment on the data, nor did seven other large Chinese banks contacted by the FT.\n\nThe minerals lending also mostly involved serial lending, rather than one-off loans, in contrast to the BRI. State lenders initially provided an acquisition loan to help a Chinese company gain an ownership stake in a mine, before further credit facilities were extended for development and to provide working capital.\n\nThe BRI has also been marred by the issue of low-income countries struggling to repay hundreds of billions of dollars and allegations of \u201cdebt trap diplomacy\u201d after a spate of sovereign debt defaults.\n\nBut AidData showed that about one-quarter of China\u2019s mineral lending was backed by a Chinese guarantor, compared with an estimated 4 per cent in Beijing\u2019s broader overseas lending portfolio, reflecting an increased emphasis on risk mitigation and safeguarding investment returns.\n\nThe lending was mostly targeted at upstream resource extraction, AidData said. This helped secure China\u2019s access to raw materials, creating a vertically integrated Chinese-controlled supply chain, while avoiding competing with its own domestic mineral processing industry.\n\nThe data showed that two-thirds of the financing went into JVs or SPVs where the host government held no significant level of ownership. Bypassing local governments reduced those countries\u2019 financial liabilities but also potentially limited their access to future financial returns, the researchers noted.\n\nChina\u2019s dominance in many cleantech sectors is expected to expand over the next 10 years, forecasts suggested, despite the US and Europe handing out hundreds of billions of dollars in industrial subsidies as well as rising protectionism via tariffs and bans on Chinese-made products.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9419aa64-33ce-4ed5-ba97-7d0aebbeb48f"}, {"uuid4": "b841f30e-982f-48a8-b7eb-17b610030af2", "title": "China\u2019s emboldened AI industry releases flurry of model updates", "description": "Success of DeepSeek inspires confidence as latest products are pushed out ahead of lunar new year holiday", "author": "Eleanor Olcott", "published_date": "2025-01-28T09:36:13.382Z", "content": "Chinese artificial intelligence groups have been rushing out model updates before the lunar new year holiday, as the world wakes up to the sector\u2019s major advances led by start-up DeepSeek in the face of US chip restrictions.\n\nOn Monday, the eve of China\u2019s most important annual holiday, the Hangzhou-based company released a new open-source model for image generation, cementing its reputation as the disrupter-in-chief in a field previously dominated by US giants.

But this is giving them confidence that they can catch up,\u201d said one AI investor in China.\n\nDeepSeek has captured the world\u2019s attention with a series of model releases that show similar performance to those of US rivals such as OpenAI and Meta, even though it claims to have a fraction of the computing resources and is blocked from acquiring the latest Nvidia processors by US export restrictions. Last week, it released its R1 reasoning model, an advanced model that rivals OpenAI\u2019s o1 and can automatically learn and improve itself without human supervision.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek has injected a lot of energy into China\u2019s AI players and, more broadly, into the global open-source AI community that will use its findings from its R1 paper to make progress on reasoning models,\u201d said Wang Tiezhen, an engineer at AI research hub Hugging Face.\n\nThis week, investors dumped AI-related stocks, with Nvidia losing almost $600bn in market value on Monday. They were reacting to Chinese breakthroughs that show it is possible to build powerful models while pursuing a different strategy to the US one of building ever-larger computing clusters to get ahead in the AI race.\n\nOn Monday, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen released Qwen2.5-1M, a series of new models that are capable of handling longer inputs, an important development that would mean the model could be deployed for AI agent applications with higher memory demands, according to Wang.\n\nOn the same day, DeepSeek released Janus-Pro, a text-to-image generation model that it claims can surpass state of the art ones from competitors such as OpenAI\u2019s Dall-E 3 and Stability AI\u2019s Stable Diffusion 3 on some benchmarks.\n\nZhipu, valued at its last funding round in December at $3bn, last week released an update to GLM-PC. The AI agent model is aimed at enterprise customers, enabling computers to automatically complete tasks such as filling out forms or digesting financial reports.\n\nWhile Zhipu has not courted much attention for its LLM development, it has a lead among local AI start-ups in commercialising its technology, with support from local governments and state-owned enterprises that have partnered with the Beijing-based company to deploy its models.\n\nLast week, another Beijing-based start-up Moonshot, which owns the popular AI chatbot Kimi, updated its reasoning model to Kimi k1.5, demonstrating strong results compared with established AI models for complex reasoning tasks. The latest release can process texts and images while handling long and complex queries.\n\nIt is standard practice for Chinese tech companies to release products before the long holiday, with the added benefit that potential customers with lots of free time during the break can test and explore them.\n\nOnce Chinese AI players return from their break, the race is on to become the leading player developing AI applications for commercial use. \u201cIf AI agents can create dramatic commercial value, one or two of the LLM players have a chance to transform into a new generation of software companies,\u201d the AI investor said.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/036cb510-5cf2-4dd8-9aec-1341396dfc2a"}, {"uuid4": "ade97983-91d2-4cfa-9957-5cac5345d58b", "title": "A young couple paid for a luxury maternity home.

But beds at the YueGe post-partum confinement centre filled up quickly. The room wasn\u2019t cheap, at Rmb150,000, or about $21,000, for 28 days. But unlike a normal hotel, it came with its own team of professional nurses and nannies. They would observe the new mother and her baby during the day and help with feeds at night. Twice a week, a doctor would check on the mother\u2019s recovery. Meals would be tailored to her needs. At such a life-changing moment, there would be nothing for the new parents to worry about.\n\nEmma and Alan had looked at several centres in Shanghai, but YueGe\u2019s stood out. Online reviews raved, saying even the staff were well treated. They\u2019d spoken to a manager, Wang, for two hours and been impressed. It helped that his boss, Liang, was from Taiwan, where the tradition of confinement had first emerged as a modern industry.\n\nEmma is 34 and works in finance. Her friends were \u201call doing it\u201d too, but that wasn\u2019t the reason she found the idea of confinement so attractive. Nor had she immediately thought about the health benefits of the ancient practice, such as the need to avoid the cold of the wind entering your bones (a risk even at the height of summer). It was just appealing, the thought of having so many people to look after you. Plus, if she stayed at home, as her parents\u2019 generation did, the excited new grandparents would end up moving into the couple\u2019s two-bedroom apartment. They would \u201cinterfere\u201d, and there would be all kinds of family conflict. No, in the confinement centre, she would be in charge.\n\nIn return for a discount, Emma and Alan agreed to pay upfront. At YueGe, the care was so attentive that a chat group was set up just for them, with seven or eight members of staff in it. The couple also attended three lectures at the site. But one Sunday in March, just two months before their baby was due, they received a strange message.\n\nPurportedly sent by staff at the centre, the message explained in vague language that YueGe had undergone \u201cstructural changes\u201d that were \u201cbeyond the authority and scope of the staff\u201d. It\u00a0went on to say the staff\u2019s own wages were also in arrears, and they would take legal action. The message added that any other questions would need to be directed towards the managers Wang and Liang, who were copied in. It also listed another company: Beikang.\n\nAlan and Emma didn\u2019t know what had happened, but the implication was clear: YueGe had run out of money, including their advance payment, and there would be no month of confinement.\n\nEmma\u2019s first response was to go on to the internet, where she now came across rumblings of discontent about the centre. She also found a QR code of the kind that is common in China. It allowed the couple to enter into a WeChat weiquanqun, or \u201cgroup for the protection of rights\u201d. It was already full of other parents-to-be. \u201cWe realised,\u201d says Alan, \u201cthat this was a very serious matter.\u201d\n\nThe concept of \u201crights protection\u201d has its roots, including a sense of powerlessness in the courts, in the legal code that emerged in China following the end of strict communism in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, it is most associated with the risks facing consumers who experience gyms closing midway through their contracts or property investment schemes going awry. While many see no option but to show up at the doors of the business itself seeking redress, social media has given aggrieved consumers somewhere to organise themselves.\n\nEveryone in the newly created chat group had received the same vague text message, naming the two managers of YueGe. Wang was the manager who had met Alan and Emma. Liang\u2019s Taiwanese nationality was, as one of few salient facts available, a focus for suspicion. \u201cWe need to stop Liang from fleeing to Taiwan,\u201d wrote one user, echoing a widely held concern in mainland China over insiders absconding with company funds. But if that did happen, said another user, all might not be lost: \u201cThey hold people accountable [there], more than we can in the mainland.\u201d\n\nSome scrutinised the timing of the discounts people had been offered. \u201cMr Liang urged us to pay on November 26, and his WeChat moments stopped updating on November 28,\u201d wrote one user. More messages emerged, indicating that in February, further discounts had been offered in return for full payment upfront, seemingly to plug some kind of cash shortage. \u201cThe Taiwanese guy called me and said the same thing, full payment before the Lantern festival.\u201d \u201cPremeditated,\u201d said another user, in the absence of any other explanations. (The FT was unable to contact either Liang or Wang.)\n\nEmma and Alan were content to quietly observe the discussion in the WeChat group, not wanting to draw attention to themselves. Besides, it was almost impossible to be sure who was sharing information. Despite the participants being Chinese, most of their usernames were in English or interspersed with emojis \u2014 not unusual in an internet environment where people often seek to obscure their identity.\n\nThe question of who could help was similarly unclear. One user had gone to the China Consumers Association, but it told him to contact the Health Bureau which, it claimed, regulated post-partum confinement centres. \u201cAre there any friends here who understand the law?\u201d he asked in bewilderment. Another claimed to be at a police station, where officers said that they could not file a case. Instead the advice was to go to the head office of the relevant company.\n\nIn the absence of clear identities, people were mainly distinguished by how much noise they made. The most prominent voice belonged to a user whose name included a bee emoji, and who claimed to \u201cspecialise in complaints\u201d. When it came to the art of protecting rights, she was a natural, recalled Alan. She too had contacted the police, who told her this was a contract dispute, and nothing to do with them.\n\n\u201cThe first thing the policeman said to me,\u201d she wrote on the Sunday the group was formed, was: \u201cAre you just one person, or are there a lot of you?\u201d \u201cIt was then that I understood,\u201d she continued, \u201cthat as just one person, he didn\u2019t care at all.\u201d\n\nBut with around 100 people now claiming to be victims, there was growing hope of recovery. Bee emoji suggested the group find a time to report the incident together. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t getting your money,\u201d she told them, \u201cit\u2019s because you aren\u2019t making enough noise.\u201d\n\nDespite their widespread confidence in the Taiwan theory, by Monday, the group\u2019s focus had begun to shift to the other company named in the original message, Beikang, which they mostly referred to as Saint Bella, the brand name for which it is best known. The company, launched by 38-year-old entrepreneur Xiang Hua in 2017, describes itself as \u201ca family care group with a leading post-partum care and recovery operation\u201d, and in 2023 had revenues of Rmb560mn, the second biggest from post-partum centres in China that year. Last year, it launched an IPO application in Hong Kong.\n\nThe company has a network of 72 \u201cpremium post-partum centers\u201d, including one in Los Angeles which opened last year. It has also made a series of acquisitions. In December 2022, it carried out due diligence on the parent company of YueGe, called YueZiGe (a play on the Chinese word for confinement). The purchase of YueZiGe went through in February 2024, just a month before Emma and Alan received the news about their confinement centre.\n\nFor those who still had no idea what had happened to their money, Saint Bella now seemed to offer the best hope of compensation. Some in the group focused on the company\u2019s indirect ownership stake in YueGe. Its potential vulnerability to negative publicity was also weighed, given the impending IPO. (One user referred to a complaints page on the Hong Kong stock exchange, another suggested exposing those responsible on a nationwide TV gala held on world consumer rights day.) Further suspicion was aroused when it was noted that online posts mentioning the company in relation to the scandal had been \u201charmonised\u201d \u2014 a euphemism in China for deleted online content.\n\nMeanwhile, members of the group were increasingly heading to confinement sites in person in the hope of finding and confronting responsible parties. That Monday evening, one user claimed to be at the YueGe site where Alan and Emma first visited. \u201cBoss Wang and Boss Liang are here,\u201d she wrote, and Saint Bella was on its way.\n\nAt 6.04pm, another user posted a livestream link from the site on Xiaohongshu, a social media platform with over 300 million users, to the group. In an environment used to highly sophisticated online censorship, what happened next still sowed confusion.\n\n\u201cHas the stream finished?\u201d someone asked a quarter of an hour later, at 6.20pm. \u201cIt\u2019s been taken down,\u201d another replied.\n\nThe link was posted twice more, at 6.23pm and 6.31pm. On both occasions it lasted only a few minutes before apparently being taken down.\n\nAt 6.34pm, the link was posted one final time. Five minutes later another user posted: \u201cIt\u2019s been turned off?\u201d\n\nFor those watching, any hope of finding answers live from the confinement site had been frustrated. But Emma and Alan were beginning to notice something strange. The people who made the most noise soon became very quiet, and those who went to the sites \u201cdidn\u2019t tell us anything\u201d after they came back.\n\nBy Tuesday, with few other options available, Emma decided the only possible course of action left was to make a scene of her own. In\u00a0another \u201crights protection\u201d WeChat group she had joined, she proposed heading to the same confinement site with red protest banners with white characters, in the style of those used to display government slogans. Within two hours, as though someone was watching closely, her phone rang. It was Saint Bella, with a simple message:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d\n\nThe office building where they met Saint Bella near Shanghai\u2019s Nanjing West Road looked rundown, said Alan. \u201cYou simply couldn\u2019t believe it\u2019s the same company if you compare it with the post-partum centres.\u201d\n\nFrom the start, 48 hours earlier, his reaction to the entire affair had been to comfort his pregnant wife, and to avoid showing too much emotion. That Tuesday morning, before they were invited to the meeting, he had been to the police station on his own. As expected, he found no legal solution. But he had encountered some other parents-to-be there, some of whom said they had negotiated a deal with Saint Bella, and he was afraid of missing out.\n\nOn the WeChat group there were also rumours that some, after protesting on site, had received an offer of a 40 per cent refund, a free nanny during their confinement month at home, and meal delivery. Others suggested there was another choice: discounts on rooms in other centres that the company ran in Shanghai, if they were willing to pay again. The claims attracted suspicion. One user deployed the term shui jun, referring to someone who is paid to post online, in response to a user who linked to an article about compensation.\n\nWord of behind-the-scenes offers also exposed a disunity among the largely anonymous group. Saint Bella is \u201ccrossing the river by feeling each stone\u201d, posted someone, referring to a famous quote from former leader of China, Deng Xiaoping. \u201cIt is dealing with you one by one, defeating you one by one, so that you will not gather together or post on social media.\u201d \u201cSomething I just don\u2019t understand,\u201d added one user, \u201cis if the two Taiwanese managers did this, and SBL completely didn\u2019t know about it, why haven\u2019t they sued them?\u201d (There is no indication Wang is Taiwanese.) \u201cThey definitely cannot not know about this,\u201d replied another.\n\nIn the office building, Emma and Alan sat around a table with five people, one of whom told them she represented all of the group\u2019s sites in Shanghai. There was one small window in the room, and the lights were extremely bright. The company was indeed offering them a 40 per cent refund, or a discount on a new centre. The woman claimed that because the company had only 30 per cent of the shares in the centre, this was more than it needed to offer. Alan, who like his wife works in finance, contested this. \u201cDon\u2019t think we are so easy to fool,\u201d he said. In his view, it was \u201csophistry\u201d. The woman got angry. \u201cWe can\u2019t rule out suing you directly,\u201d she said.\n\nAt this Alan said his emotions got the better of him. \u201cI usually pretend to be angry in negotiations,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I really was angry.\u201d The negotiation broke down. He slammed the table. In hindsight, his outburst proved helpful. It prompted an additional discount of Rmb40,000 on the new centre, though it would still cost the couple Rmb60,000 (about $8,200) on top of what they had spent already. The deal required them to sign a document saying they would not talk about Saint Bella in the media, on social media or in the rights group, nor would they take legal action against it. Saint Bella declined to comment on the meeting.\n\nAfter three hours, Alan and Emma left. There was another family waiting outside.\n\nThe following day, under the name Beikang International and referencing its Saint Bella brand, the company released a statement distancing itself from the operations of YueGe, the company at the centre of the controversy. Neither Emma nor Alan remembers seeing it specifically, though similar points emerged in the WeChat group.\n\nAccording to the company, it never intended to have any involvement with YueGe. Its connection came through a sprawl of subsidiaries typical of mainland China. The statement said that in February 2024 it had acquired a majority stake in YueZiGe, a post-partum centre business in Shanghai previously associated with a Taiwanese woman. But YueZiGe, in turn, owned a majority stake in a consultancy company, which in turn owned a majority stake in YueGe (the statement mentioned Liang by name as legal representative, but did not mention Wang). As a result, Beikang said it had a 23.35 per cent indirect stake in YueGe.\n\nAs a minority shareholder at the time of the incident, the company said it did \u201cnot bear any legal responsibility\u201d for YueGe\u2019s insolvency.\n\nSaint Bella\u2019s founder, Xiang Hua, declined to comment. But in a further statement provided to the FT, the company said it became aware of the incident with YueGe only after employees and clients, given public knowledge of the above stake, began to claim compensation from it.\n\nThe company said that \u201cdespite bearing no fault or responsibility for this incident\u201d, it \u201cprovided emergency support\u201d to affected customers, employees and matrons \u201cout of a sense of social responsibility\u201d.\n\nThe company declined to comment on the removal of online content. The official statement released in March, which hit out against \u201cfalse statements and malicious accusations\u201d, was later taken down from Xiaohongshu, the platform where it was initially published. \u201cWe removed the statement once the issue subsided to better focus on core business activities,\u201d the company said, adding it was still publicly available elsewhere.\n\nIt also said a loan from YueZiGe to YueGe was made in August 2023, before its acquisition of the former company was complete. It said the loan was unrelated to Beikang, and it was unaware of any operational issues at the time. After the incident arose, it said it sought assistance from regulatory authorities and had filed a lawsuit against YueGe to recover the loan. It said it no longer has any indirect stake.\n\nAs for what had given rise to the complaints of YueGe customers, the original statement had a simple explanation: \u201cpoor management\u201d.\n\nIn May, Emma gave birth to a daughter, Sherry. In line with the deal, she completed her post-partum confinement at another Shanghai site associated with Saint Bella. Part of a luxurious hotel, the brightly lit rooms at the site are full of green plants. A timetable of activities for mothers, including meditation, is propped up by the wall. Guests must spray their shoes and hands with disinfectant before entering. Emma and Alan said they were pleased with the experience.\n\nOne of the last discussions on the WeChat group was about how much money had been collectively involved, calculated through a list function. The total came to about Rmb4mn-5mn ($550,000 \u2014$690,000), an amount that might easily fly under the radar in terms of attracting wider attention. Local broadcast state media in Shanghai did cover the story, talk of which rippled through the city, though participants\u2019 faces were blurred out.\n\nThe group soon fell quiet, but intriguing messages occasionally trickled through, including a YueGe doctor\u2019s claim on March 13 that he had not been paid for eight months, since, he said, Beikang had become involved, and that in the eight years working with YueGe and YueZiGe prior to that, he had always been paid on time. The company did not comment on the post.\n\nThen, on March 26, a message appeared that was longer and more detailed than any that had come before. This poster alleged that he had reported the incident to the police on Monday March 11 2024, and had now received a reply: making reference to transfers between YueGe and YueZiGe, the police said no misappropriation of funds could be determined and no case could be filed.\n\nDespite this the poster claimed YueGe\u2019s operating funds were transferred out of the company through a loan agreement, including the last few deposits from parents-to-be, and that Wang and Liang had told him this at the time of the complaint. Owing to the \u201cequity arrangement\u201d, the poster suggested Saint Bella could remove money from its subsidiaries and offer compensation at a proportion of the amount. He added that the settlement agreement with Saint Bella had been signed by his wife, and did not bind him. \u201cThey\u2019ve done something beautiful,\u201d replied bee emoji.\n\nSaint Bella did not comment on the post in the rights group WeChat. But in its statement to the FT, the company said it won its case against YueGe over the August 2023 loan. It did not respond to requests about whether any of the funds were recovered, but provided screenshots of court documents from October 31 last year, which showed a Shanghai court ordered YueGe to repay a loan principal amount of Rmb2mn, as well as interest and damages.\n\nOne other party was absent from the conversation: the Taiwanese woman associated with YueZiGe. Could she have helped to resolve the situation at YueGe? In its statement to the FT, Saint Bella said the other shareholder was \u201cunable to participate due to illness\u201d. The FT was unable to contact the woman.\n\nIn Shanghai, there are no longer any signs of YueGe. The site Emma and Alan first visited is still a confinement centre, but on the 16th floor nurses now wear badges with the name Baby Bella, one of the Saint Bella group\u2019s several brands across the 25 cities in which it operates.\n\nSometimes Alan finds himself telling the story to friends and colleagues. One time he scrutinised the WeChat account of Wang, the manager who had so impressed them. He found only the vaguest of clues, a one-word signature. \u201cRensheng\u201d it said, a Chinese word meaning \u201clife\u201d, followed by five dots and a single question mark.\n\nThomas Hale is the FT\u2019s Shanghai correspondent.

The pressure on the 45-year-old billionaire ramped up further this month, after Washington sanctioned his other companies that design and source artificial intelligence processors.\n\nIt is not the first time that Zhan\u2019s ambitions to build China\u2019s answer to Nvidia have jeopardised his business empire. Bitmain was nearly undone five years ago by his heavy spending to develop AI chips, sparking a civil war with his co-founder for control of the company.\n\nWhile Bitmain continues to focus on crypto mining, Zhan subsequently shifted those AI chip efforts into Xiamen Sophgo Technologies, which along with 15 affiliates, was added to the US commerce department entity list this month.\n\nThe company\u2019s troubles began when an AI processor made by the world\u2019s premier chip fabricator, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, was found in a Huawei AI card, allegedly circumventing sanctions. TSMC began investigating if it was purchased by Sophgo.\n\nThe US said that Sophgo posed a risk of diversion to Huawei and alleged it was \u201cacting at the behest of Beijing\u201d to build up China\u2019s indigenous chip production.\n\nSophgo, Bitmain and Zhan did not respond to requests for comment. Sophgo has previously denied working with Huawei and Bitmain said it was not involved in the matter.\n\nTSMC declined to comment on customer relationships but said that, as a law-abiding company, it was committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations including export controls.\n\nZhan\u2019s latest challenges show the hurdles Chinese entrepreneurs face, particularly for those keen to make a mark in semiconductors, where the whiplash of US-China geopolitics has set back many of the country\u2019s most ambitious tech companies.\n\nPeople with knowledge of Sophgo\u2019s operations describe a number of semiconductor related business lines. They include designing in-house AI processors and central processing units for supercomputers, as well as sourcing cutting edge Nvidia graphics processing units for Chinese data centres.\n\nThe US blacklisting formally cuts Sophgo off from TSMC, and could potentially pose challenges for its partner Bitmain, which also relies on the Taiwanese chipmaker to manufacture its chips.\n\nPeople close to Bitmain said access to TSMC helped it become the world\u2019s dominant maker of Bitcoin mining rigs with an estimated 80 per cent of the market. For years Bitmain spent hundreds of millions of dollars pre-purchasing TSMC capacity, forcing rival miner makers to turn to other less capable chip foundries, the people said.\n\n\u201cThe energy-efficient chip is the heart of a mining machine,\u201d said Nishant Sharma, founder of crypto mining advisory BlocksBridge Consulting.\n\nZhan was designing chips for TV sets when Bitcoin started to gain traction. In 2013, he turned his technical prowess towards designing specialised processors known as ASICs to more efficiently execute the hashing algorithms that unlock new Bitcoins. By 2017, Bitmain\u2019s sales had jumped to $2.5bn, according to an IPO prospectus. Zhan\u2019s vision for the company expanded towards AI. In the US, Google had just unveiled ASICs for running deep-learning algorithms, which it called TPUs.\n\n\u201cWe are a company focused on high-performance processors,\u201d Zhan told a gathering in Beijing in 2017. \u201cWe started with cryptocurrency processors and now we\u2019re entering artificial intelligence, it\u2019s a new area of application but not a complete pivot.\u201d\n\nBitmain\u2019s first AI chip, the BM1680, was made by TSMC and shipped in 2017. But then the price of bitcoin started to fall, and along with it demand for crypto mining rigs. Hopes for a blockbuster Bitmain IPO in Hong Kong vanished.\n\nThe start-up laid off hundreds of employees and Zhan\u2019s co-founder Wu Jihan ousted him and reined in spending on AI. Zhan fought back by taking control of a Bitmain AI chip unit registered in his hometown of Fujian and sued Wu. The company, Fujian Sophon, told a court that Zhan\u2019s ousting had the potential to change the direction of \u201cour country\u2019s chip and blockchain development\u201d. Eventually Wu left.\n\nIn 2022, Zhan moved Bitmain\u2019s AI chip efforts to Sophgo, which he owned almost entirely when it was set up. The lines between the two companies remain blurry. Bitmain\u2019s and Sophgo\u2019s affiliated entities share some executives, addresses and phone numbers in official Chinese business records. Last year, they jointly sought to recruit new graduates at Harbin Institute of Technology, according to an advert.\n\nOne customer for their AI chips, Haitu Technology, described Sophgo as Bitmain\u2019s \u201crecommended distributor\u201d in a filing to Chinese securities regulators in late 2022. Bitmain itself does not sell its AI processors to small and medium-sized companies, Haitu said.\n\nSophgo has sent its AI processors to public security bureaus and smart city projects in Fujian, Anhui and Beijing, according to a company presentation seen by the Financial Times. Its AI accelerators have also been used to build an AI computing cluster in Shandong.\n\nNick Brown, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh, said the company\u2019s latest CPU, the SG2042, represented a leap forward for the open source RISC-V architecture it was built on, and was comparable with Intel and AMD processors for some supercomputing tasks.\n\n\u201cFor workloads that need lots of computation, lots of processing, lots of calculations, it performs really well,\u201d Brown said, after testing the chips on the university\u2019s supercomputing hardware.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first RISC-V CPU that you could say is a serious proposition for high performance workloads,\u201d said Brown.\n\nPublic records show some Chinese supercomputing centres, which are cut off from American chips, have begun to use Sophgo\u2019s processors.\n\n\u201cOnce Chinese companies gain a foothold, western companies basically stand no chance,\u201d Zhan told a conference in 2019. Now Sophgo will have to figure out how to get its processors made in China.\n\nAdditional reporting by Eleanor Olcott and Nian Liu in Beijing", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/46c48898-c468-45e8-bbaf-b655939c941a"}, {"uuid4": "a3364683-fbec-49ae-a632-2cd2237daf95", "title": "China\u2019s onetime \u2018solar king\u2019 struggles in US electric bus market", "description": "Denton Peng had hoped to replicate his past successes, but roadblocks emerged in his adopted country", "author": "Sun Yu", "published_date": "2025-01-27T05:01:00.792Z", "content": "Denton Peng, the onetime \u201csolar king\u201d of China who was briefly the country\u2019s youngest billionaire, emigrated to California in 2018 with plans to defibrillate a moribund industry: electric buses. Now several years into the effort, shares of his company Phoenix Motor trade for mere pennies and it has received two delisting warnings from Nasdaq. Despite generous US subsidies to help cities adopt zero-emission mass transit, Phoenix was able to deliver only about 40 buses in 2024, and it has lost money in every year of operation under Peng\u2019s leadership. The story of Phoenix illustrates the inherent challenge of manufacturing electric vehicles in the US and the seemingly quixotic goal of government-backed incentives to get the industry off the ground, much less become competitive with its Chinese counterparts. Though both China and the US have provided seed funding to the fledgling industry, inefficiency and cost structures \u2014 especially for labour \u2014 make western production a long-shot challenge.\n\nOut of the top 10 electric-bus makers in the world, only two are based in the US \u2014 one of which was bought by Peng after it went bankrupt. \u201cPeng is just running into the same issues that many US electric-car makers are facing \u2014 that they can\u2019t build a profitable vehicle without a huge part of their supply chain being from China,\u201d said Tu Le, founder of Sino Auto Insights, a Detroit-based consultancy. \u201cRegardless of how much is reshored, the United States will have a hard time getting to the cost level with China.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s EV industry features a large pool of cheap and productive labour, as well as a highly efficient supply chain few countries can rival.\n\n\u201cIf it takes one month to complete a project in China,\u201d said Peng in an interview with the Financial Times, \u201cit takes four to five in the US.\u201d\n\nGovernment support played a crucial role in driving Peng\u2019s earlier success. When he faced a funding gap to make the profitable yet capital-intensive solar wafer, a key component of solar cells, in 2005, local authorities in China lent him Rmb200mn and encouraged banks to provide more than Rmb25bn lines of credit for his venture, called LDK.\u00a0Chinese press nicknamed him the \u201csolar king\u201d.\n\nBusiness prospered as the company profited from the solar power boom in European countries. The bonanza ended after western nations began imposing sanctions on Chinese solar products in 2012, a blow to LDK that relied on developed markets for growth.\n\nPeng lost control of LDK in 2012 after the local government took over the company. Chinese authorities accused him of fraud related to a subsequent group he launched. Peng denied wrongdoing.\n\nPeng bought Phoenix Motorcars, a California-based electric-bus maker, for $12.5mn as he sought to return to manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThere is a chance I can succeed in making EVs in the US,\u201d he said.\n\nThree years later, Peng paid $10mn to acquire the transit bus operation of Proterra, a leading electric-bus maker that filed for bankruptcy a few months earlier, as he looked to increase capacity to meet orders.\n\nPhoenix merged with Proterra, creating one of the biggest electric-bus makers in the country. There was no shortage of demand for the vehicles as both the federal and state governments made a push to build more environmentally friendly public transit systems.\n\nThe Federal Transit Administration has over the past three years provided $4.9bn in subsidies for local authorities to purchase more than 4,600 zero or low emission buses, mostly electric ones.\n\nWhile the programme is a boon for Phoenix, it comes with a caveat \u2014 the company must locally source more than 70 per cent of its parts, measured by value, to qualify for the subsidy.\n\nThat has slowed down production and created a backlog of orders as the EV supply chains in the US remain under-developed.\n\n\u201cThe US EV industry is facing challenges in building a more efficient and affordable supply chain,\u201d said Peng. \u201cWe have trouble meeting orders partly because our suppliers are slow in making deliveries.\u201d\n\nPavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates, said the US electric bus industry, while growing fast, was \u201ctoo small to produce on a scale\u201d that allows a well-established supply chain to emerge.\n\nMolchanov added that it would take at least five years for the US electric bus market to become \u201cmeaningful\u201d.\n\nYet Peng could barely afford to wait for that long. Shares of Phoenix have traded at less than $1 \u2014 a threshold that could trigger delisting by Nasdaq \u2014 most of the time since he bought Proterra in 2023.\n\nThe best solution is to work with Chinese suppliers that enjoy cost and quality advantages over their US counterparts.\n\nPeng said Phoenix two years ago launched, without government subsidy, an electric shuttle bus aimed at commercial clients that cost 65 per cent less than its previous model by outsourcing parts to China.\n\nYet the Buy America requirement for government-subsidised electric transit buses, a major source of revenue for Phoenix, has made it difficult for Peng to replicate his cost-cutting magic.\n\nHe said he did not use Chinese-made batteries, known for their low price and high efficiency, for products with federal subsidy as they accounted for at least 30 per cent of the costs of components needed to make a bus.\n\nDespite the challenge, Peng is still keen to tap Chinese suppliers when possible. He said he was considering building electric bus or parts factories in China where production costs were less than half of the level in the US.\n\nThe new factories, according to Peng, would serve markets outside the US under an American brand and technology, which customers were willing to pay a premium for.\n\nPeng added that his future car parts factories in China would \u201ccertainly consider\u201d serving the US market if policy allowed.\n\nMolchanov of Raymond James said outsourcing to China \u201cmakes a lot of sense from an economic perspective\u201d, but could be \u201cpolitically controversial\u201d.\n\nHe went on to warn that Trump\u2019s pledge to revoke electric vehicle support might create \u201cadditional headwind\u201d for electric buses that could become out of reach for buyers without government subsidy.\n\nPeng has pinned his hopes on environmentally conscious states such as California that will ban sales of gas-powered cars by 2035.\n\n\u201cAs long as we can survive until then,\u201d he said, \u201cour company will definitely grow into a big one.\u201d", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/775744e5-5fc9-4d7e-a117-ff37de65ff65"}, {"uuid4": "ca5fea97-50da-49ff-8f74-1a5522ca0a65", "title": "Fuchsia Dunlop\u2019s culinary guide to Lunar New Year", "description": "The writer, cook and Chinese-food champion gets ready to greet the Year of the Snake. Plus, FT correspondents reveal how their cities will mark the occasion", "author": "Fuchsia Dunlop", "published_date": "2025-01-24T00:00:56.080Z", "content": "A couple of days before the Chinese New Year of 2004, my friend Fan Qun, her husband and I travelled by bus, minibus, boat and, finally, foot, to her family\u2019s remote village in the hills of Hunan province; her two brothers, migrant workers in Guangzhou, had also returned for the festival. On New Year\u2019s Eve, we rounded up a rooster from the paddy fields outside and her father dispatched it quickly with a cleaver, while the meat of a fattened pig that had already been slaughtered was smoked above the kitchen fire. Fan Qun\u2019s father made offerings to his ancestors at a domestic altar laid with the pig\u2019s head, a whole smoked fish and a block of tofu, as well as enamelled mugs of rice wine and homegrown tea.\n\nAll day, Fan Qun\u2019s mother and sister-in-law laboured in the kitchen. A chicken stew hung in a blackened cauldron over the fire; another pot filled with dried radishes sat in the embers. Steam billowed from the woks as the two women sizzled meats and vegetables on an old-fashioned, wood-fired range. Mid-afternoon, they brought out the feast: sweet, golden fritters of glutinous rice, home-cured bacon and carp, Cantonese roast duck brought home by the brothers, a magnificent rooster soup with medicinal herbs, dried squid with jujubes, smoked pork intestines, dishes of tofu and homegrown vegetables and a potful of rice with sweet potatoes. The young nieces, dressed in festive scarlet and pink, sang a song. Then we drank toasts of grain liquor and Coca-Cola and ate. At midnight, we all went outside to light firecrackers that snapped, sputtered and echoed up and down the valley.\n\nThe New Year\u2019s Eve reunion dinner (tuan nian fan) is at the heart of Lunar New Year celebrations all over the world. Traditionally, family members return to their ancestral homes for a sumptuous banquet of home-cooked dishes, followed by a week or two of idling and visiting relatives and friends. In rural areas of China, home-reared pork is often served, along with chicken and a whole fish, the latter because the phrase \u201ca fish every year\u201d (nian nian you yu) sounds the same as \u201ca surplus every year\u201d. But as the Chinese world is on a scale to rival Christendom, local festive food customs vary as much as global Christmas dinners. In the wheat-eating north of China, people traditionally prepare jiaozi dumplings, while the Sichuanese steam fat slices of pork belly in clay bowls packed with salted vegetables. In many parts of the country, families gather around bubbling hotpots packed with meatballs, quail eggs, chunks of pork belly and other delicacies.\n\nWhile the symbolic whole fish is almost ubiquitous on the Chinese festive table, the Cantonese are particularly playful with the auspicious meanings of their New Year dishes (the Chinese language is replete with homonyms and therefore ripe for punning). Slabs of New Year Cake, a sweet pudding made from glutinous rice, are eaten over the holidays because their name, nian gao, plays on another word with the same sound (gao): \u201chigher\u201d \u2014 in wealth, school grades, status or stature. In advance of the festivities, people gift each other coupons that can be redeemed at specific restaurants or shops for this and other seasonal cakes, also known as gao, made from radish and taro (\u201cradish cake futures,\u201d my Cantonese friend Roberta quips). Kumquats and mandarins are served because their golden colour invites prosperity, along with ruddy deep-fried chickens \u2014 red being the traditional colour of Chinese celebrations.\n\nIn Hong Kong and other centres of Cantonese society, restaurants create menus of lucky-number eight dishes, each one with a name that signifies luck, wealth or one of the other bonuses of life. \u201cSo many people dine out around the New Year that we have to offer set menus because the kitchen cannot cope with \u00e0 la carte,\u201d says Lau Kin-wai, veteran food columnist and proprietor of Kin\u2019s Kitchen in the Wanchai district. His restaurant is offering two set menus this year, priced per table at figures in Hong Kong dollars involving lots of auspicious \u201c8\u201ds: the pricier \u201cFour Seasons of Prosperity\u201d menu, for example, costs HK$9,888 ($1,270/\u00a31,030) for a table of 12. Every dish has a poetic name imbued with optimistic meanings, seasonal symbolism or punning words, from \u201cMake a Fortune, Increase Wealth and Honour\u201d (a dish made with hair moss \u2014 facai, which sounds the same as \u201cmake a fortune\u201d \u2014 and \u201cgolden coin\u201d dried scallops) to \u201cGolden Dragon Welcomes the New Year\u201d (tiger shrimps in cheese sauce with egg noodles) and \u201cDancing Phoenix Augments the Joyful Occasion\u201d (deep-fried chicken).\n\n\u201cWhen I was small,\u201d says Lau, \u201cpeople didn\u2019t have much money and cooked more themselves, so the New Year\u2019s Eve dinner normally took place at home. We would stock up on seasonal foods like cured pork and dried oysters [their name a pun on \u2018good business\u2019], as well as lucky sweets and seeds to offer visitors. On the first day of the New Year, we would eat a vegetarian meal because the markets were closed.\n\n\u201cThese days,\u201d he adds, \u201cmore and more Hongkongers have their celebratory meal in restaurants. And in the past few years, they\u2019ve been increasingly popping over to Shenzhen on the mainland, where they can eat lavishly for half the price, or seizing the chance to fly off on a foreign holiday.\u201d\n\nCantonese food customs have spilled over into diaspora communities. Chinese restaurants all over the world offer New Year cakes and symbolic menus. In recent years, an auspicious Malaysian and Singaporean dish has become wildly popular in Chinese circles all over the world: yu sheng, or \u201cprosperity toss\u201d. A colourful assembly of shredded ingredients, including raw fish, are bathed in a sweet dressing, then everyone around the table tosses the food together with their chopsticks while voicing good wishes for the year ahead \u2014 and the higher the ingredients fly above the table, the \u201chigher\u201d the luck. This year, far from China, that New Year with Fan Qun\u2019s family a distant memory, I\u2019ll be celebrating over a home-cooked Shanghainese feast in London \u2014 and I\u2019m looking forward to tossing the prosperity salad while welcoming the Year of the Snake.\n\nFuchsia Dunlop is the author of \u201cInvitation to a Banquet: The Story of Chinese Food\u201d, Fortnum & Mason Food Book of 2024\n\nWherever you are in the world, how do you celebrate the Lunar New Year?

In the event, his first target was Colombia, a South American oil and coffee exporter. Its harsh treatment last Sunday holds lessons for other nations weighing the consequences of the president\u2019s America First policies.\n\nAs a leftwing former guerrilla, Colombia\u2019s President Gustavo Petro was never going to be a Trump fan. But he incurred the US president\u2019s particular wrath after publicly vowing to turn back American military flights deporting migrants, complaining that his compatriots were being treated like criminals.\n\nFor a few hours, Bogot\u00e1\u2019s status flipped from traditional Washington ally to rogue state. Trump announced immediate 25 per cent tariffs on Colombian imports, rising to 50 per cent in a week, banking sanctions and a US travel ban for Colombian government officials and their allies.\u00a0Petro initially vowed retaliatory tariffs but quickly folded. He had little choice. For Colombia, a trade war with its biggest trading partner would have been devastating.\n\nDenmark and Panama will have been watching closely. Both are small nations in Trump\u2019s sights because they possess valuable territorial assets he covets. In Denmark\u2019s case, it is the strategic Arctic territory of Greenland and in Panama\u2019s, the shipping canal built by America over a century ago.\n\nMexico and Canada, US neighbours and big trading partners, are waiting to discover whether Trump will fulfil a threat to impose 25 per cent tariffs as soon as Saturday, tearing up three decades of North American free trade.\n\nRepublicans may be celebrating Trump\u2019s quick win over a comparatively weak South American president, who had apparently not thought through his impulsive decision. (Colombia had been accepting US military flights deporting its nationals since well before Trump\u2019s inauguration). But the long-term consequences of punishing and publicly humiliating an erstwhile ally are unlikely to favour the US.\n\nWashington has long portrayed itself as a reliable trade and security partner because it can be trusted to stick to international agreements and follow rules. In the Trump era, this no longer appears to be a given. While America has a right to detain and deport migrants who enter illegally \u2014 and Trump has an electoral mandate for that \u2014 anti-US sentiment around the world is likely to be stoked by a return to the bullying tactics of a bygone era.\n\nThere is a potential opening here for the EU to provide an alternative to America First, by stepping up its own investment in the region and ratifying a long-stalled trade pact with South American nations. But China and Russia will be looking for opportunities.\n\nBeijing has touted itself to developing nations as a trusted long-term partner interested in trade and investment rather than playing politics. The experience of some African and Latin American nations has sometimes shown otherwise, but compared with Trump\u2019s unpredictable tactics, Beijing may start to look more attractive.\n\nBy choosing in his first week to make threats against Colombia, Panama and Mexico, some of the closest US allies in the Americas, Trump has signalled a shift away from the soft power approach the US has favoured in recent decades to a harder form of power. While that may \u2014 as it did with Colombia \u2014 deliver short-term results, in the longer term it is just as likely to drive countries away from America. Since Beijing has already demonstrated its willingness to invest heavily in the region, the big winner from Trump\u2019s policies may ultimately not be the US, but China.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d771ef44-a167-40f7-b301-dfbdcf968401"}, {"uuid4": "06d8bd07-fca2-46cc-b517-55c56125a9bf", "title": "DeepSeek defies America\u2019s AI supremacy", "description": "A Chinese advance tests the assumptions behind lofty US tech valuations", "author": "The editorial board", "published_date": "2025-01-27T18:20:36.340Z", "content": "America\u2019s superinflated tech stocks had seemed due for a correction for months, but the trigger has come from an unexpected source. The latest large language model from China\u2019s artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek may not be quite a \u201cSputnik moment\u201d. There are parallels, even so, with the early space race, when ingenuity helped Soviet engineers keep pace with and sometimes surpass US rivals, despite their relative lack of computing power and cutting-edge technologies. The US went on to win the Moon race, and establish a sustainable edge in space. But DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough upturns the assumptions that have underpinned US tech valuations, of an unassailable supremacy in AI that would be extended by spending billions of dollars on chips and infrastructure.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s achievement is to have developed an LLM that AI experts say achieves a performance similar to US rivals OpenAI and Meta but claims to use far fewer \u2014 and less advanced \u2014 Nvidia chips, and to have been trained for a fraction of the cost. Some of its assertions remain to be verified. If they are true, however, it represents a potentially formidable competitor.\n\nFirst, like Meta of the US but unlike OpenAI or Google\u2019s Gemini, it is open source \u2014 ready to share the recipe for its secret sauce rather than keep it locked away in hope of extracting maximum financial gain. That makes it appealing for developers to use and build on. Second, it can be put together on much more of a shoestring budget and with much less computing power. This explains Monday\u2019s plunging stock prices not just of front-line tech companies but of those that make chip equipment and supply electrical hardware for data centres.\n\nThe big US companies are focused on a particular model of scaling AI by throwing vast amounts of capital, data and computing power at the problem. First Mistral, a French AI start-up, and now DeepSeek have demonstrated that companies with fewer resources may end up with smarter and more efficient models. The increasing efficiency of these models is also likely to spur increased demand for their use.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s advance highlights, too, that China is managing to make technological leaps in AI despite export controls introduced by the Biden administration intended to deprive it of both the most powerful chips and the advanced tools needed to make them. Chinese AI start-ups have been compelled to find inventive ways of extracting the most juice from the chips they do have. Far from stifling Chinese innovation, Washington may have stimulated it. And the success of often domestically trained Chinese engineers in increasing efficiency and finding workarounds raises questions over whether the technological \u201cmoat\u201d established by high-spending US groups such as Meta, Google, OpenAI and Anthropic is as wide and impregnable as they had thought.\n\nMany advanced democracies will be wary of a Chinese government seen in many ways as inimical to western interests potentially acquiring leadership in the most transformative technology of our era. Yet some political leaders elsewhere, along with many consumers and developers, may welcome a market that is less dominated by a handful of American companies.\n\nThe open question now is not necessarily who will develop the best AI models but who can apply them best to real-world tasks. Kai-Fu Lee, a Chinese AI pioneer, has long argued that China excels on the application front even if it may lag behind in infrastructure. That was before the Chinese start-up world was squeezed by the political clampdown on tech entrepreneurs and the surge of investment in US AI start-ups. But after DeepSeek\u2019s achievement, it looks a much more even game.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/cd1a6482-37e4-475b-8ef6-59d0340fcc41"}, {"uuid4": "d4087b5b-54ed-4061-bc26-2962df88422f", "title": "Trump gives Chinese equities a breather", "description": "If the US president takes a more flexible approach, tariffs may end up being used as a bargaining tool rather than end goal", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-01-24T11:55:47.851Z", "content": "When US presidents opine on China, it is rarely good news for investors in Chinese equities. At least in recent years, announcements have tended to mark punitive measures such as blacklists, export restrictions and tariffs.\n\nThat trend was bucked on Friday. Chinese stocks rose after Donald Trump remarked on a \u201cfriendly\u201d conversation with Xi Jinping and hinted at a potentially softer approach toward tariffs. The diplomatic cordiality between geopolitical rivals may not guarantee lasting progress on trade talks. Yet for local stocks, it arrives at a perfect time.\n\nBlue-chips such as Tencent, Alibaba and JD.com gained 3 per cent on Friday, as did Hong Kong\u2019s benchmark index which is particularly sensitive to geopolitical tensions. The Hang Seng rose about 2 per cent, bringing gains to 6 per cent since last week. That suggests relief that Trump says he would rather not have to use tariffs against on Chinese goods \u2014 a big question hanging over valuations for the past year.\n\nChina\u2019s exports to the US account for about 4 per cent of its GDP. In the short term, tariffs drive up costs for Chinese exporters and squeeze margins. Their long-term effects, such as weakening the renminbi and inflating risk premium for Chinese stocks, raise concerns about capital flight. If Trump is taking a more flexible approach, these measures may end up being used as a bargaining tool with China rather than an end goal.\n\nThat in turn allows investors to consider other factors that could support Chinese stocks in future. Beijing is trying to improve shareholder returns. Large-scale stimulus measures and plans to inject around Rmb1tn ($138bn) in long-term capital into the financial system ought to improve sentiment.\n\nChinese companies paid out a record Rmb2.4tn in dividends last year while share buybacks also hit an all-time high, according to official data. This push has particularly benefited high-dividend stocks, such as banks, insurers and utilities. Meanwhile, regulators have been directing insurers and mutual funds to increase local stock holdings \u2014 which could draw more capital into the country\u2019s markets.\n\nValuations remain relatively low, with China\u2019s blue-chip CSI 300 Index trading at around 1.3 times book value. By contrast, the S&P 500 stands at around four times that level.\n\nThe reliance of local exporters\u2019 earnings on geopolitical dynamics means their share prices will remain highly sensitive to unfolding developments in the coming months. But for now, there is enough good news \u2014 both real and rhetorical \u2014 to support short-term gains.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/152b9d13-69cc-47e7-af09-354da951e16d"}, {"uuid4": "9aa8d7ad-a332-41bc-b43f-5bdb21407897", "title": "When peak Chinese oil demand meets \u2018drill, baby, drill\u2019", "description": "Trump\u2019s slogan is a bet on the energy status quo, not on the future", "author": "The editorial board", "published_date": "2025-01-23T18:54:28.492Z", "content": "What happens when the world\u2019s largest oil producer goes all-out to boost production just as the appetite of the world\u2019s largest oil importer may be peaking? Demand from China \u2014 which has accounted for half of all world oil demand growth over three decades \u2014 shows signs of levelling off thanks to slowing economic expansion and an epochal shift to green power and electric vehicles. Returning US President Donald Trump has, meanwhile, declared a national energy emergency intended to boost fossil fuel output, and begun to reverse the Biden administration\u2019s green agenda. In theory, these dynamics might lead to an oil glut and falling prices. The reality is more complex.\n\nThe US-China divergence is at root about competing visions of energy security. Beijing\u2019s embrace of renewable energy reflects less a noble conversion to saving the planet, and more a strategic determination to reduce dependence on imported oil. Conversely, alongside the popularity of his \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d mantra among consumers balking at the costs of the green transition, Trump does not want the US to rely on a green energy supply chain dominated by China.\n\nTrump\u2019s Treasury secretary pick, Scott Bessent, suggests America can produce an additional 3mn barrels of oil-equivalent a day by 2028. There may be scope, in time, to lift output of natural gas, which the president is eager to export to Europe. For all the rhetoric and deregulation, however, US oil production \u2014 which at 13mn b/d is already a record for any country \u2014 will be much harder to raise. Producers are unlikely to boost drilling a lot at current US benchmark prices of about $75 a barrel; a recent survey found oil groups needed a $65 price for drilling to be profitable, and $89 to justify a substantial increase.\n\nAt the same time, exports from some other suppliers may fall \u2014 thanks to US actions. The departing Biden administration this month imposed stiff new sanctions on Russian oil, which by some estimates could remove up to 2mn b/d from the market. The new US president threatened this week to go further unless Vladimir Putin strikes a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Tougher US moves to restrict Iranian exports, in line with Trump\u2019s first-term approach, could take hundreds of thousands of barrels a day more off the market.\n\nThis would open a potential opportunity for the world\u2019s swing producer \u2014 Saudi Arabia; the Opec consortium has for months been holding back planned production increases, to balance the market with Chinese demand drooping. Trump\u2019s programme could then lead ironically to Saudi Aramco, more than US oil companies, opening the spigots. (Addressing the World Economic Forum on Thursday, the US president explicitly called on Opec to push down global oil prices.) For Trump, this could create leeway to pursue his geopolitical goals without pushing up prices at the pump. Even if US oil producers do not end up raising their own output by much, they will be happy to see Trump acting to stimulate demand, for example by cutting incentives to switch to EVs.\n\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d slogan seems aimed at giving confidence to oil and gas producers, not just in America but in much of the world. It symbolises his intention to remove the regulatory controls and environmental, social and governance investment principles that have constrained the industry in recent years, and his repudiation of efforts to curb climate change.\n\nIt is hard to see how those efforts can succeed without a vast global shift to electric power from green sources. Though it is still burning a lot of coal, China\u2019s green energy shift looks, then, like a bet on the future, while the US is betting on the status quo. There may be hard-nosed reasons for Trump\u2019s America to make that choice. But the consequences may be that the US is left on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of history \u2014 and the existential battle to contain global warming is dealt a severe blow.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4581f40a-aeb5-4be0-a218-b853082fbbff"}, {"uuid4": "ee423a9d-99de-459d-9187-165cbcedafd5", "title": "China is stealing the scene in Japan\u2019s TV market ", "description": "Underestimating the ingenuity of Chinese competitors has proven unwise", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.603Z", "content": "There was a time when nearly every hotel room seemed to have a TV with a Sony, Panasonic, Samsung or LG logo on the bottom of the screen. Affordable Chinese models have long been chipping away at the dominance of such Japanese and South Korean brands. Now, however, China\u2019s ascent is about more than just price.\n\nTake what\u2019s happening in Japan. Local brands are increasingly being displaced by Chinese manufacturers on their home turf. Chinese makers accounted for more than half of all flat-screen TVs sold in Japan last year for the first time on record, according to research firm BCN.\n\nIn the past, Chinese companies have disrupted industries primarily through cheapness. That meant even as they gained market share, a clear distinction remained between premium and budget segments. The high-end market, which typically has fatter margins, still provided a lucrative buffer for incumbent players to sustain their business as Chinese makers focused on affordability. That may now be changing.\n\nTV makers aiming to capture the premium segment typically differentiate themselves in two ways: advancements in display technology and the integration of artificial intelligence features. Chinese electronics groups including Hisense, TCL and Xiaomi have been quick to integrate the latest AI features into their TVs to enhance picture clarity, contrast and colour based on real-time scene detection, as well as suggest content based on user preferences. They also offer seamless integration with global smart TV platforms and streaming services.\n\nPremium TVs using Oled technology, which enables ultra-slim display panels and vivid colours, were once the exclusive domain of Japanese and South Korean makers. These TVs offered higher profit margins compared with traditional LCD TVs, offsetting weakness in the lower-end market. Yet over the past five years, Chinese makers led by Xiaomi, TCL and Hisense have been aggressively expanding their offerings here, as their investments in display innovation begin to pay off.\n\nShares of Xiaomi have more than doubled in the past six months, while TCL Electronics stock has nearly tripled in the past year. Even after those gains, TCL trades at just below 12 times forward earnings \u2014 a steep discount to Japanese peers. That would be justifiable if Chinese TV makers weren\u2019t moving upmarket.\n\nUnderestimating the ingenuity of Chinese competitors has proven unwise: look no further than DeepSeek\u2019s dramatic arrival in the AI arms race.

Global investors wiped\u2009almost $600bn off Nvidia\u2019s market capitalisation as a result, questioning whether pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into gargantuan AI computing clusters was necessary.\n\nThese concerns were all far from the minds of Mililing villagers, a small community in the southern province of Guangdong where Liang grew up and where the 40-year-old billionaire returned home for the Lunar New Year holiday, flanked by security guards.\u00a0Mililing is so small that there appears to have hitherto been nothing written about it online in English.\n\nThe reception was jubilant. \u201cLiang Wenfeng returns to his hometown to spread good results and add energy to rural revitalisation,\u201d wrote one banner adorning an inflatable red arch.\n\nLiang\u2019s family home has become an unlikely pilgrimage site for those interested in seeing where this reluctant celebrity was raised. But while his neighbours praised his achievements, none could say much about the current life of the mysterious man who has sparked an existential panic in Silicon Valley.\u00a0DeepSeek and Liang did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLocals say Liang comes from a family of educators. His parents and grandfather were all teachers.\n\n\u201cHis parents are good people. He left the village for school at a young age,\u201d says one neighbour also surnamed Liang but not related. Mililing, he says, is a village \u201cof a thousand Liangs\u201d.\n\nAt the middle school in the nearby town, one of his teachers says Liang stood out in the 50-student class as \u201cwell behaved and mild mannered\u201d. \u201cHe was a top student, especially in maths. He liked reading comic books,\u201d he adds.\n\nLiang left high school in 2002 and went to Zhejiang University to complete an undergraduate degree and a masters in computer science, where he penned a thesis about motion detection algorithms. After graduating in 2010, he parlayed his computing skills into automated stock trading, first as a freelancer then at his own hedge fund High-Flyer in 2015.\n\nHigh-Flyer has grown to become one of China\u2019s top four quant funds, using algorithms to execute trades. After building a fortune in trading, Liang pivoted into generative AI, utilising both talent and computing resources from High-Flyer to launch DeepSeek in 2023.\n\nOne manager at a rival fund who has known Liang for years says: \u201cHe stands out from our crowd because he\u2019s a true engineer. He thinks and acts like one. While we\u2019re managing people and funds, he is coding every day.\u201d\n\nLiang\u2019s stated goal with DeepSeek is to pursue artificial general intelligence, a holy grail that OpenAI is also working towards, which will herald a time when computers are capable of humanlike critical thinking. The fund manager says Liang will finally \u201cbe able to entirely remove the human factor\u201d by achieving AGI.\n\nLiang\u2019s fellow quants are happy to see him find success with DeepSeek. \u201cI hope this will mean Beijing will be more friendly to us,\u201d says another trader.\n\nWhile quants are revered in the west as financial geniuses of the digital age, they have been vilified in China. During stock market routs, regulators have limited their activity, accusing quants of profiting at the expense of the country\u2019s roughly 200mn retail investors. The wider finance industry has also experienced a number of rocky years, with officials capping pay at state-owned funds and criticising the sector for not contributing to societal development.\n\nBeijing has a more positive attitude towards AI companies and has recognised Liang\u2019s contributions at DeepSeek. Before the holiday, he was selected as the only AI leader to join a publicised meeting with China\u2019s second-in-command, Li Qiang. Along with a small group of entrepreneurs, he was exhorted to make technological breakthroughs for the country.\n\nIn public, Liang has remained silent, even as he has become a focal point in US-China tensions, with some US lawmakers reacting to DeepSeek\u2019s progress by suggesting further limits on China\u2019s access to Nvidia chips.\n\nLiang\u2019s silence is true to his character. \u201cFor those who know him well, he can talk a lot when it\u2019s a topic of interest. You need to get used to his communication style. He\u2019s not being rude when he\u2019s suddenly quiet, which often happens. He\u2019s thinking,\u201d says another fund manager.\u00a0\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want to talk to you, he\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek has not responded to attacks from US rivals, which range from accusations of technology theft to claims that the company is being used as an asset of the Chinese state.\n\nThe internet has also been left to hunt for clues about Liang, dissecting the sparse public information available.\n\nBut for residents of Mililing, he represents something more innocent: a hard-working student from a small farming community that made it big. \u201cWe all grew up in this village,\u201d says Leon Liang, who used to play football with the younger Liang. \u201cWe\u2019re very proud of him.\u201d\n\neleanor.olcott@ft.com, zijing.wu@ft.com\n\nAdditional

leverage of these products will be capped at a factor of 2x, or -2x.\n\nJean-Francois Mesnard-Sense, head of exchange traded products at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said Hong Kong had become the first market in Asia to offer single stock leveraged and inverse products.\n\n\u201cThis will further enhance our product ecosystem, reinforcing Hong Kong\u2019s role as a leading ETP marketplace in Asia,\u201d said Mesnard-Sense, adding that HKEX would work with issuers and stakeholders towards introducing the new products.\n\nSally Wong, chief executive of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association, said she welcomed greater flexibility to allow more innovation in product offering as a general principle.\n\nBut she also noted that the complexity and risk profile of these types of products would mean they would only be catering to a \u201cvery niche market segment\u201d.\n\nHong Kong allowed the first leveraged and inverse products in 2016, initially limited to products tracking liquid and broadly based \u201cnon-Hong Kong, non-mainland foreign equity indexes\u201d.\n\nProducts tracking Hong Kong\u2019s stock market were added in 2017 and the product universe was extended to China\u2019s onshore stock markets in 2020.\n\nBosera Asset Management, China Asset Management (HK), CSOP Asset Management and Fubon Fund Management have launched a total of 19 leveraged and inverse products in Hong Kong so far, tracking equities indexes and commodities including cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn the circular, the SFC said the new product types would have to meet existing rules for listed structured funds and ETFs, in addition to some other requirements for leveraged and inverse products around their naming and other aspects.\n\nThe SFC does not allow leveraged and inverse products to be named \u201cETFs\u201d in order to differentiate them from conventional ETFs. The products are also required to include the leverage or inverse factor and the word \u201cdaily\u201d in the name, to emphasise their daily rebalancing feature.\n\nIssuers were also expected to conduct \u201cextensive investor education before launching the funds in Hong Kong\u201d, said the regulator.\n\nThe SFC might consider introducing further requirements applicable to specific types of listed structured funds as necessary, according to the circular.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

Confronted with the same problem the Russians used . . . a pencil.\n\nThis is, inconveniently, a fairytale. Both sides tried pencils and both sides ended up using the Space Pen, a product developed entirely in the private sector.\u00a0But the myth often resurfaces as an industrial, geopolitical and ideological parable because it nicely captures the terror that infuses all those fields: that the other company/side/economic model can, and may, be structurally better placed to work smarter and cheaper.\n\nDid the \u201cSpace Pen\u201d meme return this week as investors and governments gawped at China\u2019s supposedly low-cost DeepSeek AI model, wondered whether US export controls had backfired, then lost their nerve around the billions invested in the more costly American approach to the same problem? Of course it did.\n\nThe more unsettling phrase of the moment, though, should be kaizen \u2014 the Japanese concept of \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d which once struck nervous awe into US corporate hearts and which China, one way or another, now looks to have quietly mastered. Partly by hiring Japanese kaizen masters undervalued in their own economy.\n\nKaizen first properly entered the international business lexicon in the 1980s, when American and European companies needed to understand why Japanese companies were beating them \u2014 in terms of both price and quality \u2014 on cars, consumer electronics and semiconductors. It suited both sides to identify the differentiator as a patient, distinctly Japanese, betterment of product and process.\n\nThe practical effects of kaizen were remarkable: they were among the prime reasons that Japan\u2019s economy became huge in the 1970s and 80s, and why so many of its companies retain global competitiveness in a formidable range of manufacturing fields.\n\nBut kaizen\u2019s evolution during Japan\u2019s long, stagnant post-bubble decades is perhaps more extraordinary. Once the era of financial excess evaporated, kaizen became a survival superpower: a simultaneous propellant of higher quality and leanness in corrosive times. Deflation, and the inability of Japanese manufacturers to secure pricing power in their domestic market, made cost-cutting a fine art.\n\nChinese manufacturers, with their attention long fixed on cost and technology, have been closely scrutinising all this, and have seen ways to make kaizen their own. DeepSeek may represent a software breakthrough, but it is one borne on the shoulders of a now relentlessly, incrementally advancing hardware sector.\n\nMany will argue that China\u2019s acquisition of technology has been opportunist at best and underhanded at worst. Where outright theft or coercion is not blamed (and it is, frequently), foreign companies have lost key technology to badly formulated transfer deals or excessive optimism over the ability to protect IP. But that has long ceased to explain everything.\n\nIn China\u2019s most recent and visible industrial achievements \u2014 the production of low-cost, competitive quality electric cars, consumer electronics, industrial machinery, high speed trains and robots \u2014 some version of kaizen is now at work. And there are reasons to suspect that the Chinese iteration may, for a stint, work faster, more disruptively and with more visible results, than the original.\n\nFirst, China has the numbers and talent to throw at kaizen on a much larger scale than Japan ever mustered. Increments work best when there are a lot of them.\n\nSecond, it is happening in an era where consumers are far quicker to identify and communicate when a product is not exactly as they would like it.\n\nBut a third is that they may be able to pay for speed. As well as directly observing kaizen in action at Japanese manufacturing operations, Chinese companies, according to recruitment agents in Tokyo, have found they can lure away Japanese semiconductor, railway and robotics engineers as consultants. This is not new, say the agents, but it is now sharply accelerating.\n\nJapanese companies tend to retire highly qualified people early, have not, for some years during the deflationary period, paid them especially handsomely and have instilled less parting loyalty than they might have hoped. They can be paid well by a Chinese company and, without explicitly imparting industrial secrets, their worth is immense: kaizen is fundamentally a process of trial and error, and an experienced engineer can impart the invaluable, cost-saving nod on what was tried but didn\u2019t work.\n\nAdvice such as: forget the pencil, it was useless.\n\nleo.lewis@ft.com", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f5bbb712-ac6d-4c0f-9136-e4304461d905"}, {"uuid4": "e71d86fc-9e98-4c88-97e5-c5b3f514faa1", "title": "German companies are risking a \u2018lose-lose\u2019 decoupling with China ", "description": "The corporate and political winds appear to be blowing increasingly in that direction", "author": "Richard Milne", "published_date": "2025-01-30T00:01:10.008Z", "content": "Decoupling can be painful. Germany found that out the hard way after weaning itself off its dependence on cheap Russian gas following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNow German companies from Volkswagen and BMW to BASF and Mercedes-Benz are facing what could be a stiffer challenge: a potential scaling back of ties with China, once one of the main sources of their profits. The corporate and political winds appear to be blowing increasingly in that direction.\n\nFriedrich Merz, the frontrunner to become German chancellor in elections next month, warned companies that China was part of an \u201caxis of autocracies\u201d and that investing there involved \u201cgreat risk\u201d. \u201cMy heartfelt request to all companies\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Limit the risk you take in order to avoid endangering your own company if it triggers an immediate write-off,\u201d he said last week.\n\nThat appears to mark a change from the rhetoric of current chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has vaguely talked of \u201cde-risking\u201d from China but also lobbied for better market access for German companies on a trip last year to Beijing together with business leaders. There is also pressure from the US, increasing with Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, for Germany to choose a side between Washington and Beijing.\n\nFor big German companies, this might all be beside the point. A decision on China ties may not be entirely in their hands to take.\n\nThe potential from China\u2019s huge population and its rising middle class enticed German carmakers and metal bashing industrial companies to expand in the country, overriding any worries about geopolitical tensions or human rights concerns.\n\nBut long-standing correlation between Chinese economic growth and German exports to China has broken down since the Covid-19 pandemic. German exports to China increased faster than to any other major trading partner from 2015-20 but have fallen back since.\n\nGerman companies, particularly the carmakers, face huge market pressure in China. For years derided as producing cheap, clunky cars, Chinese manufacturers \u2014 admittedly heavily supported by the state \u2014 have shot past their German counterparts in developing electric vehicles.\n\nGerman carmakers\u2019 EV market share in China was just 4 per cent in 2024, the lowest of any country, according to the German Association of the Automotive Industry. This matters as EV sales in China are more than double those in Europe, US, Canada, Japan and South Korea combined.\n\nOne non-German automotive boss thinks that German manufacturers need to give up on China, an especially difficult thing given how lucrative the market has been for them in the past. \u201cTheir share is pretty much going to zero. It will be painful,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe issue is how painful and fast the process will be. VW delivered 4.2mn cars in China in 2019, making \u20ac4.4bn in operating profit. By 2023, those figures were down to 3.2mn deliveries and \u20ac2.6bn in operating profit.\n\nOverall, sales of foreign brands in China have fallen to a record low of less than 40 per cent market share, down from more than 60 per cent in 2020, according to data from Shanghai consultancy Automobility. China still represents between a quarter and almost half of sales for VW, BMW and Mercedes suggesting more suffering could come.\n\nGerman carmakers are keen to protect what they have, however, leading to some strange developments. Analysts estimate German groups such as VW may have to fork out hundreds of millions of euros to Chinese rivals to buy carbon credits to meet new EU pollution rules for this year.\n\nThen there is the spectacle of BMW and Mercedes joining Chinese manufacturers in suing the EU over tariffs on EVs from China. Ola K\u00e4llenius, chief executive of Mercedes, also told the FT this month that the EU should instead try to encourage Chinese carmakers to open more plants in Europe.\n\nGerman carmakers are also pushing back against an EU ban on the sale of new fossil-fuel cars from 2035. All of which raises the question of whether German reluctance to decouple from an autocracy is driving EU policy in an unwanted direction.\n\n\u201cGerman dependency on Russian gas slowed the transition to renewable energy. I\u2019m worried now they are slowing our transition to EVs,\u201d says one European industrial boss.\n\nHow this German de-risking or decoupling plays out will be one of the main European corporate stories of the coming years. Can its companies avoid a lose-lose situation, where they find themselves squeezed out of the Chinese market and/or outcompeted by Chinese rivals at home?\n\nrichard.milne@ft.com", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f61d6b7b-0250-4edf-aac1-ba0ca18545cd"}, {"uuid4": "8f5048d6-0d6d-4255-9385-6a9888ee5664", "title": "The baby gap: why governments can\u2019t pay their way to higher birth rates", "description": "Governments offer a catalogue of creative incentives for childbearing \u2014 yet fertility rates just keep dropping", "author": "Janina Conboye", "published_date": "2025-01-29T05:00:47.734Z", "content": "Politicians in Lestij\u00e4rvi thought they had the answer to Finland\u2019s demographic woes: each mother of a newborn baby would receive \u20ac1,000 a year for 10 years if they stayed in the Nordic country\u2019s second-smallest municipality.\n\nBut more than a decade after they introduced the payments, and over \u20ac400,000 poorer, officials were forced to concede defeat: Lestij\u00e4rvi\u2019s population has shrunk by a fifth since the scheme started.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t worth doing at all,\u201d said Niko Aihio, the town\u2019s former head of education. \u201cThe baby boom only lasted one year.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers around the world are grappling with the same problems as those in Lestij\u00e4rvi: no matter what they seem to offer in the way of incentives, people are not having more babies. For the Finnish municipality it failed even to lure people from elsewhere: \u201cIt didn\u2019t stop people moving away, and it didn\u2019t attract new families,\u201d Aihio said.\n\nChina has offered free fertility treatments, Hungary big tax exemptions and cash, and Singapore grants for parents and grandparents. A Danish travel company even ran an ad campaign to \u201cDo it for Denmark\u201d. In Japan, the state funds AI-powered matchmaking, while Tokyo\u2019s metropolitan government is offering a four-day working week to staff in an attempt to encourage people to become parents.\n\nGovernments are still hunting for policy options to counter a looming economic crisis as older populations expand and the pool of workers shrinks. It is a shift that think-tank the Robert Schuman Foundation has called \u201cdemographic suicide\u201d.\n\nThe reasons for the trend have been fiercely debated, while some potential solutions, such as immigration and pushing people to retire later, have proved deeply politically unpalatable.\n\n\u201cThe issue of population ageing presents multiple challenges for Europe,\u201d said Olli Rehn, governor of the Finnish central bank. \u201cFirst, the worsening dependency ratio is putting significant pressure on public finances. Second, an ageing society tends to be less economically dynamic and less entrepreneurial.\u201d\n\nThe decline in birth rates is a peculiarly universal problem \u2014 no continent has been left unscathed by the trend. Two-thirds of the world\u2019s population now lives in countries where people are having babies at a rate too low to replace their population.\n\nMore and more countries are joining the list. By 2100, just 12 countries \u2014 11 in Africa and the tiny Pacific island state of Vanuatu \u2014 are expected to have fertility rates above the crucial level of 2.1 births per woman. Not a single country is expected to have a rate above 2.3 by the end of the century.\n\nPolicymakers may be tempted to focus on more immediate crises. But the decline in fertility rates threatens to lead to deep economic malaise. Fewer babies and more older residents lead to a lower proportion of people of working age, denting tax revenues at the same time as costs associated with ageing societies, such as state pensions and healthcare, increase.\n\nWithout sufficient policy action, analysts at rating agency S&P Global estimated in 2023 that fiscal deficits would balloon by 2060 from a global average now of 2.4 per cent of GDP to 9.1 per cent. The global net government debt-to-GDP level would very nearly triple.\n\nMeanwhile, a McKinsey report in January suggested many of the world\u2019s richest economies, such as the UK, US and Japan, would need to at least double productivity growth to maintain historical improvements in living standards amid sharp falls in their birth rates.\n\nParts of Asia, especially China, and Latin American countries are particularly exposed. In 1995, 10 workers in eastern Asia supported one old-age person; by 2085, it is projected to be one to one.\n\nPoliticians worry that they may be powerless to act, as social pressures on women undergo a profound change. Sarah Harper, professor of gerontology and director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, said surveys of young women across the world, from Europe to south-east Asia, suggested a once built-in social obligation for women to reproduce \u2014 and an assumption on their part that if they could, they probably would have children \u2014 no longer existed.\n\nCareers and increased gender equality are a part of that. \u201cWe have a whole cohort of women in high-income countries, but also in south-east Asia, and particularly east Asia\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009who have been educated in a very gender-neutral way,\u201d said Harper. \u201cThey enter the workplace in a gender-neutral way, and then they become parents and suddenly, no matter how hard one tries, it\u2019s not gender-neutral.\u201d\n\nPolicy is also likely to have little effect where norms around the number of children are ingrained. Harper noted that in China, despite the end of the one-child policy in 2016, women still generally had just one child.\n\n\u201cOnce you come to a one-child society, then why would you want to have two children? Because everyone has one child\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009everyone is geared up to having one child. Institutions are geared up to having one child,\u201d Harper said.\n\nHeidi Colleran, an academic at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, said that despite decades of research and thousands of people working on demographic trends, there was little to no consensus on why fertility rates kept declining.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of general threads to pull on: the rise of the nuclear family, changes in the age of marriage, the rate at which people live together, the age at which people start having their first child is getting older and older,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of these individual-level features\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and they\u2019re all correct\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. [But] the same constellation of predictors, they are going to be correlated with each other in a different way in different places.\u201d\n\nYet, while personal choice has played a part in the global decline in childbearing, studies indicate people are often having fewer children than they would like to \u2014 indicating there could still be a role for public policies in changing that.\n\nBarriers such as the cost of childcare and housing, financial instability, persistent gender inequality, inflexible working conditions, and a lack of job security are among the factors holding people back from having more children.\n\nBetter policies may not be able to close the gap completely, but they can help. \u201cSupportive family policies \u2014 such as accessible childcare, financial incentives, and cultural acceptance of working parents \u2014 can significantly impact demographic trends,\u201d Rehn said.\n\nExperts agree. \u201cConventional pro-natal policy that is chucking money at the problem works to an extent,\u201d said Lyman Stone, demographer at the Institute of Family Studies, who specialises in fertility.\n\nStone said studies showed South Korean fertility rates could be even lower than they are now without baby bonus programmes, the expansion of state-funded childcare, subsidised fertility treatments and housing assistance.\n\nAt the same time, Finland remains one of the world\u2019s most rapidly ageing societies thanks to a big baby boom after the second world war. Neither cheap childcare, nor \u201cbaby money\u201d paid out by dozens of municipalities, appear to have had much impact on the country\u2019s birth rate, which remains among Europe\u2019s lowest.\n\nAihio said that good local services \u2014 such as libraries, swimming pools and decent childcare \u2014 seemed more important than money in encouraging women to have babies. And Rehn acknowledged that policies could take a \u201clong time\u201d to show any pay-off.\n\nSome governments have also faced criticism for how they target measures to encourage people to become parents. In Italy, for example \u2014 where the fertility rate stands at a modest 1.2 \u2014 only heterosexual, married women are allowed to undergo in vitro fertilisation, even privately. Single women and those in same-sex partnerships are denied access.\n\nAnother \u201chuge headache for policymakers\u201d, said Paula Sheppard, evolutionary anthropologist at Oxford university, was that different parts of the population needed different policies.\n\nWomen with low levels of education delay having children because of concerns about the stability of their relationships and the need to live near their parents. By contrast, those with a university education worry about dropping down the career ladder and want a hands-on partner, her research has suggested.\n\nOthers studying the challenge of old-age dependency ratios argue there is no need to focus policy changes primarily on births.\n\nEdward Paice, a demographics expert focusing on Africa, said there was an obvious answer to the west\u2019s demographic problems: immigration. \u201cEurope can\u2019t hermetically seal itself anyway. There are tremendous opportunities for western countries to rethink how they engage with African countries,\u201d he said.\n\nAn influx of foreigners has slowly but steadily increased Finland\u2019s population in recent years. But while Rehn acknowledged that work- and education-related immigration was \u201can essential part of the solution\u201d, he added: \u201cOf course, in the age of populism this is a politically challenging message.\u201d\n\nGovernments also want people to work for longer. Harper, the professor of gerontology, said it was important for societies to acknowledge that retiring from the workforce and then expecting to live on social support for decades afterwards was\u2009\u201cjust not sustainable\u201d.\n\nLike immigration, raising the retirement age can come at a steep political cost.\n\nIn France in 2023, people took to the streets in protest as President Emmanuel Macron rammed through legislation to raise the retirement age from 62 to just 64. Many Chinese have reacted angrily to legislation to raise statutory retirement ages, which are some of the world\u2019s lowest.\n\n\u201cYou can either increase migration rates or retirement age, or encourage people to have more children,\u201d said Edward Davies, policy director at the Centre for Social Justice in the UK. \u201cI suspect of the three, people naturally would like to have families, whereas actually telling them they have to retire later or you have to have mass migration \u2014 it\u2019s probably just less popular.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by David Pilling in London\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nHow global demography resembles a Ponzi scheme / From Eric Filseth, Palo Alto, CA, US", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2f4e8e43-ab36-4703-b168-0ab56a0a32bc"}, {"uuid4": "92ef02e1-ca28-4544-97f0-6773f8275e95", "title": "Tech in 2025: China\u2019s AI \u2018Sputnik moment\u2019", "description": "Is China about to catch up with the US in the artificial intelligence race?", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-01-28T17:36:48.395Z", "content": "The Chinese company DeepSeek has shocked the world with an AI model that could rival those built by the biggest artificial intelligence companies in Silicon Valley.

Or at least something interesting about how investors see the global economy today.\n\nLo, the spread between India and China\u2019s 10 year sovereign bond yields hit an 11-year high of 5.2 percentage points earlier this month, and remains near its highest ever levels.\n\nThe recent ballooning is mostly due to Chinese yields grinding lower and lower. Indian yields have actually fallen as well lately, due to expectations for rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of India, the surging US dollar, and last year\u2019s inclusion into JPMorgan\u2019s influential emerging market bond indices.\n\nHowever, the economic outlook for India is lot more positive than it is for China. As a result, the inflation picture is also radically different, as Chetan Ahya, chief Asia economist at Morgan Stanley points out:\n\nTrinh Nguyen, economist for emerging Asia at Natixis, adds that India has some tailwinds that China now lacks:\n\nAs a result, Indian bond yields have remained relatively high \u2014 the 10-year yield has dipped from above 7 per cent in the middle of 2024 to around 6.7 per cent right now \u2014 even as Chinese bond yields have puked hard.\n\nIn fact, the 10-year Chinese government bond yield is now only a whisker above 1.5 per cent, a figurative fixed income market howl that there\u2019s a danger that deflation becomes entrenched.\n\nIn a sign of how serious the situation is for China, its 30-year yield fell below that of Japan\u2019s last year, and China\u2019s 10-year government bond yield is now only 0.4 percentage point higher than that of Japan.\n\nThe United Nations predicts that India will remain the fastest growing major economy in the world, forecasting GDP growth of 6.6 per cent in 2025, even Chinese economic growth slows to 4.8 per cent.\n\nThe whole India versus China thing seems to be becoming a bit of a narrative, with UBS recently releasing a 139-page tome that compares the two countries across a range of different macro and capital market metrics. Most notably, the report predicts that India could overtake China in MSCI\u2019s equity weightings by as early as 2028.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t that long ago that people were just as bullish on China\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ff2fafa8-b285-4d18-9775-1ce039dd26de"}, {"uuid4": "5cb43a72-53bc-487f-8b8c-40946c78358b", "title": "Global hotel chains bet on cheaper end of market as Chinese economy slows", "description": "Hyatt, IHG and Radisson are expanding in China but shifting focus to more cost-conscious travellers", "author": "Tina Hu", "published_date": "2025-01-28T05:00:37.567Z", "content": "International hotel groups are increasing their presence in China, betting on the cheaper end of the market as the country\u2019s economic slowdown hurts travellers\u2019 budgets.\n\nHyatt, IHG and Radisson are among the global hotel chains expanding in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy \u2014 and converting some of the many unoccupied office blocks to hotels \u2014 as they look to target younger, more cost-conscious travellers.\n\nHyatt, the US hospitality group known for upmarket brands such as Grand Hyatt and Hyatt Regency, has about 170 of its more than 1,300 hotels in China. It plans to add another 140 in the next four years, about half of which will be part of the mid-range UrCove brand.\n\nUrCove charges about $60 a night on average for rooms in its 50-plus hotels in China, about half the cost of a night in some of the Hyatt Regency\u2019s nearly 40 hotels in the country.\n\nHyatt\u2019s focus on UrCove, a joint development with Chinese hotel chain BTG Homeinns, would allow it to expand into more cities and \u201cgrow our base\u201d, including for young domestic travellers, said Stephen Ho, who runs Hyatt\u2019s greater China business.\n\nWith Chinese companies cutting costs and trimming travel budgets, demand for expensive hotel rooms had fallen sharply in recent months, said Zhou Mingqi, founder of China-based consultancy Jingjian Consulting, which specialises in tourism and real estate.\n\n\u201c[Many] Chinese are more cautious on spending in a slower economy [but are still pursuing] quality,\u201d said Ernan Cui, a consumer market analyst at Gavekal. \u201cAs a result, mid-to-upscale hotels are favoured and would see stronger growth than [high-end luxury hotels].\u201d\n\nSome hoteliers are renting and converting empty office blocks into affordable hotels.

The group said mid-range hotels were experiencing \u201csubstantial\u201d growth in China as \u201cconsumer behaviours evolve\u201d.\n\nBelgium-based Radisson, which was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Jin Jiang International in 2018, said it was planning about 400 new hotels in China by 2030, including a large number of mid-range rooms.\n\nSome of its new hotels would be converted from office buildings, said Elie Younes, Radisson\u2019s global chief development officer. \u201cPeople in secondary cities are spending less in China, so I have to afford to build the hotel that the customer can afford,\u201d he said.\n\nAverage room rates at luxury and upscale hotels in China were down by up to 20 per cent in October compared with the previous year, said Rao Linfeng, a China-based hotel investment strategist. Overall room rates are still growing but at a slower pace this year as the post-pandemic travel demand surge loses steam and economic growth remains slow.\n\nThe decline in consumer spending at China\u2019s luxury hotels was \u201cevident\u201d, said Harlem Chow, a former executive at H World and Wyndham. \u201cFormer five-star hotel guests now choose four-star options, while four-star guests turn to upper mid-range hotels.\u201d Guests were also opting for cheaper brands and having fewer overnight stays, said Chow.\n\nAs international hotel groups target the more cost-conscious traveller, they face increased domestic competition.\n\nGroups such as H World and Atour were also investing in mid-range hotels, said Kevin Hei, business development manager at Empark Hotels & Resorts.\n\nThe higher-end market was \u201cunlikely to see a strong rebound any time soon\u201d, said Zhou of Jingjian Consulting, adding that international brands would increasingly see thin margins. \u201cUltimately, they\u2019ll have to compete just as aggressively as local brands do.\u201d", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a9d6e211-c8d0-4f5a-9d4d-2138a7c833e8"}, {"uuid4": "9eaa5da9-fdc1-43c8-80bd-6f121cfbbdeb", "title": "Middle East becomes fastest-growing renewables market outside China", "description": "UAE\u2019s Masdar and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Acwa Power lead build out of huge solar farms", "author": "Malcolm Moore", "published_date": "2025-01-28T05:00:37.561Z", "content": "Until this month, the oil-rich United Arab Emirates had modest ambitions when it came to renewable energy: to install roughly as many solar panels each year as the UK.\n\nBut then Masdar, the country\u2019s state-owned renewable energy company, decided to make a splash at a huge trade fair in Abu Dhabi.\n\nIn front of the UAE president, it announced it would build a $6bn 5 gigawatt solar plant backed with more than 19GWh of battery storage \u2014 the largest such project ever attempted.\n\nWhen it starts in two years\u2019 time, its batteries will give the country a constant output of 1GW, enough to power more than 700,000 homes without having to rely on gas-fired plants when the sun is not shining.\n\n\u201cThis will transform renewable energy into baseload energy,\u201d said Sultan Al Jaber, the chair of Masdar. \u201cIt is a first step that could become a giant leap.\u201d\n\nAs the UAE was revealing its new solar project, Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil company, announced a joint venture that would start producing lithium, a key ingredient for batteries, as early as 2027.\n\nThe two countries, and their neighbours in the Gulf, have always been able to rely on their abundant reserves of fossil fuels, and both Saudi Arabia and the UAE plan to produce significantly more oil and gas in the years ahead.\n\nBut the Gulf is also accelerating its use of renewable energy, spying an economic opportunity to use cheap solar panels, wind turbines and batteries for its domestic electricity, and freeing up more oil and gas for export.\n\n\u201cThe perfect recipe [for renewable energy] exists here,\u201d said Mazin Khan, Masdar\u2019s chief financial officer, adding that the cost of the new solar and battery plant would be, for the first time, \u201ccomparable, if not cheaper, than conventional gas\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have abundant solar resources. We have relationships with manufacturers that we can leverage to get the best price possible. The regulatory market here in the UAE is very competitive and we have a line of commercial banks queueing up to be part of the project.\u201d\n\nThe most active companies bidding for contracts to build renewable projects in the Gulf are regional players including Masdar and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Acwa Power, Asian companies such as South Korea\u2019s Kepco, Japan\u2019s Jera and China\u2019s Jinko Power, and Europe\u2019s TotalEnergies, EDF and Engie.\n\nThe wider Middle East, including Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, is far behind Europe, the US and China in using renewable energy.\n\nAccording to the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena), the Middle East has less than 1 per cent of the world\u2019s renewable capacity. But from a low base, it is also the fastest-growing region outside China, in terms of adding capacity.\n\nWith a series of huge projects, the Gulf is rapidly changing its energy mix. In five years\u2019 time, renewables will make 30 per cent of the total capacity across Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, according to data from Rystad, an energy consultancy.\n\n\u201cThey have a lot of capital now from oil and gas, and they are trying to become less reliant on any one source of energy,\u201d said Vegard Wiik Vollset, head of renewables at Rystad.\n\n\u201cIt is also an economic benefit because they already have the best conditions for solar of almost anywhere in the world, and if you can get cheaper electricity than it costs for gas, you can export the gas instead.\u201d\n\nRystad\u2019s projections are based on multiple new project announcements across the region, but the energy consultancy also adjusts its forecast to take into account that the Gulf\u2019s ambitions appear to be running ahead of reality.\n\nSaudi Arabia, for example, targets to generate 50 per cent of its electricity from renewables by 2030, requiring it to install 130GW of renewables in just a few years, enough to power about 25mn homes. \u201cThey will have to ramp up their efforts quite substantially,\u201d said Vollset.\n\n\u201c2030 is quite soon. Of course, in the Middle East the turnaround can be very quick, like the UAE project. That timeline would never happen in Europe and North America.\u201d\n\nThe drive for renewables is also being fed by ambitions to build AI data centres and fledgling plans to produce \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen \u2014 a transition fuel that is electrolysed using renewable power \u2014 and export it to countries where higher power prices make its production uncompetitive.\n\nKuwait, which only had enough renewable capacity to power a few thousand homes at the end of 2023, according to Irena, awarded a contract in July last year to US engineering firm KBR to create 17GW of renewables, or enough energy for about 500,000 homes, and 25GW of green hydrogen capacity by 2050.\n\nMost of the suppliers of green products are Chinese. At this month\u2019s trade fair, dozens of the country\u2019s leading manufacturers crammed into Abu Dhabi\u2019s National Exhibition Centre, showing off a range of products customised for the local market, such as self-cleaning solar arrays, with robots that brush away dust and sand to keep panels running efficiently.\n\n\u201cOur batteries can withstand temperatures of over 60C, and they are sand, water and wind resistant,\u201d said Yong Liu, a marketing executive at BYD, one of China\u2019s leading battery and electric car companies.\n\nBYD provided the batteries for Saudi Arabia\u2019s Bisha plant, which until the UAE\u2019s announcement, was the world\u2019s largest solar and battery project.\n\n\u201cBusiness is growing very fast here and the projects are huge,\u201d said Beijing Hyperstrong, a well-established Chinese battery company. \u201cIt is a new emerging market for us. While we already set up a presence in Europe and the US, the Middle East is equally important for us in the long run.\u201d\n\nHowever, the challenge will be for Gulf states to integrate a rapid rollout of renewables into their power grids, said Vollset. \u201cWhat they do not currently have is the infrastructure, in terms of the grid, which is built for fossil fuels, not solar power. So there\u2019s a question mark over how they overcome that obstacle.\u201d\n\nData visualisation by Will Crofton in London", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f3c69a7d-0db1-4882-8d35-02ec4c57ea53"}, {"uuid4": "a838f6f2-2ed7-42ea-abf2-0327ed5d726a", "title": "DeepSeek changes rules of AI\u2019s great game", "description": "Chinese start-up\u2019s breakthrough may be bad news for US tech giants, but could be a windfall for everyone else", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-01-27T15:29:33.269Z", "content": "It is hard to talk about 21st-century economic history without discussing the \u201cChina shock\u201d. That is the term often used to describe China\u2019s entrance into the global market, a change that brought rich countries an abundance of cheap goods, but left entire industries and workforces mothballed.\n\nDeepSeek may provide a sequel. A little-known Chinese hedge fund has thrown a grenade into the world of artificial intelligence with a large language model that, in effect, matches the market leader, Sam Altman\u2019s OpenAI, at a fraction of the cost. And while OpenAI treats its models\u2019 workings as proprietary, DeepSeek\u2019s R1 wears its technical innards on the outside, making it attractive for developers to use and build on.\n\nThings move faster in the AI age; terrifyingly so. Five of the biggest technology stocks geared to AI \u2014 chipmaker Nvidia and so-called hyperscalers Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms \u2014 collectively shed almost $750bn of market value before US markets opened on Monday. It could be particularly grim for Nvidia if it proves true that DeepSeek won without the use of its shiniest chips.\n\nInvestors in tech companies, including Europeans such as chipmaking equipment maker ASML, and energy companies that investors hoped would get a boost from fuelling data centres, are left wondering whether their investments will go up in smoke. The hyperscalers were due to plough almost $300bn into capital expenditure this year, according to Visible Alpha estimates. Analysts expect that on Wednesday, when they report earnings, Meta and Microsoft will report investment for 2024 totalling $94bn.\n\nIn truth, the game is not over. DeepSeek\u2019s actual potential is still unclear, and it has yet to achieve \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d, the humanlike state that Meta and OpenAI are pursuing. But the rules might have changed. At the very least, DeepSeek may take some of the US giants\u2019 customers. At worst, it has challenged the core belief that more hardware is the key to better AI. That principle has underpinned the market value of Silicon Valley companies as they invest hand over fist.\n\nWhat is bad for the hyperscalers could still be a windfall for everyone else. For most business users, having the absolute best model is less important than having one that\u2019s reliable and good enough. Not every driver needs a Ferrari. Advances in reasoning such as R1 could be a big step for \u201cagents\u201d that deal with customers and perform tasks in the workplace. If those are available more cheaply, corporate profitability should rise.\n\nIn that sense, this second China shock could resemble the first. It could bring not just destruction but a reshuffling \u2014 albeit a painful one for many. Researchers have estimated that for every job lost to the China shock, US households\u2019 purchasing power rose by more than $400,000.

It said chief executive Zhu Jiusheng had departed for \u201chealth reasons\u201d.\n\nThe \u201csudden and simultaneous\u201d resignations were \u201cunprecedented in recent memory\u201d for a big participant such as Vanke, said Foreky Wong, founding partner at Hong Kong advisory company Fortune Ark Restructuring.\n\nVanke said in a separate filing that it expected to have made a loss of Rmb45bn ($6.2bn) in 2024, compared with profits of Rmb12bn a year earlier, highlighting a continued decline in sales of new homes in China. The company said it was experiencing \u201ctemporary liquidity difficulties\u201d due to the loss.\n\nXin Jie, head of Shenzhen Metro, which owns about a third of Vanke, will become the company\u2019s new chair. Vanke is now set to become the latest test of authorities\u2019 willingness to support individual developers, which typically borrow heavily to finance their activities. Vanke has Rmb36bn of capital market debt coming due this year.\n\nGiven the company\u2019s well-known status in China, its struggles also pose a fresh challenge to homebuyer confidence, which remains weak despite a barrage of recent efforts from policymakers.\n\nRather than carrying out individual bailouts, Beijing has, since Evergrande\u2019s default in 2021, prioritised completing unfinished projects, reducing borrowing costs for homeowners and encouraging banks and other lenders to refinance the sector.\n\nPolicymakers unveiled vast credit lines from state-owned banks in late 2022 and, in May, announced a new policy of encouraging state-owned enterprises to buy unsold housing. However, overall investment and sales have continued to decline, weighing on China\u2019s economic momentum.\n\nZerlina Zeng, head of Asia credit strategy at CreditSights, said the crucial question was how much contagion risk Vanke\u2019s plight would create, adding that the central and local governments might not be expecting \u201cso much of a systemic impact\u201d from a restructuring.\n\n\u201cIf the market thinks otherwise and we see a funding freeze\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and that leads to banks becoming even less willing to extend money to property, even at the project level, then that would [mean] big trouble for the Chinese government,\u201d she said.\n\nThe resignations at Vanke come after a period of mounting concern over its liquidity, echoing the experience of other developers such as Country Garden in 2023.

They were in addition to a 10 per cent standard import tariff for the industry.\n\nThe anti-subsidy tariffs came after an EU investigation launched in 2023 on China\u2019s unfair support for its EV industry.

In 2018, they began rolling out a centralised drug procurement scheme, replacing a fragmented system in which hospitals negotiated individually for medical supplies.\n\nThe programme drove down costs, with the average price of some medications falling more than 50 per cent. But some of those discounts came from replacing more expensive, off-patent drugs from companies such as AstraZeneca and GSK with cheaper domestic alternatives. Patients and doctors have expressed concerns about the effectiveness of some domestic generics.\n\nIn a rare public complaint on January 16, Zheng Minhua, a senior surgeon at Shanghai\u2019s Ruijin Hospital, and 19 other prominent doctors, said it was an \u201cundeniable fact\u201d that domestic drugs showed poor efficacy with their patients, even when dosages were increased.\n\n\u201cHypertension does not drop effectively, anaesthetics do not put patients to sleep and laxatives do not cause diarrhoea,\u201d they wrote in a policy proposal submitted to Shanghai\u2019s municipal legislature and seen by the Financial Times. \u201cQuestionable drug efficacy poses the greatest safety risk to patients,\u201d they added.\n\nThe doctors called for \u201cgreater flexibility\u201d in drug contract bidding to have western brand-named drugs covered by insurance.\n\nGrowing public anger prompted the National Healthcare Security Administration to dispatch a team to Shanghai last Tuesday to examine hospital data on domestic generic prescriptions, according to a statement.\n\nThe issue of medical safety is especially sensitive in China, where past scandals over tainted infant formula and blood transfusions that had proven deadly stoked public outrage over lax regulations.\n\nChinese patients can still purchase some foreign drugs online, but they are not covered by insurance, and doctors usually do not provide advice on non-approved medication. In the procurement process for Shanghai\u2019s public health system last month, more than 20 foreign brands including Pfizer, Bayer and MSD sent bids for 32 off-patent drugs.

If Leapmotor sales grow in Europe, Stellantis could utilise more spare capacity at its own factories and avoid politically controversial closures.\n\nD\u00f6llner said Audi was also opposed to the EU\u2019s higher tariffs on Chinese-imported EVs, saying the protectionist measures would ultimately hurt its position.\n\nChina remains a crucial market for many non-Chinese carmakers, while several companies manufacture vehicles in the country and then import them back into Europe.\n\n\u201cTariffs will only block [competition] for some time and give you a wrong [sense of] security.

Instead, it has a long-term policy of allowing the Singapore dollar to gradually appreciate against other currencies.\n\nBy reducing the slope of its appreciation, the monetary authority in effect lowers borrowing rates in the city-state\u2019s heavily trade-dependent economy.\n\nThe move \u2014 the first time the MAS has loosened policy since the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020 \u2014 came after inflation data released on Thursday showed the city-state\u2019s core consumer price index rose 1.8 per cent in December from a year earlier, the second consecutive month of growth below 2 per cent.\n\nThe central bank also lowered its inflation forecast for 2025 to between 1 and 2 per cent, down from 1.5 to 2.5 per cent in October.

More than 1,000 employees could be affected, and the tax difference could be as high as 21 percentage points depending on individual salaries, as both countries have a tiered tax structure.\n\nSingapore has emerged as a regional hub for many Chinese companies looking to expand into south-east Asia and globally. Tech giants Alibaba, Tencent and PDD, as well as start-ups such as Shein, have set up offices in the city-state, where lower tax rates have convinced many Chinese workers to relocate.\n\nChina in recent years has increased efforts to collect tax revenue to fill government coffers, including demanding wealthy individuals and companies double-check for unpaid liabilities, amid a broad economic slowdown.\n\nIn 2019, Beijing revised its income tax rules to allow authorities to collect revenue from Chinese expats, similar to US rules on Americans living abroad, but it has not enforced them rigorously. Most Chinese citizens working abroad only need to report their taxable income on a voluntary basis, and Beijing has not outlined consequences for those who do not.\n\nFor higher-paid workers at ByteDance, the potential difference could be massive.

It has been 60 years since Malaysia expelled Singapore from its federation, forcing the latter into independence as a city-state amid racial tensions and political clashes between both sides.\n\nFor most of the past six decades, the two countries have viewed each other with suspicion and been locked in a deep rivalry, one in which Singapore, Malaysia\u2019s biggest trading partner, has been the clear victor. It has established itself as a global trading and finance hub, with GDP a head of $94,000 compared with Malaysia\u2019s $14,400.\n\nBut Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House this week, his promise to implement a spate of tariffs and a slowing Chinese economy have made Malaysia and Singapore look to strengthen ties.\n\n\u201cGenerations of Malaysian and Singaporean leaders had to manage [this rivalry] and that stopped us from doing what is common sense to everyone, which is to integrate Singapore and Johor better,\u201d Malaysian economy minister Rafizi Ramli told the FT, referring to the Malaysian state bordering Singapore. \u201cOperating as nearly an economic unit will offer investors the best of both worlds.\u201d\n\nModelled on China\u2019s Shenzhen special economic zone, which borders Hong Kong, but is twice its size, the JSSEZ is central to Malaysia\u2019s ambitions to build on its 5 per cent economic growth last year.\n\nMalaysia has already positioned its economy to play a key role in the global demand for artificial intelligence, from developing one of Asia\u2019s biggest semiconductor hubs in the northern island of Penang over several decades, to more recently welcoming big tech companies to set up data centres in the south.\n\nIt has also benefited from \u201cChina plus one\u201d, a strategy in which multinational companies complement their Chinese operations with investments in regional countries to diversify risk and lower costs.\n\nThe government hopes the JSSEZ will add $26bn a year to its economy by 2030, bringing in 20,000 skilled jobs and 50 new projects.\n\nIt has offered generous corporate tax rates of just 5 per cent for 15 years for companies investing in areas such as AI and quantum computing, as well as manufacturing high-end equipment. That compares with typical rates of 15-24 per cent in Malaysia and lows of 17 per cent in Singapore.\n\nJohor has already been a critical engine for the Malaysian economy in recent years, thanks in part to its pro-business sultan becoming the country\u2019s king a year ago.\n\nThe state has emerged as a global hub for data centres, drawing in more than $25bn of investment from the likes of Nvidia, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance and creating 35,000 jobs.\n\nWhile Johor provides plenty of cheap land, water, energy and labour to develop the projects, Singapore offers an entry point for investors.\n\n\u201cConceptually [the special economic zone] has the ability to leverage Singapore\u2019s global finance and logistics centre capabilities with Johor\u2019s access to competitive land, labour and energy to deliver a differentiated proposition \u2014 especially for supply chains looking for alternatives to north Asia amid the US-China trade war,\u201d said Maybank analyst Thilan Wickramasinghe.\n\nBut it is not just big tech companies the JSSEZ is aimed at attracting.

I had a terrific evening yesterday at a London production of Kyoto, a new play that brings to life the first decade of international climate negotiations \u2014 and the oil industry machinations that sought to undermine them. It\u2019s a fast-paced, innovative staging that conveys the raw intensity of climate diplomacy, and the tremendously high stakes involved. Don\u2019t take my word for it: here\u2019s the lowdown from the FT\u2019s theatre critic.\n\nOne of the key flashpoints in the play is the intense argument at the 1997 Kyoto summit over carbon offset trading. Almost three decades on, the controversy around carbon markets has only grown. But as we highlight in today\u2019s newsletter, some investors are still seeing opportunities in the troubled sector.\n\nReports of the death of the voluntary carbon market may yet prove exaggerated. The $32mn funding round announced yesterday by London-based carbon credit rating agency BeZero Carbon would be seen as small beer in some industries. But for the carbon credit sector, battered over the past two years by a reputational crisis and a fundraising drought, it looks like a noteworthy shot in the arm.\n\nBeZero\u2019s fundraising provides fresh evidence of the outsized role that Singapore has taken in the carbon credit market. The lead investor is GenZero, launched in 2022 with $3.6bn of committed capital from Temasek, Singapore\u2019s $288bn sovereign wealth fund.\n\nFrom the start, GenZero has had a mandate to invest in promoting carbon market development as one of its three core focus areas \u2014 alongside the related field of nature-based projects, and broader climate technology. \u201cWe think the journey towards net zero will be impossible without effective carbon markets,\u201d chief executive Frederick Teo told me.\n\nTeo said the investment in BeZero reflected the need for transparent and reliable data that would allow buyers to identify high-quality credits and regain confidence in the market. Transaction value in the voluntary carbon market fell from $2.1bn in 2021 to $723mn in 2023, according to Ecosystem Marketplace. Separate data from MSCI shows that volumes and prices remained depressed last year. Corporate buyers have taken fright at media and academic allegations that many projects have hugely exaggerated their carbon benefits.\n\nTommy Ricketts, BeZero\u2019s chief executive, said the company had about 150 clients for its credit ratings and broader market data, assembled by a full-time employee base that included 77 scientists. Ricketts added that, given BeZero\u2019s leading role in ratings and the industry\u2019s growing emphasis on transparency, an investment in BeZero amounted to \u201ca leveraged play\u201d on the future growth of the carbon market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just about waiting for that inflection, that catalyst, whatever it may be,\u201d Ricketts said.\n\nWill that wait pay off? If this market does return to growth, Singapore will deserve a share of the credit. Singaporean companies can now use carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their liabilities under its national carbon tax regime. That tax currently stands at about S$25 ($18.30) a tonne \u2014 a quarter of the price under the EU\u2019s emissions trading scheme \u2014 but is set to rise significantly in the next few years.\n\nThis means that, unlike most other governments, Singapore has given its companies a real economic incentive to invest in carbon credits. It\u2019s taken a fairly careful approach on which sorts of credits can be used, setting out minimum standards and forming agreements with individual countries on the use of projects in their jurisdictions.\n\nAll this, Ricketts argued, was part of a push by Singapore to become \u201cthe hub of carbon\u201d \u2014 a bet that, despite its current travails, the carbon credit market could become one of real economic significance, and that this entrepreneurial city-state could become its global centre of gravity.\n\nIf that is indeed the strategy, GenZero appears to be its financial spearhead. The fund has made a series of investments in carbon credit companies \u2014 notably in Climate Impact X, a Singapore-based carbon marketplace. Other investments have included South Pole, one of the largest carbon credit consultancies, and Perennial, which uses machine learning and remote sensing to assess the carbon impact of soil projects.\n\nAll these companies have been affected by the headwinds assailing the sector \u2014 notably South Pole, which has been embroiled in some of the more high-profile controversies over project quality.\n\nBut Teo \u2014 along with GenZero\u2019s financial backer, the Singaporean government \u2014 is betting that a turnaround in the market will come in due course. The integration of carbon credits in mandatory carbon pricing schemes, as pioneered by Singapore, is one potential driver of demand. Another is a major change in the international rules for airlines: from 2027, nearly all of them will be required to buy carbon credits unless they achieve big emission reductions.\n\nThen there is the long-awaited international carbon trading mechanism that was promised in the text of the 2015 Paris Agreement. At November\u2019s COP29 in Baku, a basic agreement on what credits could be used in this mechanism was hailed by some as a breakthrough, though there remains a huge amount of work to do before that system will be up and running.\n\nAll this may sound far too optimistic to the many who see the voluntary carbon market as a busted flush. And unless the market can address the serious concerns that have been raised around quality and integrity , it is highly questionable whether its growth will be beneficial to the global struggle against climate change.\n\nBut Singapore clearly thinks this sector is worth a punt, albeit a fairly modest one by the standards of the huge sums deployed by its sovereign investment funds. It\u2019s also an opportunity to strengthen its ties with developing nations around the world, which are home to the bulk of carbon credit projects.\n\nWith the clear mandate and stable funding that he\u2019s been given by the government, Teo is able to be far more patient than most investors in this space. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a constructive view of carbon markets for the long term,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt would be naive to imagine things will be hunky-dory in 2025 or 2026.\u201d\n\nNew era How will sustainable investing survive the return of Donald Trump?\n\nExpensive medicine EU pollution rules could force European carmakers to pay large sums to Chinese rivals for carbon credits.\n\nDamage limitation Reinsurance companies may absorb less than 3 per cent of insured losses from the Los Angeles fires, having cut their risk exposure in recent years.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e97dd32a-7c46-4d59-bbd5-20ad8bc6571d"}, {"uuid4": "a2c20b7e-27e3-4091-ae4c-c02836696b9d", "title": "British activist investor seeks to disrupt Singapore\u2019s Great Eastern takeover", "description": "Palliser Capital accuses OCBC of treating insurer\u2019s minority shareholders unfairly as activist campaigns pick up in Asia", "author": "Owen Walker", "published_date": "2025-01-15T05:00:27.195Z", "content": "A British activist investor has appealed to Singapore\u2019s markets regulator to intervene in the takeover of an insurer by the city-state\u2019s second-biggest bank, calling the deal \u201cgravely unfair\u201d for shareholders.\n\nThe move by Palliser Capital, which has taken on several high-profile companies since its founders broke away from Elliott four years ago, is the latest in a wave of activist campaigns in Asia in the past year.\n\nThere were 57 campaigns against Asian companies in 2024, up from a previous record of 44 the year before, according to Lazard, with Japanese groups Sumitomo Corporation, SoftBank and Nissan all being targeted in the past six months.\n\nGreat Eastern is Singapore\u2019s oldest and largest life insurer. Palliser, which has a stake in Great Eastern, has accused OCBC of treating minority shareholders unfairly in its attempted full takeover of the company.\n\nIn letters sent to the Monetary Authority of Singapore and SGX stock exchange, seen by the Financial Times, the activist accused the Great Eastern board of being \u201chighly complacent\u201d in recommending the offer.\n\nIt added that the insurer\u2019s \u201ccorporate governance safeguards designed to protect the interests of minority shareholders were lacking or insufficiently robust\u201d.\n\nIn response, the MAS and SGX told Palliser they were monitoring the case and engaging with both sides, according to communications seen by the FT.\n\nGreat Eastern, which has more than S$100bn (US$73bn) in assets and 16mn policyholders in Singapore and Malaysia, has been part-owned by OCBC since 1958. A minority of shares, about 6 per cent, are listed on Singapore\u2019s stock exchange.\n\nIn 2008, OCBC increased its stake in the insurer to 87 per cent and announced a voluntary offer in May last year to take full control of the business for S$1.4bn, or S$25.60 a share, a 37 per cent premium on the share price at the time.\n\nEY provided a valuation to the insurer, which put it at a range of S$28.87 to S$36.19 a share, though Palliser believes it should be higher.\n\nThe activist argued that senior Great Eastern executives and board members \u2014 several of whom are former OCBC executives \u2014 had conflicts of interest because they received a large proportion of their pay in the bank\u2019s stock and therefore benefited from a lower offer price.\n\nPalliser complained to the MAS about the Great Eastern board\u2019s refusal to meet the activist investor over the issue.\n\n\u201cGreat Eastern\u2019s seeming unwillingness to engage with us in any meaningful sense has added to our sense of unease and frustration and made us determined to ensure that the interests of Great Eastern\u2019s remaining minority shareholders are safeguarded,\u201d the investor wrote.\n\nForeign activist forays are relatively rare in Singapore, which prides itself on being a business-friendly financial hub. But several recent cases have led to Swiss and Australian activists pushing for better deals for minority shareholders in takeover deals.\n\nMany of the campaigns against Asian companies are focused on breaking up multi-industry conglomerates, with Asia-Pacific catching up with Europe as the second most active region behind the US.\n\nAmong Palliser\u2019s recent campaigns are a move to force Rio Tinto to abandon its primary London listing and consolidate its Australian business, as well as pushing for change at a Japanese property company and a rail operator with a stake in Tokyo Disneyland\u2019s owner.\n\nPalliser, OCBC, the MAS and SGX declined to comment on the Great Eastern campaign.

The figure has been in steady decline since hitting a high of 782 in 2013, with domestic companies attracted to overseas listings, especially in larger and more heavily traded markets such as the US.\n\n\u201cI surely hope that this year is a low point,\u201d said Clifford Lee, head of the investment bank at DBS, south-east Asia\u2019s biggest lender and Singapore\u2019s most valuable public company. \u201cIt\u2019s a result of various factors coming together.\u201d\n\nShein, the Chinese fast-fashion business based in Singapore since 2022, is considering a London listing with a potential \u00a350bn market valuation, which would make it one of the UK\u2019s largest public companies. Several of Singapore\u2019s best-known businesses, including superapp Grab and ecommerce group Sea, have opted for New York listings in recent years.\n\nSingapore has benefited from a flood of private capital flowing into the city-state, which has coincided with a burgeoning family office sector, while the SGX has also built up strong bond trading, derivatives and real estate investment trust markets. But it has struggled to repeat that growth with initial public offerings.\n\nOver the summer, the Monetary Authority of Singapore launched a review of the country\u2019s equity markets, with a panel that included the heads of the SGX, monetary authority and Temasek, the state-owned investment company.\n\nThe group is due to report its findings next August and has so far discussed ways of attracting more fund managers to invest in the stock market in order to address demand issues, while relaxing some disclosure rules and investor safeguards to encourage more companies to list, according to a person involved in the talks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chicken and an egg situation,\u201d the person said. \u201cWe have to make it attractive for good companies to list and see more fund managers in the market, and they will only be attracted by the prospect of investing in good companies.\u201d\n\nThe regulator said in a statement: \u201cMany ideas have been surfaced as the review group is engaging broadly with many groups of stakeholders and the review group discussions are still ongoing.\u201d\n\nSeveral investment bankers told the Financial Times that 2024 was likely to be the nadir for listings in Singapore due to the political uncertainty of general elections around the world. They said there was pent-up demand, and they were working on several IPOs for next year.\n\nThe four companies that went public with a primary listing on the SGX this year \u2014 all of which were on the junior Catalist market \u2014 had a combined IPO value of just $31mn and included a chain of karaoke bars and an operator of Japanese restaurants.\n\nThe largest company to list, the Singapore Institute of Advanced Medicine healthcare group, has shed 71 per cent of its market value since its March IPO after reporting heavy losses. Its auditor, PwC, raised questions about its ability to continue as a going concern over the summer.\n\nStock markets around the world \u2014 notably London \u2014 have struggled to attract listings in the face of fierce competition and high valuations in the US. The amount raised through IPOs across south-east Asia this year is the lowest in at least 10 years, according to Dealogic.\n\nEven so, Malaysia has had 46 IPOs this year, compared with 39 in Indonesia and 28 in Thailand. While the Philippines had just three listings, their total value of $197mn far outpaced Singapore\u2019s $31mn.\n\nMost of the companies that listed in other south-east Asian markets were domestic, whereas Singapore is positioning itself as a global hub for international public companies.\n\n\u201cThe strategic infrastructure is here, the liquidity available in the market to invest in new listings is here,\u201d said DBS\u2019s Lee, who is involved in the MAS review. \u201cNow we need a good supply of companies choosing to list. We have a healthy pipeline for the year ahead. It\u2019s like a well-oiled, sleek machine that hasn\u2019t been used.\u201d\n\nOne option often mooted is whether to allow Singapore\u2019s compulsory savings system \u2014 the Central Provident Fund, typically used to finance retirement, healthcare and property purchases \u2014 to invest more in the domestic stock market.\n\n\u201cThat would create new pools of money to help drive up multiples and would probably spark IPOs,\u201d said Jayden Vantarakis, head of south-east Asian equities research at Macquarie, who covers the SGX.\n\nBut he doubts that such reforms will materialise and downgraded the SGX from \u201coutperform\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d in November, partly on expectations that the MAS review would fail to prevent the decline in listings.\n\nAdditional reporting

"published_date": "2024-12-06T05:00:17.143Z", "content": "A flurry of new exchange traded funds are set to be added to the master-feeder scheme linking Singapore and Chinese exchanges that has seen slow take-up since its launch at the end of 2021.\n\nFund firms in the two markets have faced difficulties in agreeing commercial partnerships and China\u2019s slumping markets have also slowed the product pipeline for the scheme, which allows investors access to ETFs cross-listed between the Singapore, Shenzhen and Shanghai bourses.\n\nBut while only seven ETFs have been launched on the scheme up to end-November, including partnerships between UOB Asset Management and Ping An Fund Management, and CSOP Asset Management and PineBridge Investments, a turnaround could be on the cards.\n\nEarlier this month, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said it was in discussions with its Chinese counterpart to expand the number of ETFs on the cross-listing scheme.\n\nRussell Wang, head of securitised products for global markets at the Singapore Exchange, said the expectation of further government reforms and a rebound in China\u2019s onshore markets meant ETF issuers were now preparing more products to be rolled out next year.\n\n\u201cBefore September, weak investor sentiment towards Chinese equities slowed down developments in the pipeline as issuers were less certain about demand for new ETF listings,\u201d said Wang.\n\nBut since the Chinese stock market rallied in October, investors had been getting back into the market, showing greater appetite for investing offshore, and issuers were responding and preparing to meet this change in demand, Wang said.\n\nWang now expects three to four new ETFs to be added to the cross-link scheme in the first half of 2025.\n\nThis is in addition to a new emerging Asia ETF from Singapore\u2019s Lion Global Investors and Shenzhen-based China Merchants Fund Management that will be listed on December 11.\n\nBefore the Lion Global and China Merchants ETF, the last fund to be launched as part of the scheme was a Phillip Capital and China Universal Asset Management ETF that was rolled out in March.\n\nThis boost in investor appetite has also translated to an uptick in flows for ETFs available on the Singapore-China link.\n\nAssets in the scheme grew by S$24mn ($17.9mn) in September and October, accounting for nearly 80 per cent of total asset growth in the preceding 12 months, according to the SGX.\n\nChinese investors accounted for 70 per cent of total flows, indicating interest among onshore investors for Singapore-listed ETFs.\n\nWang expects that overall Chinese investor sentiment is likely to pick up if the Chinese government is more proactive in supporting the market in light of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in the US.\n\nWing Chan, head of manager research for Asia Pacific at Morningstar, said Chinese domestic investors still had untapped demand for wider offshore exposure, which the Singapore-China ETF link could provide.\n\nHistorically, much of the offshore access has been via Hong Kong channels and Hong Kong products, he said, but many of these actually still invest in Chinese assets.\n\nIn addition to market performance factors, misalignment between partner fund firms in the scheme, particularly around commercial terms, has been a key reason behind the heretofore slow uptake in the scheme.\n\n\u201cFor many of the issuers, they have limited experience working on a partnership with a Chinese asset manager, and vice versa,\u201d said SGX\u2019s Wang.\n\nThe part that took up the most time was usually around the \u201cbilateral discussion to agree on the commercial terms\u201d, such as who would drive fundraising and flows, and the overall objective of the partnership, he noted.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

Here you can find Nigerian textile traders rubbing shoulders with burly fishmongers expertly filleting tunas, or\u00a0sample myriad olives and cheeses from\u00a0the island\u2019s hinterland. My grandfather taught me to come early, and\u00a0make a beeline for the cart selling steaming slices of sfincione (a focaccia-like bread served\u00a0with oregano, anchovies and\u00a0caciocavallo cheese). Ben Marino\n\nInspired by the designs of one of the city\u2019s most famous sons, Gustave Eiffel, this Dijon market is a vaulted, ironwork theatre of Burgundian gastronomy. Four days a week, Les Halles hums with local producers selling Charolais beef for the classic b\u0153uf \u00e0\u00a0la bourguignonne, giant wheels of Comt\u00e9 cheese from the nearby Jura, as well as the wines, more cheeses, chickens, mushrooms, snails and mustards for which the region is famed. John Thornhill\n\nChapel Market is part of my life, my identity. It\u2019s always felt under threat but\u00a0never died \u2013 it really is the place where\u00a0everyone knows your name. It is\u00a0where\u00a0you\u00a0go for last glimpses of a mixed\u00a0London\u00a0community with some good\u00a0veg and excellent chat.

Juliet Riddell\n\nFor more than a century, Grand Central Market in Los Angeles\u2019s downtown historic district has celebrated the city\u2019s many food\u00a0cultures under one roof. While legacy vendors such as China Cafe (c1959), best known for its huge bowls of wonton soup and off-menu egg rolls, reign on, in recent years a host of new businesses has been welcomed into the fold, from Lucky Bird, the market\u2019s first and only stall dedicated to fried chicken and its accoutrements (read: waffles dripping in syrup) to award-winning smashburgers at For The Win. Not to be missed: the all-day breakfast burritos at\u00a0Jose\u00a0Chiquito. In\u00e8s Cross\n\nOne of this famously gastronomic city\u2019s largest markets opened in 1859 and\u00a0was\u00a0renamed after the late chef Paul\u00a0Bocuse, a native son, in 2006 following a\u00a0total\u00a0renovation. Today it covers\u00a0three floors with more than 13,500sq m, and is home\u00a0to\u00a054 stalls and restaurants. Don\u2019t\u00a0miss Mons fromager, one of the best cheesemongers in France; Patisserie Seve for a sticky pink tarte aux pralines; and Bobosse for Lyonnais charcuterie like plump pistachio-studded fresh sausage. Great eats on the spot include Baba La\u00a0Grenouille for frogs\u2019 legs en persillade and\u00a0Chez Les Gones for local comfort food\u00a0like quenelles de brochet (pike dumplings). Alexander Lobrano\n\nAt this, one of the biggest food markets in\u00a0Europe, more\u00a0than 1,200 stalls sell everything from\u00a0fresh fruit, meat, cheese and live eels.\u00a0Forage for\u00a0a picnic lunch, admire the\u00a0stained-glass windows or spend\u00a0the\u00a0afternoon sipping cold beer and\u00a0eating\u00a0a\u00a0loin sandwich at Richard Camarena\u2019s Central Bar. Sally Hickey\n\n\u201cPeaceful\u201d is the last word most would use to describe Singapore\u2019s hawker markets. That\u2019s why locals often skip the more famous ones in the central area for East Coast Lagoon Food Village, in one of the city-state\u2019s largest beach parks. There you can find food-market staples including satay, sugar-cane juice and Hainanese chicken rice, plus seafood specialities such as chilli crab and fried oysters, all served with ocean views. Taylor Nicole Rogers\n\nDubbed the chicest market in Paris by Le Figaro, this lively open-air market is popular with Parisian chefs for the exceptional quality of stands such as Le\u00a0Bar\u00a0\u00e0 Patates, which specialises in\u00a0potatoes, mushrooms and fresh herbs,\u00a0and La Bergerie du Mesnil, run by\u00a0Sandy Brown McKeen, an Irish farmer who lives in Normandy and produces exceptional yoghurt, cream, milk, and meat.\u00a0La Maison Priolet is also renowned for its game and high-quality poultry. A\u00a0variety of food stands serve food to eat on the hoof,\u00a0such as grilled Lebanese bread and Breton\u00a0cr\u00eapes, plus juicy rotisserie chickens\u00a0that make for a great picnic or fast\u00a0meal in a holiday flat. AL\n\nUnder the deep shade of century-old plane\u00a0trees, dotted across the central town\u00a0square, market traders from surrounding villages sell local produce. Bellows cheese made in an identical way\u00a0since\u00a0the 14th century, renowned Herzegovinian wine, honey, medicinal herbs and prosciutto are just a few of the delights on offer. After food tasting and shopping, visitors sit in the caf\u00e9s on the square to cool down with a lemonade and enjoy people-watching. Tatjana Mitevska\n\nTsukiji has got everything, from unctuous otoro to the ethically questionable (but legal) whale skewers. Try a hearty bowl of beef intestine and miso stew at Kitsuneya. Then head to Iroha for mochi topped with giant strawberries, especially if the Amaou variety is in season. For post-prandial coffee, grab a cup of City Blend at John Lennon\u2019s go-to shop Yonemoto. Kristine Ching\n\nWith more than 200 vendors selling everything from passion fruit to poke bowls, this indoor-outdoor market is a\u00a0vibrant must-experience on Hawaii\u2019s Big\u00a0Island. With special sections for tropical\u00a0plants (orchids and anthuriums are\u00a0abundant), macadamia nuts and artisanal oils, as well as colourful sarongs and hand-carved wooden accessories, this\u00a0is a one-stop-shop. Be sure to sample\u00a0the fruits of the season \u2013 white pineapples, thimble berries, strawberry papayas, guavas \u2013 and the local Kona coffee, preferably on Wednesdays and Saturdays when the market is particularly popping. Christina Ohly Evans\n\nThe glass-walled market hall in the centre of town offers a taste of Copenhagen\u2019s culinary prowess. Both a food market and an incubator for chefs, Torvehallerne is home to more than 60 restaurant stalls and purveyors of artisanal food and drink, flowers, plants and kitchen tools. Danish specialities are plenty: rows of sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d with kaleidoscopic toppings, artfully folded pastries and dense rye breads. Cuisines from around the world are also well represented, from Spanish tapas to Mexican tacos to Chinese cr\u00eapes. Though on a cold day, it\u2019s the fresh pasta at Il Mattarello that really makes my heart sing. NB\n\nN\u00eemes\u2019 elegant 19th-century glass-and-steel market pavilion was replaced by a modern cement structure in the 1970s, but\u00a0this did nothing to dent the passion of\u00a0the food-loving N\u00eemois. Visit Nadal, a century-old coffee roaster; Les Fromages de\u00a0Sylvain, for his excellent selection of cheeses and wonderful sense of humour; and the new stall selling brandade de N\u00eemes, the creamy garlicky salt-cod preparation that\u2019s the city\u2019s best-known dish. Plan on lunch at La Pie Qui Couette, a\u00a0counter-seating, lunch-only restaurant that\u2019s hugely popular for its cuisine du march\u00e9 menu, but get there early. AL\n\nTucked away in one corner of the old stone town, this small market offers an unusual mix of high-quality continental and Mediterranean food. Located at the entry of\u00a0Montenegro Boka Bay, it is supplied by\u00a0tropical fruit grown in villages on the\u00a0coast, such as fortunela, oranges, pomegranate, lemons and kiwis, as well as\u00a0fresh seafood. Farmers from villages in\u00a0the\u00a0mountains surrounding the town bring traditional authentic produce such as\u00a0the renowned prosciutto from Njegu\u0161i, potatoes from Kru\u0161evice, goat\u2019s cheese, wild asparagus and wild garlic. TM\n\nThis is in my hometown, and it certainly beats more renowned markets like La Boqueria. It\u2019s a combination of great food stalls, particularly Asian, veggie shopping for the ordinary person and lot of foodie-type stalls. It\u2019s a tale of a market that can\u00a0provide a focus for a city and enrich it\u00a0\u2013 and a tale of the integration of the various tides of immigrants from Italy and\u00a0Greece in the postwar period, Vietnamese, Cambodians and Lebanese in\u00a0the 1970s and \u201980s and Chinese and Indians more recently. Tony Tassell\n\nWest Philadelphia converges with Pennsylvania\u2019s yeoman tradition at the Clark\u00a0Park Farmers\u2019 Market. Every Saturday, Amish farmers hawk their produce across from West Philly and East Kensington businesses selling pound cakes or seafood. One can enjoy new Philadelphia favourites Nilaa Coffee, Aaji\u2019s Kitchen or Lost Bread or just as easily buy preserves and cheese from a family-owned farm, in a space that is testament to Philadelphia\u2019s shifting yet venerable culinary\u00a0scene. Aiden Reiter\n\nThis is the largest and cheapest market in the city, with its home in the garden of the Gunduli\u0107 summer villa. Locals come early in\u00a0the morning to buy fresh fish straight off the boats from the Elafiti islands. Farmers from Dubrovnik\u2019s Konavle suburb sell a wide selection of their organic produce here\u00a0throughout the day. Traditional local delicacies such as dried figs, candied orange peel, extra-virgin olive oil and quince jelly are also available as souvenirs for visitors. TM\n\nThis is the most popular and the best-stocked food market in the Serbian capital. Located in Vra\u010dar in the heart of the city, it\u00a0is named after Vlajko Kaleni\u0107, who donated the land on which it was built almost a century ago. A vast variety of\u00a0produce, from home-distilled brandy rakija,\u00a0kaymak cheese and fruit and vegetables to cured meats and spices, is on\u00a0display on stalls where sellers and buyers haggle, joke and even sing. Many locals tell me they change their walking routes just to enjoy\u00a0the splendid site of colourful stalls\u00a0full of fragrant produce. TM\n\nDescribed by the preeminent Breton chef Olivier Roellinger as \u201cthe best larder in Brittany\u201d, the second-largest food market in France was founded in 1622. Some 300 stalls sell everything from seafood landed only hours earlier to Roscoff onions, big\u00a0snowy cauliflowers, dozens of apple varieties, honey and other foods that comprise what Roellinger describes as \u201cthe\u00a0Celtic diet\u201d. Treat yourself to a grilled pork sausage rolled up in a hot buckwheat galette, the city\u2019s favourite market snack, to\u00a0fortify yourself before shopping. AL\n\nThe largest market of its kind in the southern hemisphere is a cornerstone of Australia\u2019s gourmet tourist trade, with a vast array of fresh fish and seafood on show \u2013 including oddities like blood cockles and Moreton Bay Bugs \u2013 and sushi, oysters, fish and chips and lobsters served on site. The famous blue-coloured market building, located in Pyrmont to the west of the centre of the city, is set to move next year but only\u00a0by a few hundred metres into a new purpose-built facility. Nic Fildes\n\nEvery Saturday in Athens, the historic anarchist district of Exarchia hosts a farmers\u2019 market, which runs along Kallidromiou under the famous graffitied steps. Musicians play traditional Greek music as sellers flaunt their wares: olive oil, honey and an assortment of fresh fish, herbs and vegetables. While Exarchia has been gentrified over the past few decades, and police tensions have amplified since the\u00a0building of a new metro station nearby, the market remains a touchstone in the neighbourhood: a place where students, anarchists, artists and academics meld with\u00a0tourists. Lucinda Smyth\n\nThis bustling Old Delhi bazaar is a maze of streets and narrow alleys, with the iconic Red Fort at its eastern end. Enormous piles\u00a0of cardamom and cloves, dried fruit and nuts, Kashmiri saffron and every imaginable street food \u2013 curries, roti, samosas and kebabs \u2013 send smells wafting\u00a0through the thick air. Of special note are\u00a0the stalls offering sweets including\u00a0mango-stuffed kulfi, crispy fried\u00a0jalebi and\u00a0Karachi halwa. COE\n\nA favourite of Mexico City chefs, Mercado San Juan is packed with every ingredient you might need, and plenty you don\u2019t. Stalls\u00a0in the downtown market sell everything from pitaya, clams and cacao fruit to dozens of varieties of chilies. It\u2019s also a frequent stop for food-tour groups ogling a selection of more exotic choices, including an array of protein-packed scorpions and crocodile meat. For the less adventurous, there are plenty of wine and\u00a0cheese options. Christine Murray\n\nThe aroma of frying doughnuts and brewing coffee wafts over the market as tourists and locals alike pick through acres of fresh fruit and vegetable stands. The bustling meat, seafood and cheese halls are chock-a-block with people trying tastes of Australian and\u00a0farther-flung specialities. Officially opened in 1878, the \u201cQueen Vic\u201d draws 10 million visitors annually. More than 600 food and\u00a0non-food stalls are open five days a\u00a0week, and there\u2019s a weekly night market focusing on street food, live entertainment and crafts. Brooke Masters\n\nThe 1890s Liberty-style market of the Tuscan port city of Livorno is a vibrant and down-to-earth place to savour torta di\u00a0ceci (chickpea flour flatbread), fresh oysters shucked on the spot or acciughe alla povera (fresh marinated anchovies). Visit speciality food shops (one is devoted entirely to prized Livornese hens\u2019\u00a0eggs), then ogle the stalls showing off the Ligurian Sea\u2019s bounty while\u00a0you plan dinner \u2013 the earlier you arrive, the better. Emiko Davies\n\nFor anyone with a serious sweet tooth, this sprawling, sugar-filled mega-market is worth a detour. Start a market tour with the\u00a0local delicacy ate (ah-tay) \u2013 slow-cooked guava, pear and quince that are served in jellied, chilli-powder-dusted cubes and chunks of crystallised pineapple and pumpkin. Morelianas, one of the most iconic candies, are rich caramel discs that are found next to chocolate balls and jars of\u00a0cajeta, a favoured spread for breads or served over ice cream. COE\n\nThe Ningxia Night Market is relatively small compared to the island\u2019s other sprawling competitors, but it is mighty. Its oyster omelette shop is famous and well worth a\u00a0visit, but if you want to avoid the queues,\u00a0there are plenty of other treats to indulge in. Seek out the deep-fried taro balls, stinky tofu and the unsung hero of desserts: the ice-cream wrap with peanut candy shavings and coriander. Go hungry, leave full. Eleanor Olcott\n\nThousands of eateries comprise this sprawling soul-food mecca, offering\u00a0everything from kimchi dumplings\u00a0to steaming bowls of bibimbap\u00a0and noodles that are perfect for slurping, grilled meat and mung-bean pancakes. Pull up a plastic\u00a0stool in the food court and absorb the energy of the many hawkers \u2013 and a sea of voracious eaters savouring local delicacies. The market features an\u00a0area dedicated to clothing and\u00a0home goods\u00a0as well, and it\u2019s the ideal place to\u00a0buy\u00a0an exquisite silk hanbok (traditional\u00a0Korean dress). COE\n\nA highlight of the New York summer is\u00a0the\u00a0Queens Night Market, a nocturnal\u00a0festival attracting more than 60\u00a0independent food and art vendors. Located\u00a0in Flushing, it begins in April, and\u00a0continues until October. From early evening until midnight, visitors can sample\u00a0street food from across the globe, and unlike many glossy food-stall markets, the food vendor prices are capped at $6.

The 82-year-old was sentenced in November to 17 and a half years in jail in a ruling the judge said was designed to act as a \u201cdeterrent\u201d. Lim\u2019s defence lawyer has appealed, citing his wheelchair-bound client\u2019s age and poor health.\n\nThe tough sentencing exemplifies how Singapore has tried to crack down on dodgy dealing in its commodities market. It has launched initiatives aimed at digitising the documentation that is the backbone of the commodities market, while encouraging wider information sharing among market players to prevent fraud.\n\n\u201cSingapore has realised they need to step up and rebuild some credibility,\u201d said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert, founding partner of Lambert Commodities, a consultancy. \u201cThey are taking these scandals more seriously.\u201d\n\nSingapore owes its reputation as a global commodities hub to its position on sea lanes that connect China with global markets, along with its government\u2019s business-friendly approach.\n\nGlobal trading houses including Trafigura, Vitol Group, Gunvor and Mercuria all have bases in the city, which is Asia\u2019s largest oil trading hub and one of the largest in the world for trading agricultural commodities. The city state has also set its sights on becoming a hub for rapidly growing carbon trading.\n\nIts need to set itself apart has become more acute after Dubai\u2019s rapid rise as a commodities trading hub, especially for Russian goods under sanctions by western governments.\n\n\u201cThe long arc of global history is full of stories of ports that have flourished and thrived for decades, only to decline amidst changing circumstances,\u201d said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong during an event at Singapore\u2019s mega Tuas Port project in October. \u201cThe lesson is that we cannot be complacent.\u201d\n\nThe Lim case, along with several others in Singapore, came to light in 2020, when commodity prices slumped at the outbreak of the pandemic. Lim\u2019s company, Hin Leong, collapsed in April 2020 and he admitted hiding $800mn in losses from creditors, which included some of the world\u2019s biggest banks.\n\nHis was the largest of several trading houses in the city state that imploded that year. Others included the oil dealer ZenRock and Agritrade International, a trader accused of fraud by its lenders. Hontop Energy, the trading arm of a Shandong-based refiner, went into receivership and was accused by its biggest lender of \u201csuspicious transactions\u201d.\n\nA common theme of the scandals was dubious paperwork, used to secure credit from financial institutions in order to hide losses and make leveraged bets on commodity prices. Banks were willing to lend to the traders in expectation of chunky fees.\n\n\u201cPaper documents have always been the Achilles heel of international trade,\u201d said Baldev Bhinder, managing director of Blackstone & Gold, a specialist energy and commodities law firm in Singapore.\n\nLim was found guilty of encouraging his executives to forge two documents that purported to be oil sales contracts, which led to HSBC disbursing nearly $112mn to the company.\n\nAt the time of its collapse, Hin Leong owed $3.85bn. HSBC had the biggest exposure at $600mn, followed by ABN Amro at $300mn, while French lender Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale had lent the company $240mn. Singaporean banks \u2014 DBS Group, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank \u2014 had exposures worth $680mn.\n\nHSBC also lent $49mn to ZenRock, but reported the collapsed trader to Singaporean police over what it described as \u201cdishonest practices\u201d.\n\nAgritrade was found to have been granted $1.5bn of credit from 26 lenders. Its creditors accused the business of fraud through issuing duplicate bills of lading \u2014 the legal documents issued by transportation companies to shippers \u2014 to multiple banks as security against loans.\n\n\u201cProsecutors are taking a more proactive approach,\u201d said Kit Smith, a UK-based lawyer specialising in global fraud and trade disputes at Keidan Harrison. \u201cThere is a push to be more stringent on big-ticket frauds and make examples of the perpetrators.\u201d\n\nEnterprise Singapore, the government agency charged with promoting business, said there was \u201czero tolerance for fraudulent activities in Singapore\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe fraud cases seen in the commodities trading sector in the past have been attributed to weak disclosure practices and internal controls among a minority of the trading companies,\u201d it said in a statement to the Financial Times.\n\n\u201cWhen Singapore authorities discover financial fraud in the trading sector, we will take immediate action to bring perpetrators to task as seen in the case of Hin Leong.\u201d\n\nThe government has also launched a series of initiatives in recent years aimed at impeding fraudsters\u2019 ability to rip-off creditors.\n\nAmong them is a trade finance registry to prevent the same asset being pledged as a security for more than one loan to different institutions. The government has also tried to encourage traders to move away from paper documentation, instead exchanging digital records on a public blockchain to reduce forgeries.\n\nWhile Lambert said Singapore was \u201craising the stakes in terms of compliance and regulatory requirements\u201d, he added that regulators should have been firmer in previous accounting scandals.\n\nThe scandals have also forced banks to take a much more stringent approach to lending to commodity traders. Several lenders announced they were pulling out of the market in 2020.\n\n\u201cBanks are approaching their customers with a great deal more vigilance now, which is a good thing, but it has meant smaller traders are finding it harder to attract financing,\u201d said Bhinder.\n\n\u201cLim\u2019s sentencing closes a chapter for Singapore and the commodities trading market \u2014 it has been a learning experience for everyone.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b10c85a9-98e9-4b5e-9e5a-db044044f6f3"}, {"uuid4": "6551f75f-19d9-49e7-b8c5-a5de2018350e", "title": "Singapore oil trader sentenced to 17 years for \u2018cheating\u2019 HSBC over $112mn", "description": "Octogenarian Lim Oon Kuin handed long jail term as \u2018deterrent\u2019 in city-state\u2019s fight against commodity trading corruption ", "author": "Owen Walker", "published_date": "2024-11-18T09:56:13.852Z", "content": "An octogenarian oil trader has been given a 17-and-a-half-year jail sentence in Singapore for defrauding HSBC, in a long-running case that sent shockwaves through the city-state\u2019s commodity trading sector.\n\nLim Oon Kuin, known as OK Lim and once one of Singapore\u2019s richest men, was sentenced on Monday after being convicted in May of \u201ccheating\u201d HSBC and abetting forgery. The 82-year-old founder of Hin Leong Trading was accused of encouraging a company executive to forge documents that tricked the bank into disbursing nearly $112mn.\n\nJudge Toh Han Li of Singapore\u2019s State Courts said the length of Lim\u2019s sentence was designed to act as a \u201cdeterrent\u201d. Prosecutors had sought a jail term of up to 20 years; Lim\u2019s defence lawyer Davinder Singh argued for seven years, given his age and poor health. Lim attended court hearings in a wheelchair.\n\nBloomberg reported that Singh had appealed on behalf of his client and Lim would not begin his sentence until after the appeal hearing.\n\nThe case had centred on allegations that Hin Leong had been hiding losses from trading in futures markets and selling off oil inventories already pledged as collateral for loans.\n\nLim was originally charged in 2020 after confessing to hiding $800mn in losses from creditors \u2014 including HSBC and Singapore\u2019s biggest lender DBS \u2014 and directing the company\u2019s finance department not to disclose the losses.\n\nHe was initially hit with 130 criminal charges involving hundreds of millions of dollars, but was eventually tried on just three.\n\nSingapore\u2019s pivotal position on global shipping lanes connecting China with global markets, as well as its stability and low corporate tax rates, have made it one of the most important global hubs for commodities trading.\n\nBut a spate of scandals in the market throughout the 2010s raised questions about Singapore\u2019s ability to rein in its trading houses. Several cases centred around fraud and forged documents. Paper trails make up the backbone of the industry.\n\nWith a single delivery truck, Lim founded Hin Leong in 1963 as an oil distributor. Over the decades, the family business grew to become Singapore\u2019s largest independent oil trader and a major supplier of shipping fuel.\n\nBut the collapse in the oil market in 2020 sent his empire into a tailspin.

I am writing this week\u2019s newsletter from Bangkok, where I am attending an annual meeting with colleagues from across the region.\n\nI was posted here as an editor about a decade ago, and it\u2019s always a pleasure to come back, but the positioning of Thailand \u2014 and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as a whole \u2014 has shifted significantly, especially since tensions between the US and China started to heat up around 2018.\n\nGetting caught between great power rivals like this is something smaller nations seek to avoid, and members of Asean are no exception. But even when countries do get drawn into these power plays, it is not always in a negative way, such as Vietnam attracting substantial investments and emerging as a major manufacturing hub of various tech products during this period.\n\nAs we feature in this edition of the newsletter, Singapore has enjoyed a sharp rise up the global ranking of start-up ecosystems, as investment in so-called deep tech surged against a backdrop of Sino-American tensions. Cambodia, meanwhile, is becoming a battleground between China and Japan, a key US ally, in terms of telecom infrastructure building, which could turn into a positive for local users as increased competition brings better services at lower prices.\n\nOf course, anyone can find themselves in the crossfire of the US-China rivalry, as our Taipei colleagues remind us with their scoop this week about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) halting shipments to certain customers to avoid inadvertently violating US export controls on China.\n\nNo matter who is elected president in the US next week \u2014 Kamala Harris or Donald Trump \u2014 other countries will continue having to navigate the Washington-Beijing rivalry with all its various consequences.\n\nTSMC, the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, has stopped shipping to at least two chip developers\u00a0over suspicions they were trying to circumvent US export controls on China\u2019s Huawei Technologies, Nikkei Asia\u2019s tech correspondents Cheng Ting-Fang\u00a0and Lauly Li\u00a0reported in this exclusive story from Taipei.\n\nThe two developers placed orders for chips made with 7-nanometre process technology, which TSMC has been using for mass production since 2018. Washington has been restricting chipmaking equipment containing American technology from being used to make chips of 14nm or better for China without an export license. TSMC\u2019s most advanced commercial products are the 3-nm processor chips used for Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 series.\n\nEnforcing Washington\u2019s export controls is far from straightforward, as chip developers could use layers of non-Chinese shell companies to camouflage their orders, according to sources.\n\nTSMC reiterated to Nikkei Asia that it has not supplied Huawei since mid-September 2020 in compliance with the US export restrictions.\n\nSamsung Electronics is struggling to hold on to its crown as the world\u2019s top-selling smartphone maker, write the Financial Times\u2019 Song Jung-a\u00a0and Christian Davies.\n\nThe South Korean tech giant was the only one of the top five global smartphone makers to experience falling shipments\u00a0in the third quarter of this year, losing market share to US rival Apple and Chinese contenders offering slick new foldable devices.\n\nResearch group TechInsights expects Apple\u2019s new generative artificial intelligence features to help power the US company past Samsung next year.\n\nSamsung once pioneered foldable devices but ceded the top spot earlier this year to Chinese rival Huawei, which had a 27.5 per cent share of the foldables market in the second quarter, compared with Samsung\u2019s 16.4 per cent, according to IDC.\n\nThe company\u2019s smartphone struggles come at a critical point. It has been hit by a series of failures at its semiconductor division, which accounts for 60 per cent of Samsung\u2019s operating profit.\n\n\u201cDeep tech\u201d endeavours in Singapore are getting a boost\u00a0amid the ever-intensifying Sino-American tech tensions. Nikkei Asia\u2019s Tsubasa Suruga\u00a0reports that investment in this field \u2014 which is based on scientific research with potentially large social impacts like chips, robotics and medicine \u2014 was up 31 per cent by volume last year, even as overall start-up investment dropped 20 per cent.\n\nBased on data by DealStreetAsia and Enterprise Singapore, deep tech accounted for 25 per cent of the total deal value, up from 17 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe boost in deep tech investment helped push the city-state\u2019s global start-up ecosystem ranking to seventh this year, up from 18th just two years ago, and leapfrogging all other Asian hubs, including Beijing, Seoul and Tokyo, according to US-based research company Startup Genome.\n\nInvestors \u2014 who are mostly local or American, but also from Taiwan, Japan, France and Malaysia \u2014 say deep tech tends to remain under the radar due to the complex technology and expertise involved, but it is gaining importance amid the US-China trade war and supply chain shifts.\n\nA Japanese tech consortium, with help from government subsidies, is challenging the Chinese dominance in the 5G market. The initial battleground is Cambodia, an ostensibly neutral country that has shown itself to be a staunch ally to Beijing, according to an exclusive report by Nikkei\u2019s Kiu Sugano, Shiho Miyajima\u00a0and Kyoko Hariya.\n\nOrex Sai, a joint venture between NTT DoCoMo and NEC, will build a 4G network at a large commercial complex in the south-east Asian country by March, which will serve as a platform for transitioning to 5G in the future.\n\nCambodia\u2019s telecom network, like many around the world, is reliant on equipment from Huawei Technologies. The Chinese company and its compatriot ZTE together control more than 40 per cent of the global market for 5G base stations, British research company Omdia says. Japanese players as a whole hold about 3 per cent.\n\nFor this Cambodia project, Tokyo is applying a new aid policy that applies government assistance proactively rather than waiting for a request from a recipient country. The development co-operation charter revised last year, which stresses Japanese aid money \u201cdoes not involve debt traps or economic coercion, and that does not undermine the independence and sustainability of developing countries\u201d, will also be applied to the project.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fb80b67d-87b6-4aec-af1f-e656d71afd28"}, {"uuid4": "b111962c-32a7-440a-903a-f5932c894f84", "title": "Addison Lee to be bought by Singapore-listed group in \u00a3269mn deal", "description": "UK private-hire taxi company is due to undergo its third change of ownership in just over a decade ", "author": "Maxine Kelly", "published_date": "2024-10-23T20:23:51.117Z", "content": "Addison Lee, the UK-based private-hire taxi and courier company, has agreed to be bought by Singapore-listed transport conglomerate ComfortDelGro in a\u00a0deal valuing the business\u00a0at \u00a3269.1mn.\n\nComfortDelGro, a multinational company with operations ranging from taxis to rail and London buses, is buying Addison Lee from a consortium led by chief executive Liam Griffin and Cheyne Capital.\n\nOn Wednesday ComfortDelGro said the acquisition, to be done through its UK subsidiary CityFleet Networks, would enable it to expand into the \u201cpremium mobility segment\u201d and help its shift towards clean energy vehicles.\n\nThe combined group\u2019s taxi and private hire network will consist of more than 34,000 vehicles globally upon completion of the deal.\n\nThe transaction marks the third change of ownership in just over a decade for Addison Lee, as the London taxi market has been disrupted by ride-hailing apps such as Uber, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nPrivate equity group Carlyle bought the business from the Griffin family, Addison Lee\u2019s founders, for \u00a3300mn in 2013.

During his lifetime, Lee Kuan Yew had repeatedly stated that once his children had moved out of the family home, the property should be demolished to avoid it becoming a shrine to himself. Lee Hsien Yang wanted his wishes enforced, but other family members disagreed.\n\nIn response to inquiries over the asylum move this week, the Singapore authorities released a 5,000-word statement, repeating claims that Lee Suet Fern had tampered with the final draft of Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s will in order to reinstate a \u201cdemolition clause\u201d regarding 38 Oxley Road and also carve out a larger portion of the estate for her husband.\n\nLee Wei Ling, an accomplished doctor who established the National Neuroscience Institute in the former British colony, diagnosed herself with progressive supranuclear palsy in 2020.\n\nHer death was announced by Lee Hsien Yang on Facebook, with her younger brother immediately calling afresh for the demolition of 38 Oxley Road.\n\nLee Hsien Loong, who stepped aside as prime minister earlier this year but who remains a senior minister, responded on Facebook, saying: \u201cI held nothing against Ling, and continued to do whatever I could to ensure her welfare,\u201d adding that she was \u201cfiercely loyal to friends, sympathised instinctively with the underdog, and would mobilise actively to do something when she saw unfairness, or suspected wrongdoing\u201d.\n\nIn seeking political asylum in Britain, Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern are understood to have successfully argued that their brother Lee Hsien Loong has used the organs of state against their wing of the family to block any chance that their son, Li Shengwu, might enter politics in Singapore and one day rise to the position of prime minister.\n\nLi Shengwu, an economist who has adopted a different English spelling of the family name, was recently granted tenure at Harvard University, where he is a professor. He has denied having any interest in pursuing a political career, but nevertheless considers himself to be exiled from the city-state.\n\nSingapore\u2019s legal system, particularly its libel laws frequently used by Lee Kuan Yew and his successors, has long made life difficult for the political opponents of the Singapore government and for the media.\n\nIn its statement, the Singapore government insisted Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern, along with their son, \u201care and have always been free to return to Singapore\u201d, adding that the city state\u2019s judiciary is impartial and makes decisions independently.\n\nIt added: \u201cAs the government has stated on many occasions, in parliament and elsewhere, senior minister Lee Hsien Loong has long recused himself on all matters relating to 38 Oxley Road,\u201d adding that while Lee Kuan Yew \u201cpreferred demolition, he was also willing to consider other options such as refurbishing and redesigning the interior\u201d.\n\nPosting on Facebook, Lee Hsien Yang said: \u201cIn 2017, my sister Wei Ling and I declared, \u2018We do not trust Hsien Loong as a brother or as a leader.\u2019 We stated that we feared the abuse of the organs of the Singapore state against us and against my family. Because of that risk, I was unable to attend Wei Ling\u2019s funeral.\u201d\n\nHe said the Singapore government\u2019s attacks against him were a matter of public record. \u201cOn the basis of these facts, the UK has determined that I face a well-founded risk of persecution, and cannot safely return to Singapore.\u201d\n\nWhile the figures are low compared with more troubled parts of the world, data from the UN refugee agency UNHCR shows a marked rise in the number of Singapore nationals seeking asylum elsewhere, a trend that Singapore\u2019s critics put down to the authoritarian nature of the city-state\u2019s government.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8a3562c9-0f8f-4451-b190-a52b487d25e3"}, {"uuid4": "950cbb8a-f4c7-483f-bc6b-95d3cf25c8e6", "title": "Which luxury train crew are you?", "description": "From the Venice Simplon-Orient\u2011Express to The Ghan Expedition, it\u2019s never been easier, or chicer, to travel by rail.

Excursions include bushwalks, visits to Indigenous art\u00a0galleries and alfresco lantern-lit dinners; an extra spend gets you helicopter tours and a private visit to Uluru.\n\nStraightforward, modern Australian, including excellent wines, craft beers and spirits, though Platinum travellers have the Bollinger on free-flow. They also have their own restaurant car, whose chefs privilege local-to-the-route providores. But the charm seems concentrated in the Queen Adelaide restaurant, where ricotta hotcakes \u00e0 la Granger & Co are a breakfast highlight. Everything, down to that last\u00a0midnight glass of Seppeltsfield Para\u00a0Tawny, is included in the price.\n\nThe Orient Express this is not: nice trousers and linen shirts will see you through supper. Far more important is having your bush- whacking best \u2014 the right shoes, layers, hats and sunscreen \u2014 for the vagaries of light and temperature on the excursions. Basically you can\u2019t go wrong with breathe-tech Slowear and an old pair of Blundies.\n\nThis opulent Belmond overnighter \u2014 which used to connect Singapore and Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur and Penang \u2014\u00a0was relaunched at the start of 2024. The\u00a0refurbished cars gleam with tropical-hardwood marquetry, brass details, gold-threaded passementerie and a diffuse Victorian-splendour ambience. There\u2019s an observation car, with walls of windows and simple settee seating, and a bar with a\u00a0rotating host of crooners and the odd roving magician. A very Belmond bonus: the onboard Dior Spa (a carriage with two treatment rooms).\n\nBelmond has teased that Bangkok will be back on the agenda by next year; meanwhile, the E&OE traces two itineraries in and out of\u00a0Singapore. \u201cWild Malaysia\u201d takes you variously hiking, e-biking, caving and tiger-spotting (if you\u2019re lucky) in Merapoh and Taman Negara National Park. \u201cEssence of Malaysia\u201d is about street-food tasting, art tours of George Town (the bustling ex-colonial capital of Penang), and speed-boating off\u00a0the beaches of Langkawi.\n\nSome of us think the most exciting aspect of the E&OE reboot is resident chef Andr\u00e9 Chiang, whose eponymous restaurant in Singapore racked up multiple Michelin stars and best-in-Asia accolades before closing in 2018. Onboard, he marries and reinterprets French and south-east Asian traditions: think steaming bowls of laksa bouillabaisse and spicy cacao ganache.\n\nJungle-trekking and sea spray by day don\u2019t preclude de rigueur evening gloss. Along with The Organic Pharmacy\u2019s bug repellent, sturdy-soled walkers and loose cotton-linen (with full-length sleeves), bring a couple of Dodo Bar Or or Anine Bing silk slip dresses. For him, chinos and a travel jacket from Connolly or De Bonne Facture.\n\nPowered by a venture between hospitality behemoth Accor (owner of the Orient Express brand name), luxury property fund\u00a0Arsenale and three Italian train companies, La Dolce Vita aims to give the\u00a0VSOE a run for its Italy money by making the journey as much about the destinations and way-stops as the trains themselves. Not that those will be anything to sneeze at, designed by Milanese darlings Dimore Studio with mirrored walls, groovy \u201960s- and \u201970s-inspired textiles and scads of Gio Ponti, Osvaldo Borsani and Gae Aulenti-inspired flourishes everywhere.\n\nThe premium is on place, connecting destinations previously unserviced by luxury sleeper train, from Montalcino in southern Tuscany to Maratea and Matera in Basilicata, Monferrato in Piedmont (for truffles and Nebbiolo), and even Sicily. The excursions will include tastings, private palazzi, world heritage sites and aperitivi in five-star partner hotels,\u00a0such as Maratea\u2019s lovely Santavenere, along the way.\n\nA waves-making name was needed, and they sure tapped one: Heinz Beck, the thrice Michelin-starred founder of the Order of The Knights of Italian Cuisine, whose La Pergola in Rome remains one of\u00a0Italy\u2019s premier gourmet destinations. La\u00a0Dolce Vita has also partnered with Vinitaly to have exclusive access to award-winning vintages, representing northern, central and southern Italy and personally selected by Beck, on the carte.\n\nHigh Italian glamour: from floor-length La\u00a0DoubleJ printed frocks to wide-lapelled jackets from Giuliva Heritage or\u00a0Cifonelli. Plus Capri sandals and navy and black velvet furlane for both sexes. Launches spring 2025\n\nSince its launch in 2010 (first covered in\u00a0HTSI\u2019s pages), the Maharajas\u2019 has been\u00a0touted as the closest thing there is to\u00a0a\u00a0palace on wheels, from the dedicated butler-per-client ratio to the generous size of the suites, with their separate lounging and sleeping quarters (and, in some cases, full-sized tubs in the bathrooms); its 23\u00a0carriages measure almost half a\u00a0mile. Red carpets, fuchsia silk canopies and musicians and dancers greet guests at arrival stations. There are\u00a0two restaurants, a\u00a0bar and games lounge, and even a\u00a0boutique. Palette- and materials-wise, more is more is always more, with just a\u00a0bit extra for good measure.\n\nThe various three- to six-night itineraries are multi-state journeys that connect all-star destinations in northern and central India; the train trundles along old\u00a0state-railway lines by night, calling in\u00a0by day at Mehrangarh Fort, Orchha, Ranthambore (whence India\u2019s most famous tiger safaris), the Taj Mahal or\u00a0the\u00a0temples at Khajuraho. Caravans and the occasional vintage limousine ferry\u00a0guests to and from sites, or to cocktails and dinner at heritage palace hotels along the route.\n\nGenerally good, if with less wow factor than on comparable trains elsewhere (perhaps it\u2019s time for state owners IRCTC to consider luring a Garima Arora or Gaggan Anand aboard?). Traditional Indian \u2014 including a daily regional thali and rustic Mewari dishes \u2014 alternates with\u00a0standard continental and international fare; both restaurants, Mayur Mahal and Rang Mahal, cater to carnivores and vegetarians.\n\nYour best kani weave pashmina from Kashmir Loom or Andraab \u2014 good for elegant onboard suppers and for\u00a0covering shoulders at holy sites both\u00a0Hindu and Muslim.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7fbce623-8283-4e78-8dea-1aba498b62d0"}, {"uuid4": "ebe1a6b8-03d7-448e-a246-d5fa31bfb3fe", "title": "Switzerland\u2019s wealth managers bank on a future in Asia", "description": "Hong Kong and Singapore are the world\u2019s rising wealth centres", "author": "Chan Ho-him", "published_date": "2024-10-16T03:00:39.576Z", "content": "The rich have always been welcomed in Switzerland. To spend, but more importantly to hoard. Across the country, in secretive locations, banks operate underground vaults and storage facilities \u2014 often converted military bunkers that have been hewn from mountain rock. Some have no roads nearby and can only be accessed by air.\n\nAt one facility 40km south of Lucerne, storage company Br\u00fcnig Mega Safe is carving into an imposing mountain and plans to offer \u201cprofessional and secure storage of assets in underground caverns\u201d for anything from gold bars and stock certificates to artworks and classic cars. Prices start at $500,000 for a 25 sqm vault.\n\nFor three centuries, the country has also offered the rich reliable, specialist advice on managing and investing their money. In times of war, political turmoil and rising taxes, the country\u2019s stability and geopolitical neutrality \u2014 combined with its strict adherence to banking discretion \u2014 supported a thriving and world-leading wealth management industry.\n\nBut, in recent years, those foundations have begun to crack \u2014 and its rivals in Asia are looking on. Under international pressure, Switzerland has been chipping away at its banking secrecy laws that restrict banks from passing on details about their clients to governments. And the country\u2019s decision to sanction Russian oligarchs following Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago has dented its reputation for international neutrality.\n\nMeanwhile, the collapse last year of Credit Suisse \u2014 the country\u2019s second-biggest bank, trusted by millions of wealthy clients globally \u2014 has cast a shadow over Switzerland\u2019s claim to be a stable nation with a sturdy financial services sector. The remainder of the Swiss banking sector is aware of what this means. \u201cSingapore and Hong Kong are going to be more and more important competitors to Switzerland as global hubs,\u201d says Giorgio Pradelli, chief executive of Swiss private bank EFG, which operates in all three countries and is increasingly focused on Asia.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is set to overtake Switzerland as the world\u2019s biggest offshore wealth hub by 2028, with Singapore not far behind. Hong Kong would then account for $3.2tn out of the total $17.1tn in global offshore wealth assets, compared with $3.1tn for Switzerland and $2.5tn for Singapore, according to Boston Consulting Group estimates.\n\nIn the five years to 2028, Hong Kong\u2019s cross-border wealth market is on track to grow by 6 per cent a year in terms of assets, compared with 3.6 per cent in Switzerland and 8.5 per cent in Singapore.\n\n\u201cSwitzerland will always be our competitor, but we are not afraid,\u201d says Jason Fong, a 27-year banking and asset management veteran who has been tasked by the Hong Kong government with attracting family offices to the Chinese territory. \u201cThey are crumbling and we are in a very advantageous situation.\u201d\n\nMuch has changed since the early 18th century, when France\u2019s Catholic kings tapped the banks of Geneva for funds, but tried to conceal their dealings with the city\u2019s Huguenot financiers, fearing a sectarian backlash at home. An edict from the Great Council of Geneva in 1713 prohibited bankers from sharing client registers with the authorities.\n\nGeneva\u2019s commitment to banking discretion helped elevate it into a European financial powerhouse and drew in Swiss mercenary soldiers who were looking to safeguard their money made from fighting abroad. \u201cThe Swiss laid the foundation for today\u2019s global wealth management model,\u201d says Iqbal Khan, co-head of wealth management at UBS. \u201cIts heritage comes from the duty of care for others\u2019 property and the principle of self-control.\u201d\n\nSecrecy became enshrined in Swiss legislation with a 1934 banking law, which set out that bankers who disclosed client information could be jailed. Initially, European Jews fleeing persecution set up Swiss bank accounts to protect their valuables, but later such accounts were favoured by Nazis to store their looted wealth. A Swiss bank account soon became the financial product of choice for the rich who did not want too much attention on their fortunes\u2019 sources.\n\nThis commitment to clandestine banking attracted despots and oligarchs throughout the 20th century, while tax-evading lawyers and country doctors from neighbouring European countries made up a large proportion of Swiss private banks\u2019 clients. It was in the middle of the 20th century that Swiss bankers attracted the nickname of the \u201cgnomes of Zurich\u201d from British politicians for their ability to hoard heaps of gold in underground vaults. It was soon regarded as a badge of honour. Swiss bankers took to answering calls from British colleagues by saying: \u201cHello, gnome speaking.\u201d\n\nMore recently, though, under pressure from tax authorities around the world following a series of high-profile scandals over the flows of illicit money, Switzerland has acquiesced to demands for greater transparency around its banking sector.\n\nIn 2017, it signed up to the international automatic exchange of information standard, which requires Swiss financial institutions to share details on their clients with the countries where they are tax resident. More than 100 countries are signed up to the same standard, which has all but killed off Switzerland\u2019s allure for tax evaders.\n\nThe final blow for Swiss banking discretion came two years ago with the Suisse Secrets scandal, where documents detailing the accounts of 30,000 Credit Suisse clients were leaked to a consortium of international media outlets. Among those named in the cache of documents \u2014 which dated back to the 1940s \u2014 were war criminals, autocrats, oligarchs, drug smugglers and human traffickers.\n\nThe collapse of Credit Suisse prompted the Swiss government to devise a series of proposals to bolster the banking system, including giving more power to the domestic financial regulator and potentially increasing UBS\u2019s capital requirements. Executives in Zurich fear that if the new measures are too draconian, they could ultimately put their banks at a disadvantage to their foreign rivals.\n\n\u201cFinancial centres like Hong Kong, Singapore and the US are aggressively competing, and making great progress, for the offshore wealth management crown that Switzerland holds today,\u201d UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti said in June. \u201cForeign financial centres would benefit if Switzerland were to restrict its ability to maintain a leading presence abroad.\u201d\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s reputation for neutrality on the world stage has proved enticing over the decades for the global and mobile rich, especially in times of rising geopolitical tension. Yet this, too, is being tested. The decision by Switzerland following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine to sign up to the US and EU sanctions regimes has led to questions from clients about whether the country is still an impartial player.\n\nA recent report from the Swiss Bankers Association lobby group identified Switzerland\u2019s adherence to international sanctions regimes as the top geopolitical risk facing the country\u2019s wealth managers. The immediate effect of implementing sanctions was Swiss banks pulling out of Russia and jettisoning Russian clients, many of whom switched their offshore bank accounts to the Middle East.\n\nJimmy Lee, head of Asia-Pacific at Julius Baer, has run several western banks\u2019 Singapore and Hong Kong operations over the past three decades. He says he is often asked by clients whether Switzerland is still neutral. \u201cWe explain to them that Ukraine is at the doorstep of Switzerland and they are taking a stance,\u201d he says. \u201cIf your neighbour\u2019s house is on fire, you cannot stay neutral.\u201d\n\nThe Ukraine war has brought Switzerland closer to Nato, with a recent paper commissioned by the country\u2019s defence ministry suggesting Swiss troops could co-operate in military manoeuvres with other states for the first time since 1515.\n\nAs Switzerland grapples with its five-century-old commitment to neutrality, rival wealth management hubs have sought to project their own credentials as non-partisan places to do business. \u201cSome of these Asian wealth hubs played their hand extremely well,\u201d says a Swiss bank executive. \u201cThey managed to position themselves as neutral, although they all adopted the US sanctions just like we did.\u201d\n\nThe story of how Asia\u2019s two main financial entrep\u00f4ts copied the Swiss white-glove model of wealth management and ended up outpacing their European rival could be seen as a historical quirk \u2014 a byproduct of the supercharged growth in Asian wealth in the 21st century. But, in Singapore\u2019s case, it was more by design. It was on a trip to Zurich in 1967, two years after Singapore\u2019s independence from Malaysia, that Lee Kuan Yew set upon the idea of transforming the nation he had founded into Asia\u2019s financial hub. Lee, the country\u2019s first prime minister, had seen the way Switzerland, a small country with few natural resources and surrounded by powerful neighbours, had established itself over several centuries as the global centre of offshore banking and wealth management.\n\nSingapore\u2019s government followed Switzerland\u2019s lead in designing its tax system to attract rich foreigners looking for a base to park their wealth, while also encouraging Swiss private banks to set up shop. \u201cWe have\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009deliberately encouraged the development of Singapore as a financial centre,\u201d Lee said on a subsequent trip to Zurich in 1971 while speaking at a reception at the Union Bank of Switzerland. \u201cSingapore sets out to be to south-east Asia what Switzerland is to Europe \u2014 a money and gold market.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason for the rise of Hong Kong and Singapore as offshore wealth hubs is down to demographics and how quickly a wealthy upper class has emerged in Asia in recent decades. Mainland China is now home to 6mn millionaires, the second-highest number behind the US. This weight of money funnelling into Hong Kong from mainland China, which accounts for just under half of the cross-border money flowing into Hong Kong\u2019s wealth managers, according to McKinsey, has driven its rapid growth \u2014 even as that of Switzerland and Singapore, to a lesser extent, has slowed.\n\nThis proximity is one of the main reasons UBS recently announced it would move its local headquarters to a tower sitting on top of the West Kowloon train terminus. The new development is designed to connect Hong Kong by high-speed rail to the surrounding Greater Bay Area, the largest and most populated urban area in the world.\n\nBy contrast, Singapore acts more like an entry point for global investors into south-east, and increasingly, north Asia. China is expected to account for about 30 per cent of wealth inflows into the city state over the next five years, with Hong Kong and Taiwan the next biggest markets.\n\nA sign of Hong Kong and Singapore\u2019s growing importance as offshore wealth hubs is the booming market for family offices. These small, private companies are set up to manage the wealth of one or maybe a handful of wealthy families, providing a full suite of services, from tax and succession planning to investing and philanthropy. Both Hong Kong and Singapore are on course to report record numbers of launches this year. There were 50 family offices operating in Singapore in 2018, but that has ballooned to 1,650 today. Hong Kong, meanwhile, has more than 2,700.\n\nThe new launches are typically serving families in other Asian countries looking to diversify where their wealth is managed, transferring a large chunk from their domestic market to meet their global interests or give them options if things get uncomfortable at home. Singapore, in particular, is attracting family office branches from further afield. \u201cSome are coming from the Middle East and Europe,\u201d says Jin Yee Young, co-head of Asia-Pacific wealth management at UBS, who runs the Singapore business. \u201cThey see Singapore as a window to the region. They are very established, some are even multigenerational family offices, and they are looking to tap into investments in the region.\u201d\n\nWhen Hong Kong and Singapore were starting to establish their wealth management sectors, they looked to the Swiss model for inspiration. Yet for a long time, the clients had vastly different needs. \u201cWhen I started in private banking in the 1990s, it was about the private individual and their needs,\u201d says Amy Lo, the other co-head of UBS\u2019s Apac wealth business, who runs the Hong Kong operation. \u201cAs things have globalised, 70 per cent of our clients are entrepreneurs and now it is much more about succession planning, looking after their businesses, philanthropy and doing good for society.\u201d\n\nThe authorities in Singapore and Hong Kong are working on ways to improve the local talent pools to ensure they can meet evolving client needs. \u201cWhenever I go to the Asian international financial centres, the general discussion is always on how to increase the number of people who are interested in working in wealth management,\u201d says Pradelli of EFG. \u201cTalent is very important. While we traditionally have a strong talent base for our industry in Switzerland, the pipeline of talent in Asian financial centres is strong and improving, but still quite scarce.\u201d\n\nSingapore has had an influx of money from China and Hong Kong in recent years, as rich individuals moved their wealth from what they regard as an increasingly authoritarian Chinese state. But those inflows culminated in a S$3bn ($2.34bn) scandal last year, in which 10 Chinese nationals were convicted of money laundering following Singapore\u2019s biggest investigation into online gambling in Asia. It involved island-wide raids and the seizure of gold bars, expensive wines, crypto assets, designer handbags and luxury cars. Banks in Singapore have responded by heightening scrutiny of foreign customers and intensifying efforts to identify sources of wealth, leading to delays in onboarding new customers.\n\nWhile some critics have suggested the episode highlighted lax controls in Singapore\u2019s burgeoning family office sector, Marco Pagliara, head of emerging markets at Deutsche Bank\u2019s private bank, attributes it more to growing pains that the local regulator responded to.\n\n\u201cThere was a phase where there was a significant flow coming from north Asia \u2014 on the back of that there was correction that needed to be implemented. They did it quite swiftly,\u201d says Pagliara. \u201cSingapore is focused on running a very tight and organised ship with the way they manage their financial centre.\u201d\n\nThis month, the Singaporean government published a package of recommendations to tighten anti-money-laundering rules in the city state, including improving information sharing between departments and giving prosecutors stronger powers. \u201cWe continually engage the industry and stakeholders to ensure that our framework remains robust against illegitimate wealth and welcoming of legitimate businesses and investors,\u201d said the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country\u2019s financial regulator.\n\nThough their home market has been losing ground, Switzerland\u2019s wealth managers are seeking to capitalise on the growth in Asia by building on the cachet associated with being a Swiss bank. \u201cSwissness stands for high quality, trust and credibility,\u201d says UBS\u2019s Khan, who recently relocated to Hong Kong to run the bank\u2019s Asia-Pacific business. \u201cBut that\u2019s not enough in today\u2019s world. You need to have cultural heritage as well.\u201d\n\nKhan, who will split his time between Hong Kong and Singapore, had previously been the sole head of UBS\u2019s wealth management business and was based in Zurich. But he is one of several senior executives at European wealth managers who have relocated to Asia as they target the region for growth. Asia\u2019s biggest banks were mostly late to prioritise developing their own wealth management businesses and trail far behind their longer established competitors from Europe and the US. But they are starting to catch up.\n\nThe Swiss banks have recognised that although their country\u2019s reputation as the world\u2019s centre for wealth management has taken a hit in recent years, they can still dominate in rival financial hubs.\n\nThis article is part of FT Wealth, a section providing in-depth coverage of philanthropy, entrepreneurs, family offices, as well as alternative and impact investment", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b5b980fc-de63-4e07-8dd5-9a8385baec4a"}, {"uuid4": "d315d351-47c6-4139-9bd6-ee5fb7715959", "title": "Singapore charges billionaire in gifts scandal involving ex-transport minister", "description": "Ong Beng Seng accused of abetting S Iswaran who was sentenced to a year in prison this week", "author": "A.

Ong did not enter a plea, local media reported.\n\nThe indictment against Ong comes one day after Iswaran was sentenced to a one-year jail term for accepting gifts valued at more than $300,000 and obstructing justice. He became the first Singaporean minister to be imprisoned in nearly 50 years.\n\nIswaran was accused of accepting gifts from Ong, who owns the rights to the Singapore Grand Prix, at a time when he had official dealings with the tycoon. As transport minister, Iswaran was the most senior government official negotiating with Ong\u2019s company on matters related to the Formula One race in Singapore.\n\nIswaran pleaded guilty last month to five charges, including four counts of obtaining valuable items and one of obstruction of justice. He resigned as transport minister earlier this year after he was formally charged.\n\nThe charges against Ong correspond to two of the charges to which Iswaran pleaded guilty, the AGC said.\n\nIswaran had initially faced 35 charges, though prosecutors proceeded with only five at the start of the trial. Most of the charges related to gifts from Ong, including tickets to English Premier League football matches, the Singapore F1 race, and plays including Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Hamilton and Kinky Boots as well as a business-class flight from Doha to Singapore in 2022.\n\nOng, a Malaysian citizen, was first arrested in July 2023 and released on bail. He is the majority owner of Singapore GP Pte, the promoter for the F1 race in Singapore. He is also the founder of Hotel Properties, which has brands including the Four Seasons and InterContinental in its property portfolio.\n\nThe Ong family also has a majority stake in the British luxury handbag maker Mulberry.\n\nIswaran was also charged with receiving gifts, including whisky and a Brompton T Line bicycle, from another businessman, Lum Kok Seng. Lum is the managing director of Lum Chang Holdings, a construction firm. He will not be charged, the AGC said on Friday.\n\nA lawyer for Ong declined to comment.\n\nThe scandal has come at a sensitive time for Singapore, which prides itself on its reputation for clean governance and transparency. Ministers in the Asian financial hub are among the highest paid in the world, earning about S$1mn (US$771,000) a year in part to discourage corruption.\n\nSingapore is set to hold elections next year, the first under new Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who took office in May. The ruling People\u2019s Action party \u2014 which has governed the city-state since independence in 1965 \u2014 is expected to win, but its reputation has taken a hit from a series of scandals, including the corruption allegations against Iswaran.\n\nIn a statement following Iswaran\u2019s sentencing this week, Wong said he and his team would uphold the highest standards of integrity. \u201cOur system ensures that our public officers are accountable, and no one is beyond scrutiny or above the law,\u201d he said.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c59028c7-9f2f-41c8-b525-d45adb7c5880"}, {"uuid4": "dca642a7-b0a2-44a2-b5a8-314a035d442b", "title": "How Singapore became a magnet for independent jewellers", "description": "A wealthy local clientele looking for one-off designs has boosted the sector, and now word is spreading internationally", "author": "Francesca Fearon", "published_date": "2024-10-04T03:00:32.713Z", "content": "In a quiet street opposite Singapore\u2019s Peranakan Museum, in a white art deco building, is the boutique of Singapore jeweller State Property. The business is owned by husband-and-wife team Afzal Imram, an industrial designer, and Central Saint Martins-trained jeweller Ruiyin Lin. They founded it as a local fine-jewellery brand, and it is one of the few with an international profile, thanks to expansion into North America.\n\nAcross town, in a high-rise block, is the very discreet showroom of Simone Jewels, which was established 18 years ago by Malaysian-born Simone Ng. In 2020, she became the first Singapore jeweller to be stocked in London department store Harrods and has retail clients in Paris and the US.\n\nShe is better known in Singapore and around the region, though, for her one-of-a-kind artistic high jewellery. Her colourful masterpieces are inspired by her love of history and architecture \u2014 currently the palaces of Istanbul \u2014 and, last year, she debuted a gender-neutral collection called Tattoo with symbol-shaped pendants and cocktail rings.\n\nAnd what they all show is that Singapore has no shortage of creativity or high-spending clients to support a local jewellery industry \u2014 even though the island state is not a big manufacturer, like Hong Kong or Bangkok.\n\n\u201cMost things in Asia are generally mass-produced and creating one-in-the-world pieces is one of the reasons why we started the brand,\u201d says Ng. \u201cIn Singapore, customers are well-versed and sophisticated in their jewellery purchases.\u201d\n\nThe island may be small, but there are different types of jewellery markets, Ng explains. \u201cSome like [their jewellery] simple, some like it large and luxurious, and others would only buy into luxury brands,\u201d she says.\n\nThe city is the major shopping destination for the region, with many international luxury brands in the malls lining Orchard Road. Ng estimates 45 per cent of clients for her artistic masterpieces and bespoke designs are from elsewhere in south-east Asia, while 50 per cent are Singaporean and 5 per cent are from the rest of the world.\n\nSelf-purchasing women are the core clientele for most of the city\u2019s jewellers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got quite a number of bankers, doctors, and we\u2019ve noticed recently more C-suite ladies and entrepreneur clients, [including] some from the cryptocurrency world,\u201d says State Property\u2019s Imram. The majority are Singaporean, but customers fly in from Indonesia and the Philippines, he adds. Local clients are quite brand-driven, so they start their collections with Cartier, Tiffany & Co and Bulgari, Imram says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve seen a growing acceptance of local, independent labels, like State Property,\u201d he notes.\n\nAs a brand that now has around a dozen retailers in North America alone, State Property has learnt to tailor its approach to diverse tastes. \u201cThe different lifestyles, spending habits, weather, even\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the different sizes of people, this makes us pay closer attention to the nuances of each of our clients across markets,\u201d Imram says. It allows the brand to break out of a narrow creative perspective and \u201chelps us design better\u201d, he adds.\n\nState Property\u2019s modern art deco aesthetic is inspired by the blueprints of historic gardens. It combines gold, emeralds, diamonds and black enamel for bangles, earrings, pendants, a three-finger-spanning ring, and \u2014 always \u2014 signet rings (a favourite with clients). The majority of its American clients have slightly different tastes to those in Singapore, however. \u201cOne thing we hear from everyone is how the quality of our products is top-notch, which is something I have to thank our discerning Singaporean clientele for,\u201d says Imram.\n\nThe relatively small society of an island state has given rise to a tradition for bespoke design, from restyling jade and family heirlooms to making something exclusive and unique. In Chinatown there is Madly (which has satellite boutiques in Munich and Dubai) where clients choose from colourful gemstones and commission bespoke designs, mostly rings.\n\nIn the gentrified Tiong Bahru enclave is Calla Lily. Founded five years ago by Emily Tan, who previously worked with Jimmy Choo and Marni before graduating from the Gemological Institute of America, it creates vibrant, contemporary bespoke jewels. \u201cBespoke has always been a natural inclination for me as it allows me to explore different looks and styles,\u201d Tan says of designs that are inspired by the personalities and dreams of her clients.\n\n\u201cThe local market highly values one-of-a-kind pieces, giving us a competitive edge, and the rarity of certain gemstones also makes large-scale production difficult.\u201d\n\nBudgets vary wildly, she says, \u201cfrom S$2,000 to S$5,000 [$1,500-$3,000], but they can go up to S$100,000 and more, depending on the gemstones we source\u201d. Singaporean women feel very safe moving around the city wearing thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of jewellery, Tan notes, so they can enjoy their jewellery without having to wait for a special occasion \u2014 which \u201coften leads them to return for more unique designs\u201d.\n\nWhile Singapore attracts big luxury brands, it has also been a draw for independent jewellery designers. Two years ago, Nadine Ghosn relocated to Singapore, having lived between Paris and London. \u201cI wanted the experience of living in a new place that has great positive energy and [2022] was the time to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cI love Asia, the speed, the safety and the family vibes of Singapore.\u201d\n\nShe has found a ready market for her quirky jewels inspired by everyday items such as Lego, crayons and bicycle chains. \u201cI\u2019ve found locals and new Indonesian and Thai clients open to something different, colourful, fun and customised to their preferences,\u201d Ghosn says, citing her gold Pencil and Crayon bangles and rings, and the stackable Veggie Burger rings, as bestsellers. \u201cI think they appreciate the tongue-in-cheek and unexpectedness of my designs.\u201d Clients start with one piece and return for more. \u201cIt has definitely been my most rewarding move so far,\u201d she says.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/42a6bf1b-0326-44d3-aec0-ae3926a225b9"}, {"uuid4": "56f731ab-af99-4dcf-8bc2-5e1c79cb41f8", "title": "Former Singapore transport minister sentenced to year in jail over gifts", "description": "S Iswaran becomes city-state\u2019s first cabinet official to be imprisoned in nearly 50 years", "author": "A.

But as in many other markets new to active ETFs, asset managers were still \u201ctesting the waters\u201d to see if the products would gain traction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just in its infancy now, and firms are trying to figure out what\u2019s my entry point, how much do I have to invest to get in there, who am I selling to, and are we seeing success with the existing products that are out there,\u201d Koudelka said.\n\nThe Singapore Exchange gave the go-ahead for the listing of active ETFs last December, bringing the city-state into line with other jurisdictions in the region such as Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Indonesia and Japan.\n\nSingapore fund house Lion Global Investors subsequently launched the first such product in January in partnership with Japanese manager Nomura Asset Management, raising initial assets of S$37mn ($28.3mn). The Lion Global ETF has seen its assets inch up to S$49.2mn.\n\nSince then, however, there have been no further active ETF launches in the city-state, and no other products in the pipeline, the Monetary Authority of Singapore website shows.\n\nRival Asian funds hub Hong Kong has 28 active ETFs, with the first such product listing in June 2019, according to the Hong Kong stock exchange\u2019s website.\n\nChen Wang, Hong Kong-based deputy chief operating officer at CSOP Asset Management, said asset managers in Singapore were still studying regulatory requirements as well as gauging market appetite.\n\nCSOP AM has a presence across the Singapore and Hong Kong ETF markets, with five ETFs listed in the former and 40 ETFs in the latter. This includes three actively managed money market products in Hong Kong.\n\nOne critical challenge with investors in Singapore is their lack of familiarity with active ETFs.\n\n\u201cLocal investors in Singapore, they still need a lot more time to understand what\u2019s going on because the Singapore market is a relatively smaller market compared to the US or China or even Hong Kong, and investors tend to be relatively conservative in terms of their investment appetite,\u201d Wang said.\n\nThere was still \u201ca lot\u201d of investor education that was needed to show them the difference between active and passive, and then also the benefits of buying an active ETF versus investing in a mutual fund, she added.\n\nWang did not say whether CSOP AM had any active ETFs in the pipeline for Singapore.\n\nIf there was a \u201cclear interest in a certain type of ETF\u201d from investors, CSOP AM could \u201cmove very fast to launch\u201d, she noted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at new opportunities in the Singapore market all the time,\u201d she added.\n\nEvonne Gan, Singapore-based engagement manager for asset management advisory at Broadridge, pointed out that investors in the city-state could access offshore active ETFs via private banking or online securities channels, so just looking at locally listed products did not give the full picture on investor appetite.\n\nLocally listed ETFs in Singapore recorded the highest outflows among all Asia Pacific markets between January and May this year, with cumulative outflows of $278.5mn.\n\nBut Gan was still optimistic that domestic interest in active ETFs would grow.\n\nThe Singapore bourse was \u201cactively engaging\u201d with issuers who had \u201cstrong capabilities in originating mutual funds to utilise ETFs as another conduit to reach a wider audience through a listed vehicle\u201d, an SGX Group spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cActive ETFs are a relatively new concept in Singapore, reflecting the evolving nature of the investment landscape here,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

Fifteen years as a proprietary trader at Singapore-based United Overseas Bank seemed more than enough. \u201cThere\u2019s a shelf life to trading,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing much to show for your effort except the plus and minus of an accounts book.\u201d\n\nHe looked around for inspiration. He had enjoyed spending time with an architect while commissioning a property in his native Singapore, and kept thinking of the Canadian prairies, where he had spent time as an undergraduate in Saskatchewan. A combination of nature and design felt alluring. So he changed tack and qualified as a landscape architect, taking courses at night while working at the bank. \u201cOne day I was head of the prop desk for bonds trading, and literally the next day I was an intern at the National Parks Board.\u201d\n\nThe transition was tough, but his commitment paid off. Last year Ng was named Singapore\u2019s President\u2019s Design Award \u201cdesigner of the year\u201d \u2014 having previously won four \u201cdesign of the year\u201d titles. Collectively they recognise 16 years of involvement in making Singapore become a garden city, one of the greenest in the world.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise then, that we meet in the garden of Ng\u2019s home, a light-filled two-storey house designed by local architects RT+Q, in Singapore\u2019s Leedon Estate, a hilly pocket of luxury gated houses.\n\nThere is a deliberate lack of order to his garden: \u201cI wanted to feel like you\u2019re in a natural forest,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are no straight lines here. The leaf litter is left on the ground and the trees are unevenly spread.\u201d The garden is multi-layered, just like a rainforest: Borneo Kauri, Malayan Crape Myrtle and Umbrella trees create a canopy, epiphytes grow from the boughs at mid-level and Chinese Fan Palms dot the ground.\n\nPartly, this is a practical matter: \u201cI wanted it to be a self-sustaining low-maintenance landscape. Being a landscape architect, I\u2019m kind of picky, but I don\u2019t really have a lot of time.\u201d\n\nNg points out that the garden is grass-free \u2014 remarkably, this award-winning landscape specialist doesn\u2019t own a lawnmower \u2014 and instead Ng has harvested and cultivated a tough and drought-tolerant local weed, and repurposed it into a resemblance of a lawn, flowing like a waterfall over a step.\n\nThe house itself is custom-designed to combine two dwellings, one for himself and his wife and children (15, 17 and 19), and one for his in-laws, separated by a central lift. Everything is open, with nature invited in: the big open-plan kitchen flows directly to the front garden in one direction and a pool area in the other. Hornbills are frequent visitors; so too are squirrels, who have a habit of stealing their fruit. The garden seems like an extra room, intrinsic to the home.\n\nA heavy wooden dining table is as curved as the garden, shaped to keep the natural characteristics of the tree it came from. A corridor is repurposed as a sort of unhidden shed; tools and a chainsaw hanging in neat order on the wall.\n\nNg has a passion for collecting antique searchlights sourced from old warships, admiring \u201cthe combination of industrial aesthetics, function of communication and illumination\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and the history\u201d. They stand in corners of rooms, adding to the industrial feel. His in-laws\u2019 collection of life-sized bronze figures from the Qin and Han dynasties, by Chinese artist Cai Zhisong, also populate the house, reclining by a spiral staircase, standing like sentries near the entrance.\n\nUpstairs, in his home office, past a large master bedroom with a wooden ceiling fan more often seen in Singapore\u2019s older, colonial-era homes, another passion is indulged: minerals and crystals, an interest Ng shares with one of his daughters. The crystals bloom from small boxes on shelves. Smaller plants thrive here under the attention of photographic lights of sufficient sophistication to impress the FT\u2019s photographer. Ng works beneath a road sign saying Frankel Walk, a memory of his previous home on Singapore\u2019s east coast; his family bought it in an auction when the signs were renewed.\n\nAs we wander through the house, Ng\u2019s attention constantly turns to the plants within and around it. On the roof of the home gym, by the swimming pool, Ng points out hanging plants meshed into fabric on the roof; they reduce heat and the need for air conditioning. By the pool are Australian weeping tea trees, and in a separate Japanese-style garden area in his in-laws\u2019 wing of the home, koi carp drift in a pond angled (by Ng) to create a sense of lengthened perspective. There are Swamp Sheoaks (casuarina glaucas \u2014 playfully known as Cousin Itt for their resemblance to the Addams Family character) draped on the ground like a carpet. Herbs grow in pots. Ng can name every plant in its Latin form; if we go that way, I tell him, the story is going to require quite the fact check.\n\nA series of pools leads visitors to the entrance and garden. This feels right, because from the very outset, water has characterised Ng\u2019s approach to landscape design.\n\nSingapore has a close relationship with water, and not just because it is an island nation. As one of his first acts as leader, founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew elevated water to a national security issue; he recalled only too well the British surrender of Singapore in February 1942, forced, more than anything else, by the fact that the Japanese army had taken the reservoirs. \u201cIn most countries, water is a need, not national security,\u201d Ng says. \u201cBut for us, it\u2019s existential.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we have a large hinterland where we can collect water and supply ourselves. If there\u2019s not enough water on the island, we are beholden to someone else.\u201d\n\nSingapore has the best drainage in south-east Asia, to avoid floods when the tropical rains fall, and sophisticated mechanisms to ensure water supply. But to Ng, there is a greater possibility in water. Collecting water is only part of the challenge, he says. \u201cNext we need to make sure [that] water becomes cleaner. And you do that by trying to change people\u2019s mindset and their relationship with water.\u201d\n\nNg first trialled this while working on the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park project, his first assignment for the German landscaping firm Atelier Dreiseitl \u2014 later known as Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl \u2014 after joining in 2008 (the firm was rebranded Henning Larsen in 2023, where Ng is country market director). This was a pilot initiative to combine rainfall collection, recycling, and the animation of public spaces. \u201cAnd then hopefully the public will engage with these spaces, build a sense of ownership, and be less inclined to pollute the water source,\u201d Ng says. That means cleaner water, less energy for recycling, \u201cand it all comes together. It\u2019s really not about designing the river so much as it is redesigning our relationship with water.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly fitting in Singapore, he says, \u201cwhere every square metre of land is really valuable to us. We cannot afford to have mono-functional uses.\u201d A canal, say, cannot be just for drainage, but also supply and recreation. \u201cSo instead of having one function, now there\u2019s three functions. That\u2019s why we design in layers.\u201d\n\nBishan was, and remains, enormously important to Ng. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out in Bishan park and see people playing and laughing and having a good time, chasing the butterflies and really appreciating it, that really validates the effort.\u201d\n\nThis thinking is visible in many of his later projects: the water play areas at Jurong Lake Garden; the multipurpose model of the Kampung Admiralty building, where the community is bonded through a multi-tiered roof garden filled with local plants. It will be central to his next major assignment, creating mixed-use shared spaces above a 21.5km tunnel network called the North-South Corridor.\n\nAll of these principles are clear in Ng\u2019s home: the interplay of physical structures and nature, the idea that a house and the gardens around it are one and the same. There is a symbiosis here: his work as a landscape architect informs the place he lives, and his home in turn informs his work.\n\n\u201cThis is my sanctuary,\u201d Ng says. \u201cAfter a day of stress you come back and you feel energised. You go out to the greenery and you get inspired to come up with new ideas.\u201d\n\nAnd those ideas are informed by the plants around him. \u201cNature is inherently beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cNature doesn\u2019t require design, and the best we can do is learn from it. But even if we can only produce a poor facsimile of nature, how do we do that in an authentic and faithful manner? That\u2019s what I strive to do as a designer.\u201d\n\nChris Wright is a contributing reporter for the FT, Singapore\n\nSingapore Design Week runs from September 26 to October 6\n\nThis article has been amended.

And even if you have burnt through your three meals a day, a final round of food and drinks with friends is always popular, especially given the plethora of eateries that remain open well into the evening.\n\nTypically, supper fare here is likely to be fried, toasted or grilled over a hot stove. Dishes range from a plate of crispy roti prata \u2014 an Indian-style pancake served with a side of fish curry, which is offered by many late-night food stalls \u2014 or a serving of Chinese-style noodles flash-fried in a wok and dripping with gravy.\n\nI lean on the side of living dangerously and prefer to risk putting on a few extra pounds if it means I can dig into a plate of prata, topped with generous amounts of sugar and soaked in curry. So if you are in Singapore, here are some places where you can get your fix if hunger pangs suddenly strike at odd hours. Beyond the food itself, some of them are also interesting spots in which to greet the early hours.\n\nAbove this supper spot, there used to be a neon sign for \u201cRolex Mee Master Tan Kue Kim\u201d. Mee is a term that locals use to refer to noodles, and Master Tan, the late patron of Kim\u2019s Famous Fried Hokkien\u00a0Prawn Mee, was often seen at night frying up wok-fried delights for his customers. Tan, who died this year, was known for dishing plate after plate of fried noodles in the Chinese Hokkien style. His capable assistants have since taken over the kitchen.\n\nWhile one may question the wisdom of donning a luxury timepiece worth thousands of dollars in a greasy kitchen, but the charismatic Tan made it his calling card, as you can see in the articles about the restaurant plastered proudly across the walls.\n\nThe noodles are a calorie-laden adventure, coated in a savoury prawn-infused seafood stock, with shredded egg, squid, shrimp, deep-fried cubes of pork lard and\u00a0sambal (chilli paste), accompanied by sliced lime on the side. The way to do it is to mix the noodles with the paste and squeeze out all the juice from the lime. For foodies looking for a late-night meal with some heat, this is a fine spot. Those not in the mood for noodles will find plenty of alternatives, from fried mussels to steamed fish head and crabs cooked a variety of ways.\n\nOrchard Road, the city-state\u2019s main shopping street, is usually on the list of places to visit in Singapore. Caf\u00e9 de Muse, situated on two floors of the Shaw House mall,\u00a0is a useful pit-stop for those on a night-time buying spree. Shops typically close around 9pm, but this place remains open round the clock.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 offers Korean-inspired Asian fusion food, with dishes such as bulgogi pasta \u2014 spaghetti cooked with slices of beef in a tangy-sweet sauce \u2014 and kimchi fried rice. Western fare is also available, from duck confit to chicken roulade, as well as lighter dishes such as Caesar salad and a range of teas and coffees.\n\nThis caf\u00e9 occupies a strategic location at the intersection of busy streets in Singapore\u2019s Muslim quarter. It has some alfresco seating, which makes for a pleasant supper on a clear balmy night.\n\nKampong Glam Caf\u00e9 specialises in Singaporean Malay comfort food such as nasi goreng pattaya daging, or fried rice with beef, hidden under a thin egg omelette drizzled with sweet chilli sauce, and nasi lemak \u2014 coconut-flavoured rice paired with fried chicken, egg, cucumber, deep-fried crispy fingernail-length anchovies and a glob of sambal.\n\nTry a cup of hot or iced teh cino, which is an extremely sweet tea and milk drink loosely based on cappuccino. For something more refreshing, go for teh o limau, sugary black tea infused with chunks of lime.\n\nIf you pick the right seat, you can have a fabulous view of the golden dome of the Sultan Mosque, the centrepiece of the Muslim quarter. This is a popular tourist spot, so it is maybe not the place for a relaxed meal.\n\nThose with a passion for motoring will probably find this supper spot right up their street. The Fujiwara Tofu Concept Shop is modelled after the Japanese street-racing manga series Initial D, which has an avid following and was made into an Asian action flick in 2005.\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade looks as if it has come straight out of the comic, bearing the same name as the tofu store operated by Bunta Fujiwara, the father of Takumi Fujiwara, who is the main protagonist of the series.\n\nNo visit is complete without ordering a side of the titular Fujiwara tofu, deep-fried and topped with mildly spicy chilli. The store mainly serves finger food, from Japanese scallop sashimi to skewers of barbecue-glazed yakitori chicken thigh \u2014 ideally paired with a pint of Sapporo beer, or rounds of soju and sake.\n\nFans of Japanese-style izakaya dining are likely to feel at home here. But the real attraction is the cars that pull up to this eatery on a regular basis \u2014 the type of exotic motors often seen in posters on young petrolheads\u2019 bedroom walls. Their drivers like to live out their Initial D fantasies by using the caf\u00e9 as a backdrop for photos, although ironically parking spaces are limited.\n\nSimpang Bedok is a legendary location for late-night food in eastern Singapore. It is not one restaurant, but a collection of places concentrated in one area offering a range of different cuisines.\n\nHere you will find the Bedok Market Place, sited above a supermarket, where a variety of stalls serve up quick eats showcasing Singapore\u2019s street- food culture. These are fine for dinner, but the market largely closes after 9pm. Surrounding the supermarket is a cluster of eateries where locals head for real supper food. These close later, after midnight, while some are open around the clock. One of the latter is the Indian-Muslim New Mahamoodiya Restaurant, located across the street from the Bedok Market complex. It has a seemingly endless menu of roti prata \u2014 Indian-style pancakes, prepared in a variety of ways. Roti prata paired with curry is a favourite supper dish with locals, and you can choose between sweet or savoury, stuffed with anything from egg to cheese to mushroom, or just on their own with the curry.\n\nRoti prata is a crispier version of naan flatbread, and New Mahamoodiya\u2019s creations are known to pack a crunch. One of the crunchiest is \u201ctissue prata\u201d, thin fried dough twisted into a shape resembling a wizard\u2019s hat, and coated in sauces from caramel to honey and condensed milk.\n\nWash it all down with \u201cMilo dino\u201d, a cloyingly sweet chocolate-based drink topped with cocoa powder and sprinkles. Food at Simpang Bedok is greasy, sugary, spicy heaven.\n\nWhere do you go for late-night food in Singapore? Tell us in the comments below.

My parents were both very interested in tennis, which was quite a big and relatively accessible sport in Singapore. I started playing when I was about six years old and, quite quickly, I noticed that, \u201cOK, this is something that I\u2019m actually quite good at.\u201d Tennis became a full-time job on the side of school \u2014 I travelled all around Asia, playing in tournaments.\n\nIt is quite a hectic and stressful lifestyle. Most days would be packed with morning training, then I\u2019d go to school and then, in the evening, training again. On weekends, I\u2019d play tournaments. It was a lot of work. You sacrifice a lot; you don\u2019t grow up as a normal kid. It\u2019s not possible to go to late-night events or hang out with friends, because there is training the next morning, or travel for a tournament. But you also get a lot of opportunities.\n\nAfter I graduated from high school, I got a full athletic scholarship to play division one college tennis, for the University of Wisconsin in Madison. I studied economics and my days continued being similar, filled with training, but, on the weekends, I would travel to different universities. It was fun \u2014 tennis was what I loved.\n\nWhen the time came to look for a masters, I started thinking about leaving the US. I had been able to study there because of my scholarship, which paid not only my tuition but accommodation. Without it\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009university studies in the US are just so expensive. At the same time, I had started thinking about going back to my roots. I wanted to feel the Finnish side of me, as I had never really lived there.\n\nI knew I wanted an international university, where I could study in English. Then I saw that the masters in business and management at Hanken School of Economics offered a specialisation in marketing, which was a perfect fit for how I pictured my future.\n\nThe programme was two years long, with a mix of many different courses and a thesis at the end. It was a very international group and a good mix of those who had come straight from the bachelors degree, versus some who had already worked and came back to do their masters. Hanken was smaller than the average US university, which I liked, as it meant students felt part of a community. The classes, being smaller, meant there was plenty of space for group work and interaction with classmates and professors.\n\nThere were also a lot of chances to get involved in activities and clubs, so I co-founded the Hanken tennis club. I was part of the masters committee, which organised events and workshops for masters students, and the sports committee, which planned activities for students. There were a lot of opportunities to feel part of the community.\n\nMany of my favourite classes were marketing-related, but I also took a lot of finance and accounting classes to broaden my knowledge. Most interesting were probably strategic marketing and marketing communications, where we learn how to market across cultures. They helped give me a sense of which kind of marketing I wanted to do.\n\nMany people think marketing is essentially advertising, but there\u2019s so much more behind it. For example: how can you grow an audience for a sport? How can you make the experience better for the fans? That\u2019s essentially what I do now. I work for a company called Two Circles, in Bern, in Switzerland. We grow the value of sports, backed by data. We use data to understand sports fans to, for example, grow audiences, increase engagement or improve ticketing strategies. It combines my passion for sports with what I learnt at Hanken on the marketing side.\n\nThe main things I took with me from Hanken were soft skills from group projects and presentations that the small class sizes enabled us to have. I learnt how to work with people, to listen and learn from others \u2014 how to ask constructive questions and maintain a solution mindset. A lot of those skills came from being active in student unions.\n\nI want to keep working in the sports industry \u2014 I really enjoy it. And, one day, I think, I will want to return to Finland. My time at Hanken gave me time to get to know the country, and now Helsinki feels like home. I made a lot of friends there. I built a good base for when, in the future, at some point, I\u2019ll want to move back.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/bfeea54c-a9ef-409b-af48-5e4fff9b560b"}, {"uuid4": "529f1c43-9d65-4bcf-b782-59f12ab0ca4e", "title": "Modi government rolls out tax cuts in effort to stimulate growth", "description": "Sweeteners for middle classes aimed at reinvigorating the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy", "author": "Andres Schipani", "published_date": "2025-02-01T09:36:11.250Z", "content": "India announced tax breaks for the middle classes and measures meant to improve the ease of doing business as Narendra Modi\u2019s government unveiled its first full-year budget since an economic slowdown that followed his re-election last year.\n\nThe sweeteners for middle-income Indians, as well as small and mid-size businesses, came alongside steps aimed at reinvigorating the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy and reviving demand among urban consumers, a core political base for Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party.\n\nNirmala Sitharaman, finance minister, on Saturday announced an increase in the personal income tax threshold below which taxpayers owe no tax to Rs1.2mn ($13,842), up from Rs700,000, as well as an uplift in brackets for the rates levied on taxable income. She said that the government would introduce a new income tax bill next week.\n\nThe finance minister added that the new rates would \u201csubstantially reduce the taxes of the middle class and leave more money in their hands, boosting household consumption, savings and investment\u201d, as ruling coalition MPs chanted \u201cModi, Modi\u201d.\n\nAmong measures meant to make doing business easier, Sitharaman said a high-level committee for regulatory reforms that would review India\u2019s rules, certifications, licences, and permissions governing business as well as the creation of an investment friendliness index of states, would be launched this year.\n\n\u201cA light touch regulatory framework based on principles and trust will unleash productivity and employment,\u201d Sitharaman said.\n\nBusiness groups have long urged India to reduce onerous paperwork and compliance burdens and reform the rules governing labour and land markets to stimulate investment and create jobs.\n\n\u201cThe focus of the budget has, basically, come in consumption via taxation cuts to support lower income and middle income segments of society, because that\u2019s where the pain point has been very visible,\u201d said Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services in Mumbai.\n\nIndia has bounced back since the Covid-19 pandemic and remains the world\u2019s fastest-growing big economy, but GDP growth in the second fiscal quarter that ended in September was 5.4 per cent, the slowest in nearly two years.\n\nDespite strong infrastructure spending by the state, private investment has been sluggish and job creation weak. Inflation has been trending near the top of the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s mandated band of 4-6 per cent, limiting its scope to cut lending rates.\n\nVijayaraghavan Swaminathan, head of research at Avendus Spark Institutional Equities in Chennai, said the government\u2019s intent in announcing the tax cuts was \u201cvery clear\u201d and that they would give middle-class households \u201ca breather\u201d.\n\nIn a special trading session on Saturday, India\u2019s benchmark Nifty 50 blue-chip index fell 0.5 per cent, though consumer stocks were buoyed by Sitharaman\u2019s moves to lower income tax pressures.\n\n\u201cThe market is confused as of now,\u201d said Swaminathan. \u201cA lot of numbers remain to be seen, including how the government is going to accommodate this tax collection hit.\u201d\n\nIn India\u2019s annual Economic Survey, published by the government on Friday, the finance ministry painted a stark picture of the challenges faced by the youth and the economy. These included a reliance on China for supply chains serving critical industries such as solar power, advanced batteries and electric vehicles.\n\nThe report, authored by Modi\u2019s chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran, also urged India\u2019s central and state governments to \u201cget out of the way\u201d and deregulate the economy or face a \u201chigh risk of economic growth stagnation, if not economic stagnation\u201d.\n\nThe report forecast real GDP growth of 6.4 per cent for the current fiscal year, down from 8.2 per cent in 2023-4.

Outside of India, Bissell is best known as the animating force behind Fabindia, the textile and clothing brand founded by her American husband John Bissell.\n\nTributes since her death in January have used words like \u201ccatalyst\u201d, \u201cconnector\u201d, and \u201csaloniste\u201d to capture the place she occupied for decades in Delhi at a time when India\u2019s traditionalist society and protected economy were opening to the wider world.\n\nSome remember how Bissell dressed \u2014 elegant saris, bespoke outfits tailored from cotton kurta cloth, silver bangles \u2014 or the food she served. From the 1960s, the Bissells hosted a Christmas brunch attended by as many as 300-400 people that featured western breakfast meats like bacon and sausage alongside southern Indian vegetarian fare like dosas and idli.\n\n\u201cBim was a quintessential Punjabi who had to feed you,\u201d says Poonam Muttreja, a friend. Around the Bissells\u2019 table at their house \u2014 first in South Delhi\u2019s New Friends Colony, then later in Panchsheel Park \u2014 you would find artists and writers seated alongside politicians, diplomats with leftist nongovernmental activists \u2014 a curated but eclectic crowd engaged in sparky debate about India, sometimes for the benefit of prominent foreign visitors passing through town, from architect Buckminster Fuller and John F Kennedy Jr to Jordan\u2019s Princess Firyal.\n\nAt these dinners, Bissell kept two tables at opposite ends of the room, strategically swapping guests between them when the conversation got too hot \u2014 \u201clike putting control rods into a nuclear reactor\u201d says William Bissell, Bimla\u2019s son and managing director of Fabindia, when recalling his mother\u2019s \u201ctwo-table policy\u201d.\n\nBimla Nanda Bissell \u2014 known to friends as Bim \u2014 was born in Quetta, British India, in 1932 (now Pakistan\u2019s Balochistan province) to a father who was a veterinarian. She studied at Sacred Heart Convent School and Kinnaird College in Lahore before her family relocated to Pune and then Delhi in the months before Partition tore apart the subcontinent, when her father became the newly independent India\u2019s husbandry commissioner.\n\nBissell had a brief and unhappy arranged marriage to a government aide. When it failed, she separated from him and went to the US to pursue a masters in education from the University of Michigan \u2014 an unusually independent move for an Indian woman at the time.\n\nAfter returning to India in 1957, Bissell took over a nursery school her sister had founded in Delhi, transforming it into one of the city\u2019s first Montessori schools.\u00a0She also helped to develop the crafts base at the Central Cottage Industries Corp, a clearing house for traditional handicrafts and handloom textiles. The following year she met John Bissell, who was advising Indian craftspeople on a grant from the Ford Foundation. In a 2011 interview with The Hindu Business Line, she recalls her colleague saying to her, \u201cHe won\u2019t last long, will you please give [him] your room for the time being?\u201d\n\nThe couple wed five years later in the backyard of then-US ambassador Chester Bowles, a friend of John\u2019s parents. By then, Bimla was working as a social secretary for US envoys, having first taken the role for Bowles\u2019 predecessor John Kenneth Galbraith in 1961. (She would work for four, including Daniel Patrick Moynihan.) That same year, her husband founded Fabindia, though Bimla was crucial in forging contacts with artisans.\n\nThe brand found\u00a0a market with its traditional saris, Nehru jackets and kurta pyjamas, bringing traditional styles and homespun fabrics into the present with bright colours and modern marketing.\n\nIn her role at Delhi\u2019s US embassy, Bissell was key in shaping the ambassadors\u2019 understanding of India at a time when the country leaned heavily toward the Soviet Union \u2014 Washington and Delhi had frequently testy ties. She played a similar role at the World Bank as external affairs officer for 21 years from 1975, helping the organisation\u2019s expat staffers to navigate India but also introducing Indians to a multilateral institution they viewed with suspicion. \u201cShe was good at brokering \u2014 not having things escalate by bringing people to the table for dialogue,\u201d her daughter Monsoon Bissell remembers.\n\nJohn Bissell died in 1998, but Bimla remained a mentor to some, connector of many, and informal gatekeeper for prominent visitors to India. At one dinner in the mid-2010s, after the publication of The Blood Telegram, Gary J Bass\u2019 book about the 1971 birth of Bangladesh which presented Richard Nixon\u2019s India policy in a deeply unflattering light, Bissell\u2019s children remember Henry Kissinger being grilled bluntly by other guests, but gamely fielding the questions.\n\nAccording to Monsoon, when someone once approached her mother about writing a memoir, she replied: \u201cThat I can\u2019t do because these stories belong to other people\u201d.\u00a0Her parents, she says, \u201chad a front row seat on a changing world where they were both committed to making it easier for everyone around them\u201d.\u00a0\u201cMy mother showed up, always, no matter the circumstances, and never said no if she could help someone out,\u201d Monsoon says. \u201cThat\u2019s a dying art.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e1ade26f-bd0e-4c28-b6bf-15316319c634"}, {"uuid4": "c8ceb855-ca4a-40df-a9a6-b26221758609", "title": "Gauri Gill\u2019s photographs of the Indian farmers\u2019 protests", "description": "The artist was drawn to the ingenuity and beauty of the year-long Delhi blockades", "author": "Snigdha Poonam", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.586Z", "content": "Cauliflower plants stand in orderly rows across a patch of freshly tilled soil. Not yet in bloom, the garden is bordered by colourful tarpaulins, as if to shield the buds from wandering cattle. On one end, a low concrete boundary has been built, a subtle assertion of ownership. A water container rests serenely on a stone platform. Beyond the polyester divider, a bamboo hut peeks into view, its slanting roof also padded with tarpaulin. Perhaps it\u2019s the home of the person who owns the vegetable patch.\n\nLooking at this photograph, one might imagine it was taken deep in India\u2019s hinterlands, where bamboo huts remain a familiar sight and growing vegetables is a way of life. But this hut and the garden were located not in a village but on a major road leading to Delhi.\n\nPhotographer Gauri Gill\u2019s The Village on the Highway is a visual homage to an extraordinary feat of imagination, one that sprung from a year-long stand-off between the Indian state and the people who till the land. Its roots lie in three controversial laws passed in 2020 to reform the agricultural sector, which employs about half of the population, most of them earning woefully little. Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed ownership of the reforms, asserting they granted farmers autonomy. Freed from socialist-era price regulations and local middlemen\u2019s diktats, farmers were now ostensibly free to sell their crops to the highest bidder, whether state-owned companies or global supply chains.\n\nThe intended beneficiaries did not see it that way. Already strained by rising costs, recurrent droughts and mounting debts, many farmers feared they would be thrust into an unequal marketplace, putting their livelihoods at the mercy of powerful corporations.\n\nInitially, groups of farmers staged protests in their regions. Two months later, frustrated by the government\u2019s refusal to listen, some of them marched en masse towards Delhi. That November, hundreds of thousands of farmers, many of them Sikh, set off on foot and in farming vehicles \u2014 tractors, tempos, truck trailers \u2014 from Punjab and Haryana, north India\u2019s agrarian heartlands.\n\nBut the convoy could not enter the capital. At the Singhu border, police and paramilitary personnel stood behind tall metal barricades armed with batons, water cannons and tear gas. The farmers refused to back off. Instead they decided to lay siege to the border, blocking the highway.\n\nSetting up a temporary base required enormous creativity and resourcefulness, efforts that caught Gill\u2019s attention when she visited the Singhu border. \u201cThey began to repurpose the very vehicles that they had arrived on, or the farming equipment that they used daily and knew intimately, into uniquely habitable homes,\u201d she tells me over email. Uncertain how long they would stay, the farmers created spaces where they could sleep, cook and bathe. Where an empty road had stood, there were suddenly bedrooms, storerooms and living rooms. Communal spaces such as libraries, medical camps, small shops and round-the-clock kitchens manifested as if out of thin air.\n\nAs a photographer, Gill was drawn to this \u201chandmade and homegrown architecture of resistance\u201d, as she calls it, which was built on the farmers\u2019 ability to evoke beauty using the barest of objects and materials. \u201cDoors appeared through tarpaulin, walls arose from bamboo and thermocol, and string and tape held together wood,\u201d she recalls.\n\nEach makeshift structure carried a spark of individuality, a touch of quirkiness. Some featured plain jute curtains, others synthetic ones adorned with bold floral patterns. Doors ranged from plain cloth nailed to the backs of trucks to solid bamboo constructions complete with windows, frames and latches.\n\nAs with much of her previous work, Gill\u2019s focus was on highlighting \u201cthe beauty and generosity in places of profound precarity and acute injustice\u201d. The absence of people in these photographs \u2014 a deliberate choice to protect their identities \u2014 does not diminish their centrality. Each domestic object, a pot on a stove or a bucket of bathing water, conveys their presence.\n\nThe farmers stayed for four seasons. In summer, \u00adkhus- (vetiver) infused air coolers were installed. In colder months, thick blankets padded the walls. In the monsoons, mosquito nets shrouded the sleeping areas.\n\nSome of these items arrived with friends and relatives from villages hundreds of miles away, along with fresh food supplies grown in the farms to sustain the langars, or communal kitchens, a cornerstone of the Sikh way of life. The langars fed not only the protesters and their allies but also the police officers posted at the border. Yet, despite their efforts to persevere, hundreds of protesters died, succumbing to harsh weather conditions, age-related complications, dengue fever, accidents and illnesses.\n\nIn November 2021, the government passed a motion to repeal the laws. With their mission accomplished, the farmers dismantled their temporary homes, bid farewell to friends and comrades, and began their journeys home.\n\nThe Indian farmers\u2019 protest of 2020\u201421 is remembered as one of the longest non-violent protests in contemporary history. It is also a rare instance of ordinary citizens triumphing over an unyielding state. Yet it was marked by countless moments when it seemed that the lights were about to go out.\n\n\u201cThe stand-off had gone on so long, it seemed nothing might ever change,\u201d Gill recalls. \u201cFarmers were dying. I felt down, even as a visitor.\u201d Yet their spirits did not waver. \u201cI remember doughty elders saying to me, \u2018One day the tide will turn.\u2019\u201d\n\nGill reflects on the Sikh phrase Chardi Kala, which means choosing optimism even when you can see the difficulties that lie ahead, indeed because of those difficulties. She could feel the farmers drawing strength from it. \u201cI saw that spirit,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe Village on the Highway\u201d is at Vadehra Art Gallery, New Delhi, from February 4 to March 4\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend Magazine on X and FT Weekend on Instagram", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c2dfb9fc-b2cb-4e37-85d4-13bf77658a3f"}, {"uuid4": "8123ba1c-078c-439e-817c-9eb3939fb495", "title": "A pivotal budget for India", "description": "Also in this newsletter, media companies take OpenAI to court and the tragedy at the Kumbh Mela", "author": "Veena Venugopal", "published_date": "2025-01-31T01:30:43.956Z", "content": "Good morning. Journalists all over the world have worn down the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cI\u201d keys on their computers this week and I am no exception. Media companies owned by India\u2019s richest people \u2014 Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani \u2014 have joined a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI in the Delhi high court. This is the first big case that could determine some critical issues around training rules for generative AI.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s set the scene for tomorrow. Just another Saturday for the world. But Budget Day for India.\n\nI will confess that over the past few years my interest in the Union Budget waned. It was becoming a noisy event with little impact on on-the-ground realities. There would be some bickering about this or that tax for a few days and then we would all go back to our regular lives. But tomorrow when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents her budget proposals in parliament, I\u2019ll be paying close attention. This (financial) year India has been caught in a deadlock of a falling growth rate, high inflation, high interest rates and high unemployment, and Sitharaman\u2019s proposals have the power to determine the course of the economy.\n\nMy guess is that the minister will rely on public spending on infrastructure to boost growth. This will spread public money more widely in the economy and drive up job numbers. Besides, this has been a cornerstone of the Modi government; great roads are also a good talking point during elections. But Sitharaman will have to keep an eye on the fiscal deficit, which the government has targeted at 4.9 per cent of GDP for the year ending March, and so the amount of money she can allocate to infrastructure development will be restricted.\n\nOne perennial budget demand is for a cut in income taxes for the salaried middle-class in India. This year, though, the frustration of this segment \u2014 which pays taxes but does not access some public services like government-run schools or hospitals \u2014 is particularly intense. There is all kinds of speculation about proposed changes, but the most persistent one is that a fourth tax bracket might be introduced. According to local media reports, the government is working on a new income tax act to replace the current law and has been consulting experts for feedback and suggestions. My guess is that it will be unveiled at a later date (perhaps with a complicated Hindi name like the Indian Penal Code, or Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, was in 2024) and the big changes in the tax structure will come then.\n\nThe one thing I feel certain about is that there will be some AI-related announcements. The budget speech has, in recent years, become an exercise in signalling intent by the government. This week there has been a lot of angst about India\u2019s inability to develop an innovative AI product like China\u2019s DeepSeek. The government will use the budget to announce an initiative or two to get on the AI bandwagon. However, these kinds of programmes have had limited success in the past. Schemes like Start up India, Skill India and Digital India, which were announced with much fanfare, have seen their budget outlays shrink every year.\n\nSitharaman\u2019s budget speeches have got shorter over the years. In 2020, she spoke for two hours and 40 minutes, but in 2023 wrapped it up in 87 minutes. (I\u2019m ignoring 2024 because it was an election year and there were two mini-budgets). I only hope she keeps it crisp this year and focuses on the larger, more important points that will help move the needle on the economy and not get bogged down with detailed explanations about minor initiatives. It\u2019s a Saturday, after all.\n\nDo you have any questions about the Budget? Write to us at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply and we\u2019ll answer them next week.\n\nOn the off chance that I haven\u2019t typed AI enough times today, here\u2019s some more. OpenAI is having a terrible week. Globally, it was rattled by the emergence of a scrappier competitor, DeepSeek, and in India, large media companies joined publishers in a lawsuit against the US company. As chronicled by Indian media, the original case was filed by the Indian newswire service, Asian News International (ANI), in November 2024 in the Delhi high court. ANI alleged that OpenAI was training ChatGPT using copyrighted content without authorisation. In early January, the Federation of Indian Publishers joined the case and this week, the Digital News Publishers Association \u2014 whose members include media houses owned by Ambani and Adani \u2014 filed interventions in the case too. OpenAI has questioned the jurisdiction of the court and is contesting the addition of the two new groups since the key issues raised by them are different from those being contested with ANI. (Book publishers, for example, contend that ChatGPT publishes summaries and extracts, but OpenAI\u2019s view is that it picks up the information from publicly available sources and therefore there is no infringement of copyright.)\n\nThe case will be keenly watched as it is grapples with critical questions about copyright in the age of generative artificial intelligence. Most significantly, the court could determine that use of copyrighted data qualifies as \u201cfair use\u201d for AI developers. If OpenAI is able to convince the court of this, it will open up an enormous trove of material to train its software on. (The company is facing similar lawsuits in other countries too.) Detailed hearings are scheduled to begin on February 21. I\u2019ll keep you posted.\n\nTragedy struck at the Kumbh Mela this week when a stampede broke out early on Wednesday morning.\u00a0Here\u2019s what we know, so far.\n\nIt\u2019s a working weekend for me, alas, and I will be spending most of it in front of a screen. If I can manage to find some time, I hope to get started on the gritty sequel of Paatal Lok on Amazon Prime. I know I\u2019m way behind most people on this, but I have been watching Black Warrant on Netflix and it fulfils my weekly quota for gruesome content, thank you very much. As a palate cleanser between episodes, I watched this lovely Thai film, How to Make Millions before Grandma Dies (also on Netflix). I highly recommend it.\n\nIt\u2019s been a very busy work week and my reading, too, is suffering. I have been dipping into Nina Stibbe\u2019s memoir Went to London, Took the Dog for a few minutes before bed every night. It\u2019s hilarious and wholesome.\n\nI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have any strong recommendations for anything else this weekend (or next, actually). Send me yours.\n\nWhat is Nato trying to prevent by deploying drones, submarines, ships and aircraft in the Baltic Sea?\n\nSend your answer to indiabrief@ft.com and check Tuesday\u2019s newsletter to see if you were the first one to get it right.\n\nOn Tuesday, we asked: Do you think the Indian stock market will bounce back after the budget?

CVC declined to comment.\n\nA stake in Birmingham Phoenix was also on the block, with bidding for stakes in the remaining teams set for the coming days, as the opportunity to buy into English cricket attracts a range of international investors.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board, which is selling the team stakes, has pitched The Hundred auction as a rare chance to buy into a closed league in one of the sport\u2019s biggest markets. It hopes to emulate the success of the Indian Premier League, one of the world\u2019s richest sports properties with multibillion-dollar TV deals. However, The Hundred is still in its infancy and brings in just \u00a340mn a year from broadcast rights.\n\nThe Glazer family, which controls the Manchester United football team, and a consortium that includes Chelsea Football Club co-owner Todd Boehly, are among potential suitors who have shown interest in buying stakes in the franchises. Owners of several teams in the lucrative Indian Premier League are also expected to bid.\n\nVictory for the Ambanis means they have exclusivity and are set to finalise documentation in the coming weeks, according to one of the people. Taking the stake in Oval Invincibles would add to their global cricket interests, which include teams in South Africa, the US and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe Ambanis, majority owners of Reliance Industries, are among India\u2019s richest and most influential families, with their business interests extending from energy to telecommunications.\n\nThe family also has interests in entertainment and sport, including ownership of the Mumbai Indians cricket franchise, five-time winners of the lucrative IPL. At last year\u2019s Paris Olympics, Nita Ambani, who is married to tycoon Mukesh Ambani, campaigned for India to host a future Games.\n\nThe sale of the eight teams that compete in The Hundred is a pivotal moment for the future of the game. The ECB initially aimed to raise \u00a3500mn from the auction process but has recently discussed a figure of \u00a3350mn.\n\nThat money has been earmarked to help professional cricket clubs invest in infrastructure upgrades and new revenue sources, such as building hotels or conference facilities at their stadiums. It will also help some clubs reduce their debts.\n\nThe ECB hopes the arrival of professional investors into The Hundred will boost the competition\u2019s appeal both at home and abroad by bringing in fresh expertise in areas such as marketing and fan engagement.\n\nThe new owners will also enable the ECB to increase some of the spending caps in the contest so that it can compete for top cricket talent against the many other short-form competitions that have sprung up across the world.\n\nBringing in deep-pocketed investors will also help The Hundred to attract top cricketers to play in the competition, at a time when star talent can command seven-figure sums to participate in the IPL.\n\nHowever, the competition itself has proved controversial with long-standing cricket fans, with critics complaining that the format is simply a gimmick designed for children and casual viewers.", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8f942383-0c6b-48ec-ab00-10eaca956897"}, {"uuid4": "350724f2-bca7-4b6a-abcb-736236394c38", "title": "India\u2019s Narendra Modi faces tough budget challenge as economy slows", "description": "Finance minister under pressure to revive growth while maintaining fiscal discipline", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2025-01-30T02:00:10.145Z", "content": "India\u2019s government is under pressure to\u2009turn around a slowing economy but with little room to manoeuvre as it prepares to present one of the most consequential budgets since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power more than a decade ago.\n\nFinance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is facing expectations to announce tax cuts, new capital expenditure and reforms to India\u2019s regulatory regime when she unveils the first full budget of Modi\u2019s third term on Saturday.\n\nBut her ability to revive an economy mired in a broad slowdown \u2014 and allay discontent among the ruling Bharatiya Janata party\u2019s middle- and upper-class political base \u2014 may be limited.\n\nIndia\u2019s pace of growth, while still the fastest among large economies, is heading for a post-pandemic low, dragged down by weaker urban consumption, persistent food inflation, stagnant wage and job growth and sluggish private sector investment.\n\nSecond-quarter fiscal year growth, the most recent reported, was 5.4 per cent, the slowest pace in nearly two years, and the central bank downgraded growth forecasts for the 2024-25 fiscal year.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of pressures \u2014 there has been a cyclical slowdown,\u201d said Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist with GlobalData.TSLombard. \u201cWe have to see whether they will stick with that fiscal discipline they have exhibited over the past few years\u201d, or \u201cdo more on welfare spending\u201d.\n\nNew Delhi recently named Sanjay Malhotra, a former revenue secretary, as Reserve Bank of India governor, a move markets saw as both a changing of the guard and a commitment to the government\u2019s recent record of stronger growth and fiscal rectitude.\n\nIndia\u2019s fiscal deficit is below 5 per cent of GDP and falling, and the government resisted the temptation to unleash populist spending measures in last year\u2019s post-election budget plan, which followed a nationwide poll in which the BJP lost its parliamentary majority.\n\n\u201cThis is a finance ministry that values prudence,\u201d said Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, which expects weaker growth in the first half of this year before a gradual recovery. \u201cA big stimulus package looks unlikely.\u201d\n\nHowever, Shah added that boosting spending on infrastructure \u2014 a hallmark of Modi\u2019s tenure \u2014 \u201cwould help to support economic activity in the near term while also lifting the economy\u2019s medium-term supply potential\u201d.\n\nSpending is already rising in some states, including Maharashtra and Karnataka, where the BJP and opposition rivals are vying to outdo one another with politically driven, open-ended welfare spending promises, pushing the country\u2019s consolidated budget deficit close to 8 per cent of GDP. Local elections are also looming this year in Delhi and Bihar, India\u2019s third-largest state.\n\nWorking in India\u2019s favour, economists expect the country\u2019s inward-focused economy to avoid the brunt of Donald Trump\u2019s expected barrage of tariffs on countries such as China. In a call this week, the US president urged his Indian counterpart to buy more American-made weapons, and Trump later said Modi would probably visit the White House in February.\n\nThe finance minister\u2019s budget address will be followed less than a week later by the RBI\u2019s first monetary policy decision under Malhotra, who replaced the more hawkish Shaktikanta Das.\n\nMalhotra has been facing calls to cut rates from powerful Modi allies, including finance minister Sitharaman and commerce minister Piyush Goyal, who favour lower borrowing costs to support growth, despite inflation that remains close to the top of the central bank\u2019s 4-6 per cent target band.\n\nMany economists expect the RBI to begin easing rates from its current 6.5 per cent level, particularly after it announced measures this week amounting to a near $18bn liquidity infusion in the cash-starved banking sector.\n\nBut Kunal Kundu, India economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, cautioned that the economic vulnerabilities were structural, rather than transitory. He said fundamental shifts, including a focus on education and healthcare investment, were needed for India to create more formal jobs for its huge and under-skilled labour force.\n\n\u201cEmployment and wages remain at the heart of the slowdown,\u201d said Kundu. \u201cWhat\u2019s required is not rocket science: basically, you have to have policies that eventually enable more job generation.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/47fb4c5e-718c-403a-908c-bb490d1516ce"}, {"uuid4": "433a03d9-fc86-4323-acc6-7bd987c5ada7", "title": "Police say 30 killed in stampede at Indian religious festival ", "description": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi offers condolences to families of \u2018pious souls\u2019 lost in tragedy at Hindu Kumbh Mela gathering ", "author": "Jyotsna Singh", "published_date": "2025-01-29T13:49:55.616Z", "content": "Police have said 30 people died in a crush at a Hindu festival in northern India, where millions have gathered for what is considered to be the world\u2019s largest religious event.\n\nVaibhav Krishna, the deputy inspector general of police for the festival, told a press conference that a further 60 people were injured in the stampede at the Kumbh Mela in Uttar Pradesh state in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\n\nKrishna said \u201cthree or four\u201d barriers leading to the confluence of the Yamuna and Ganges rivers had collapsed and that many of the devotees who were killed had been sleeping before they were trampled on.\n\nEmergency services were deployed to the scene and injured pilgrims were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. Local media broadcast images from the scene showed what appeared to be bodies being taken away. Many of those injured were reported to be in critical condition.\n\n\u201cWe were a group of 10 people, but now only two of us women are left,\u201d one witness told domestic news channel ABP News. \u201cOne person was trampled to death right in front of us.

Fatalities have occurred in previous years.\n\nSpeaking at a public rally in Delhi, Modi described the accident as \u201ca tragedy\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have lost some pious souls, many have been injured.

Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Brics countries, a grouping of major emerging economies that includes India.\n\nIn a social media post late on Monday, Modi called Trump a \u201cdear friend\u201d and said they were \u201ccommitted to a mutually beneficial and trusted partnership\u201d in several areas, including security.\n\nTrump later told reporters that Modi would visit the White House \u201cprobably in February\u201d, which would make the Indian leader among the first foreign dignitaries to visit since the US president\u2019s inauguration.\n\nTrump\u2019s requests came as India, long the world\u2019s largest arms importer, has been seeking to diversify its weapons suppliers beyond Russia. It has leaned on the US, along with other countries such as France, to close a gap in military technology and preparedness with regional rival China.\n\nModi has also pushed India\u2019s military to support domestic arms manufacturers, part of his ambition for the defence and aviation industries to help make the country a global manufacturing power. Modi has set a target of $35bn for domestic defence production by the end of the decade,\u00a0up from nearly $20bn last year.\n\nNew Delhi needs to upgrade its military capabilities if it is to match those of nuclear-armed neighbour China, according to analysts, including in fighter jets, submarines, tanks, helicopters and even assault rifles. While some domestic arms makers have such capabilities, India lacks critical knowhow for technologies such as military jet engines.\n\nTrump and Modi also discussed expanding security co-operation in the Indo-Pacific region and reiterated their commitment to the Quad \u2014 a strategic grouping that also includes Japan and Australia \u2014 according to the White House. India is set to host the group\u2019s leaders this year.\n\nThe call coincided with a visit by India\u2019s foreign secretary Vikram Misri to Beijing on Tuesday, during which the countries agreed\u00a0in principle to resume direct passenger flights for the first time in five years. The routes were initially suspended during the Covid pandemic, and remained so after deadly border clashes in 2020 soured relations.\n\nTrump said he and Modi also discussed immigration, a priority for the new US administration, adding that the Indian prime minister would \u201cdo what\u2019s right\u201d in terms of accepting the return of illegal Indian nationals from the US.\n\nIndians made up the third-largest group of unauthorised immigrants in the US in 2022 after Mexico and El Salvador, according to the Pew Research Center.", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a33cdadb-5e09-4dd1-a9be-f995466338b6"}, {"uuid4": "977662cf-dc9c-4aaa-b411-5e348fa969d5", "title": "How Pakistan\u2019s military is taking over its economy", "description": "The country\u2019s armed forces have become intimately involved in everything from canal projects to energy contracts. Investors are increasingly nervous", "author": "Janina Conboye", "published_date": "2025-01-28T05:00:37.637Z", "content": "On a sunny early January afternoon, two thousand fishermen, farmers and activists gathered on the dry river bed outside Kotri Barrage in Pakistan, the final dam before the waters of the Indus flow into the Arabian Sea.\n\n\u201cSend this message to Islamabad, send this message to Pindi: we will not drink your gutter water!\u201d shouted one activist, referring to Rawalpindi, where the army is headquartered. \u201cWe reject the canal!\u201d roared the crowd.\n\nThe protests were against a Rs200bn ($720mn) project to build canals that would divert water upstream to eastern Pakistan. There, an agricultural company led by the military, Green Pakistan, hopes to turn a large swath of desert into fertile farmland that will guarantee a steady supply of grain and attract investment from Gulf states.\n\nThe canal project is being directed by the government, but led by the Special Investment Facilitation Council, an investment body co-led by Asim Munir, Pakistan\u2019s army chief of staff. Other SIFC initiatives, led mostly by serving and retired officers, include plans to renovate hotels at the foot of the snowcapped peaks in Pakistan\u2019s north and schemes to exploit mineral and natural gas riches in the mountainous frontier with Afghanistan.\n\nProponents say the army\u2019s role is crucial in projects like this: as well as cutting through red tape and settling the squabbles that have prevented Pakistan from developing export and tourism sectors, it can draw in much-needed foreign investment and reshape one of Asia\u2019s most troubled economies.\n\nThe army has always had an outsized role in Pakistani politics. No fewer than four military dictators have ruled the country since independence in 1947\u00a0\u2014 most recently Pervez Musharraf, who was ejected from power in 2008. Even when civilian governments have been in power, there is widespread evidence that army chiefs have held considerable sway.\n\nAnalysts and officials say that the military\u2019s influence over the country\u2019s civilian government is at its highest level since Musharraf\u2019s resignation.\n\nBut in recent years especially, the tentacles of the military have extended even further, deep into Pakistan\u2019s economy. A 2021 UN report described military-linked businesses as the \u201clargest conglomerate in Pakistan\u201d. And at the launch of Pakistan\u2019s new five-year economic plan on New Year\u2019s eve, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly thanked chief of staff Munir for helping save the country from the brink of default in June 2023.\n\n\u201cI must tell you, without any fear of any kind of exaggeration, that I\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009never experienced this kind of co-operation which I\u2019ve received from the army chief and the institution,\u201d he told the audience.\n\nCritics warn that the military\u2019s ever-expanding economic footprint raises the risk that it will favour its own interests over others.\u00a0There are also concerns that its involvement in politics and the economy is distracting it from counterterrorism work, increasing societal unrest and deterring foreign investment.\n\nThe military\u2019s presence also offers acute challenges for the political factions that govern this country of 240mn people. The Pakistan People\u2019s party is the third-largest party in Islamabad and the ruling party in Sindh \u2014 a province of 50mn people where there is widespread opposition to the canal project.\n\nThe party can either resist \u201cor sell out, letting other, more violent and nationalist forces step in\u201d, says Naveed Qamar, one of its senior members of the national parliament. \u201cWe could see our support completely collapse in Sindh.\u201d\n\nMunir has leaned into the army\u2019s \u201csaviour complex\u201d, says Madiha Afzal, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. The military has come to believe \u201cthat it alone can fix Pakistan, that it alone can guarantee the political stability needed for economic progress and can ensure that the economic ship is righted,\u201d she adds.\n\nPakistan\u2019s military leaders began ramping up their involvement in economic matters around the time of Imran Khan\u2019s ascent to power in 2018. Amid an economic slowdown and the accelerating growth of its great rival, India, the military played a prominent role in Khan\u2019s rise.\n\nBut the former prime minister fell out with the top brass, and generals grew more sceptical that electoral democracy could deliver growth, enable Pakistan to compete with India or serve the army\u2019s own widespread political and business interests, analysts and former officials say.\n\nThe need for a rethink became more acute as Pakistan\u2019s importance to the outside world waned. \u201cTen years ago, the US was in Afghanistan, so Pakistan\u2019s geopolitical position was secure,\u201d says Stefan Dercon, a professor at Oxford who has advised Sharif on economic reform. \u201cThey could expect to be seen as too big to fail.\u201d\n\nCounting on waivers and bailouts from friendly countries worried that its collapse might put nuclear weapons within the reach of Islamist terror groups, Pakistan put off serious structural reforms. \u201cIt was an overdraft without ever needing to be called in,\u201d says Dercon. \u201cThat\u2019s changed now.\u201d\n\nWhen Munir became chief of the army staff in November 2022, seven months after Khan was ousted and replaced by Sharif, the country was still haemorrhaging dollar reserves, inflation was rocketing and insurgencies were starting to flare up along the Afghanistan border.\n\nSince then, the general has made saving the economy a core part of his public image.\u00a0Last November, he told a group of businessmen in Karachi that \u201call indicators of Pakistan\u2019s economy are positive\u201d, according to a report by the state news agency. \u201cWhere are the people now who spread disappointment and talked about default?\u201d he added.\n\nMunir has secured an extension to his term, potentially allowing him to stay in office for 10 years rather than the usual maximum of six.\n\nPakistan\u2019s elected government now comprises an alliance of parties whose leaders have all fallen foul of the army in the past, but have united to prevent Khan \u2014 whose allies won the most votes in last February\u2019s contested election \u2014 from returning to power.\n\nWith Khan in prison, the government wants to use its time in power to pursue ambitious reforms that ministers say will transform Pakistan\u2019s boom-and-bust economy.\n\nTheir close ties to the army, they say, insulate them from the feuds and public backlashes that have prevented past prime ministers from completing full terms.\n\n\u201cThere is a broad understanding between all pillars of state that any political uncertainty and political instability would be suicidal for Pakistan,\u201d says planning minister Ahsan Iqbal. \u201cThere is very good positive synergy\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009between the establishment [a common euphemism for the military] and the government to take this economic recovery path together,\u201d he tells the Financial Times.\n\nIn addition to Munir sitting atop the SIFC, alongside the prime minister, serving generals also run Pakistan\u2019s national population registry, its anti-corruption watchdog and task forces pursuing tax reform and the renegotiation of energy contracts.\n\nMunir also directed a 2023 operation against currency smuggling, while admirers also cite his ties to the Gulf monarchies that Pakistan depends upon for financing.\n\nOne senior government official acknowledges that \u201cthere has definitely been mission creep\u201d, but blames politicians: \u201cWe failed to take the steps we should have taken before to fix the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The army] acts as a nudge to get us to tax our voter bank, or right-size the government,\u201d the official adds. \u201cThey see themselves as guardrails for the economic reform journey.\u201d\n\nIn the 18 months since Pakistan\u2019s near-default, the country has returned to a semblance of economic stability. In September, it secured a $7bn IMF bailout and inflation fell to 4.1 per cent in December \u2014 having peaked at 38 per cent in June 2023. The central bank has cut interest rates and has enough dollar reserves to cover over two months of imports.\n\nTo shore up its finances and retain IMF support, Pakistan\u2019s government raised taxes on salaried workers, removed popular energy subsidies and promised to introduce taxes on the politically sensitive agriculture and real estate sectors. It has also said it would slash trade tariffs by a third over three years.\n\nBut the country\u2019s economy is still growing more slowly than its population, with a million more people entering the workforce each year than there are formal jobs. \u201cGrowth is still very low,\u201d says Hasnain Malik, head of equity and investment strategy at emerging and frontier market research company Tellimer.\n\n\u201cThe huge devaluation of the currency has left its scars on consumption power without yet triggering an export boom, and external debt refinancing needs are still very high.\u201d\n\nIn mid-January, a group of Pakistani wind energy executives sat down in a conference room in a military base in Rawalpindi.\n\nAccording to two of those present, a team of bureaucrats flanked by half a dozen uniformed army officers demanded that they revise the state-backed contracts they had signed years before \u2014 changes the government says would bring down electricity prices for ordinary people.\n\nOne of the executives says they were informed by a bureaucrat that \u201cif you do not want to work with us, we will let the right people get in touch\u201d \u2014 meaning one of the officers behind him.\n\n\u201cThe message was clear,\u201d says the executive, who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cWe will probably need to shut down our wind farm in Sindh to avoid going into default now.\u201d\n\nThe episode was the one of several negotiations with power producers that Pakistani authorities, with the support of the security services, have undertaken since August.\n\nNadeem Anjum, the then head of Inter-Services Intelligence, Pakistan\u2019s foreign spy agency, also met energy executives towards the end of 2024 to discuss renegotiating power contracts.\n\nA decade ago, Pakistan attracted heavy foreign investment in its power sector by promising dollar-indexed, state-guaranteed returns. But the recent surge in electricity prices has turned such investors into public villains.\n\nSharif has celebrated these renegotiations as proof that his government will take bold steps to bring down power bills. But they have unnerved the business community and foreign investors, according to seven energy sector executives who shared details with the Financial Times.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t lawyer up and go to arbitration \u2014 we have to live and do business in this country,\u201d complains another energy executive who had his contract terminated last year.\n\nA Ministry of Power spokesperson says the ongoing renegotiations \u201cwill be according to law and with mutual agreement as in the past\u201d.\n\nA letter sent by the German embassy to Munir in October, and seen by the FT, questioned the \u201cunusual manner\u201d in which negotiations over Rousch Power, a company in which a unit of German engineering giant Siemens held a significant stake, were being conducted. It went on to warn that the affair was \u201calready damaging the trust of German enterprises and investors\u201d.\n\nSiemens confirmed that Pakistan\u2019s government had asked to renegotiate the power contracts but did not comment on the contents of the letter. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry offered no comment either.\n\nCritics say that these disputes are hindering Islamabad\u2019s efforts to pursue other reforms, such as the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines. One businessman, who also asked for anonymity, says that having his company\u2019s power contract terminated had forced him to pull out of talks about the airline.\n\nTwo other investors say their participation in a second round of bidding for PIA will depend on the government protecting their stakes in the airline. They also say that they plan to reach out to Fauji Foundation, a conglomerate linked to the military, to join their consortium \u201cas an insurance policy\u201d.\n\nWhile a loss of external investment could yet create an incentive for reform, Ahmed Pirzada, a senior lecturer at the University of Bristol, says there is also \u201ca risk that the country\u2019s elites will respond by consolidating their control over resources, effectively grabbing a larger share of a shrinking economic pie to maintain their lifestyles\u201d.\n\nAzeema Cheema, a director at Verso Consulting, adds that the government\u2019s unpopularity incentivises it \u201cto stick to the few friends it has left, instead of governing for the public at large\u201d.\n\nLast year\u2019s budget was peppered with pork-barrel spending and tax breaks, with legislators, bureaucrats and serving and retired military officers among the main beneficiaries.\u00a0\u201cThe whole idea becomes spend, spend, spend on initiatives that\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. serve only to appease their household guards,\u201d adds Cheema.\n\nPakistan\u2019s military has also launched a broad-based crackdown against political opponents. Thousands of members of Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party have been taken to anti-terrorism and military courts, while many senior leaders have gone into hiding.\n\nThe detentions have drawn criticism from abroad, with the EU warning in late December that military trials for civilians were inconsistent with commitments Pakistan had made to gain access to a preferential trade agreement that has been a lifeline to its textile sector.\n\nSince last year, protests like those in Sindh have erupted throughout the country. Demonstrators calling for Khan\u2019s release clashed with police in Islamabad and others in Balochistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir staged sit-ins and strikes over crackdowns on civil rights.\n\nGovernment and military officials say a muscular approach is needed to defeat terrorism and ensure the political stability necessary for investors to feel safe. But they have denied that their actions violate Pakistan\u2019s constitution, and insist the military does not participate in politics.\n\nThe Pakistan Armed Forces and SIFC did not reply to repeated requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, critics warn that public disaffection with the government is only increasing. They point to increasingly brutal insurgencies that last year led to more than 2,000 deaths in the western provinces where Pakistan is keen on tapping into mineral and gas reserves.\n\nIn Balochistan, \u201cit is hard to find a single family that does not have someone missing or killed\u201d, says Mahvish Ahmad, a professor in human rights and politics at the London School of Economics. The province is home to a Chinese-backed port, Gwadar, and Pakistan hopes to develop a giant copper mine there.\n\nSharif\u2019s coalition has also sought to tighten its grip over the internet and social media, claiming that misinformation is undermining public faith in the government and the armed forces.\n\nKalsoom Lakhani, the co-founder of i2i Ventures, a Pakistan-focused venture capital firm, says throttling the internet \u201cacts as a ceiling on the Pakistani start-up space and commerce as a whole\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe arbitrariness of all of it also adds to overall uncertainty,\u201d she adds, scaring investors away from an industry that contributed over $3bn in export earnings last year.\n\nAfzal, of the Brookings Institution, says the military \u201csees political repression as generating political stability, which is needed for economic stability\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut that political stability comes via cementing its own hold on power, with a politically subservient civilian government nominally in charge,\u201d she adds. \u201cPakistan\u2019s democracy looks worse now than at any point since 2008.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Chris Kay in Mumbai and Patricia Nilsson in Frankfurt\n\nData visualisation by Janina Conboye", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f3dae073-c158-43e2-a8c6-628acc46a868"}, {"uuid4": "abcd2c99-2ae6-4892-8bc2-5093b8eb937e", "title": "India's banking sector slump", "description": "Also in this newsletter: China is building the world\u2019s largest dam and Ashish Gupta\u2019s mantra", "author": "Veena Venugopal", "published_date": "2025-01-28T01:30:36.152Z", "content": "Good morning. India\u2019s stock markets started yet another week in deep red, as quarterly results of big companies provided little cheer. Saturday\u2019s budget announcements will determine where the markets go next.\n\nIn today\u2019s newsletter, we take a look at the performance of the banking sector and what that says about the economy. Plus, India is alarmed by China\u2019s plans to build the world\u2019s largest dam in Tibet.\n\nIndia\u2019s banking sector is having a difficult year, with rising bad debts and a weak outlook for credit growth. The quarterly earnings of major private banks, which were announced this month, show a larger number of customers defaulting on the interest payment of their loans. These defaults are highest in the unsecured loans category \u2014 credit cards and personal loans.\n\nAmitabh Chaudhry, chief executive of Axis Bank, said it was a \u201ctough environment\u201d and expected both deposit and credit growth to be subdued until 2026. HDFC Bank, the country\u2019s largest private lender by market capitalisation, reported a 17 per cent rise in provisions (money set aside to cover potential bad loans), a sign it is preparing for higher defaults in the future. ICICI Bank, which announced its results on Friday, offered better news overall but it, too, saw its provisions rise.\n\nTogether with the results of consumer goods companies, which are witnessing slowing demand especially in urban areas, these numbers illustrate the real troubles in the economy. Rising inflation has forced the Reserve Bank of India to keep interest rates high, leading to significant slowdowns in consumption and credit growth. The government this month revised down its GDP growth forecast for the year starting in April to 6.4 per cent.\n\nIn a surprise move yesterday, the central bank announced three measures to inject liquidity into the banking system. These included open market purchase auctions of government securities, a variable rate repo auction (where the central bank allows banks to borrow at a variable interest rate, which is determined through an auction), and a foreign exchange swap where the RBI buys US dollars from banks and strikes a deal to sell them at a later date.\n\nThis sets the scene for Saturday, when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to announce her budget proposals in parliament. My hope is that she will produce some more magic to break the deadlock of high interest rates and weaker GDP growth that has lately plagued the economy.\n\nHave questions about the budget?

The 60-gigawatt project is three times the size of China\u2019s Three Gorges, which is currently the world\u2019s largest hydropower facility, and could cost $137bn. The proposed dam is on the Yarlung Tsangpo river, the Tibetan name for the Brahmaputra, and lies close to Arunachal Pradesh. India\u2019s worries are related to security as well the ecological repercussions of this construction. The dam will give China the power to control water supply to Arunachal Pradesh, including the ability to flood parts of the state. It will also probably change the flow of the river and have an impact on the availability of water downstream even during peacetime.\n\nIndia\u2019s concerns also underline the uneasy relationship between the two large neighbours. After four years of tensions along the Line of Actual Control, in October 2024 the two countries reached a deal to de-escalate the military stand-off. Subsequently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met China\u2019s President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Russia for their first bilateral meeting in five years. Both countries have since withdrawn tens of thousands of troops from the region.\n\nBut the dam sets up the prospect of intensifying competition over water resources between the two nations. India has announced plans to build what would be the subcontinent\u2019s largest dam, the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project, in Arunachal Pradesh. (Caught between the two is the smaller Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, which too has built several medium-sized dams on the same river.) That there will be a significant ecological impact from this is a given, even if China is promoting it as an environmentally-friendly sustainable source of electricity. India is right to be concerned about the strategic edge the dam gives China, but it has limited options to counter the threat.\n\nGlobal investors made the best use of booming secondary markets and offloaded a record amount of private equity stakes in 2024\n\nEach week, we invite a top Indian business leader to tell us their mantra for work and life.

Last October, New Delhi and Beijing reached a deal to resolve a military stand-off and agreed to military patrols along their disputed Himalayan border.\n\nIndia fears that the dam, located in seismic Tibet, could spur floods and water scarcity downstream, while giving China the upper hand in any potential stand-off between the nuclear-armed neighbours, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThere are fears of all kinds,\u201d said Shivshankar Menon, India\u2019s former national security adviser and chair of the Ashoka Centre for China Studies. \u201cThe geopolitics don\u2019t help, obviously, because nobody trusts anybody in this.\u201d\n\nTibet has a third of China\u2019s hydroelectric power potential. The Yarlung Tsangpo \u2014 the world\u2019s highest major waterway \u2014 is Tibet\u2019s longest river, and is called Brahmaputra in India before it turns into the Jamuna in Bangladesh.\n\nThe 60-gigawatt dam on the Tibetan plateau\u2019s rim lies near the border with the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, the eastern tip of India over which Beijing claims sovereignty and the two sides fought a war in 1962.\n\n\u201cIndia and Bangladesh are concerned that the dam would change the river\u2019s natural flow, which could disrupt access to water for agriculture, drinking and other essential human needs,\u201d said Neeraj Singh Manhas, an expert on transboundary rivers and water security in south Asia.\n\nBarry Sautman, a political scientist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said China could argue, however, that Tibet was not the main source of water for the Brahmaputra. \u201cSomewhere between 7 per cent and 30 per cent of the water comes from Tibet. The rest comes from rainfall [downstream],\u201d said Sautman.\n\nWhen it formally announced the dam on Christmas Day, Beijing said it would \u201cbring more sense of gain, happiness and security to the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet\u201d.\n\nChinese officials have dismissed concerns about the impact on environmental or downriver water supplies.\u00a0\u201cThe project will not have a negative impact on the ecological environment, geological conditions and the rights and interests related to water resources of downstream countries,\u201d said China\u2019s foreign ministry\u2019s spokesperson Guo Jiakun.\n\nActivists allege that the 193 hydropower projects built in Tibet since 2000 have led to serious environmental and human rights violations. China\u2019s extensive dam-building projects in Tibet have previously attracted fierce opposition, such as around the Kamtok, or Gangtuo, hydroelectric power plant on the eastern Jinsha river.\n\n\u201cWe are anticipating there would be a huge negative impact,\u201d said Malik Fida Khan, executive director of Bangladesh\u2019s Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services, a government research centre.\n\nIndia is also planning to build what would be the subcontinent\u2019s largest dam, the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project, with an output capacity of 11GW in Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nPema Khandu, chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, told Indian news agency PTI that this dam was aimed at \u201cmitigating potential flood risks from water releases\u201d because China was \u201cunpredictable and can do anything\u201d.\n\nIndia\u2019s dam project has also ignited opposition from local populations and concerns in Bangladesh.\n\nAdditional reporting by Nian Liu in Beijing, cartography by Steven Bernard and data visualisation by Bob Haslett", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3d1a4333-57e9-4e04-b144-882ca3e7fab7"}, {"uuid4": "6c65bcb5-389d-422c-84e9-cedd6af18e41", "title": "Lessons from ancient India on post-conflict reconstruction ", "description": "Peace engineering is difficult to measure but critical to do", "author": "Guru Madhavan", "published_date": "2025-01-26T05:00:51.454Z", "content": "The writer is a biomedical systems engineer and author of \u2018Wicked Problems: How to Engineer a Better World\u2019\n\nAncient India\u2019s greatest engineering achievement wasn\u2019t a monument but a metamorphosis. When Emperor Ashoka, who ruled most of the Indian subcontinent in the third century BCE, saw the carnage he wrought in the Kalinga war \u2014 over 100,000 dead \u2014 he redirected his empire\u2019s technical prowess from combat to community. Modern conflict zones everywhere, from Sudan to Myanmar, Gaza to Ukraine, await a similar transformation.\n\nAshoka\u2019s infrastructure once forged dominance over an area that spanned Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Siege engines demolished defences, roads propelled armies, fortifications constrained movement and ports dictated trade. After his moral awakening, however, military roads became pilgrimage paths dotted with wells and rest houses; barriers transformed into trading posts. His edicts, carved into mountainsides, proclaimed a radical vision: infrastructure should be a tool for social cohesion rather than control.\n\nThis vision resonates in modern history. The postwar reconstruction Marshall Plan rewove western Europe\u2019s fractured landscape through roads, power grids and industries, fostering social recovery. Japan\u2019s bullet train Shinkansen was more than a railway \u2014 it marked a shift from wartime priorities to economic integration and national connectivity. Post-cold war Germany turned former checkpoints like Berlin\u2019s Potsdamer Platz into social hubs of reunification. Northern Ireland\u2019s Peace Bridge spanned decades of sectarian divide, symbolising reconciliation. In Rwanda and Sri Lanka, community centres and reopened highways like the A-9 mended societies torn apart by genocide and civil war. These examples affirm Ashoka\u2019s insight: infrastructure can unite or divide, depending on its design.\n\nBut centring peace in engineering also confronts stark realities. Billions of dollars flow into military machinery while peace-building efforts scrape by. Businesses prioritise proxies of power \u2014 price and speed \u2014 over reducing conflict risks. Harmony and stability can feel like unaffordable luxuries.\n\nReconstruction is sometimes less about materials available than about power \u2014 who controls, who benefits, and whose version of history prevails. Technical neutrality is a profitable \u2014 and pernicious \u2014 myth. These constraints expose a deeper predicament. Defence contracts offer clean metrics and measurable outcomes but peace resists such quantification. Like public health or preventive maintenance, its benefits can be hard to evaluate. Without ways to review and reward it, even visionary engineers may find it difficult to justify spending money.\n\nThere is also the need to find agreed upon standards \u2014 each tied to clear metrics and mandates. Safety engineering progressed through structural load limits and fire codes, giving tangible form to abstract risks. Environmental engineering advanced through emissions standards and related safeguards, making invisible threats visible. Peace engineering requires similar discipline \u2014 methods to gauge the results of infrastructure choices.\n\nIn Iraq\u2019s 2003 reconstruction, standard technical metrics showed restored infrastructure exceeding prewar electrical capacity. But this masked a more complicated reality. Years of conflict and sanctions had cultivated decentralised networks. Unreliable central grids had taught Baghdad\u2019s residents to rely on local generators \u2014 adaptive solutions that persisted even after centralised systems returned. This divergence between technical success and lived experience underscores a critical insight: successful infrastructure requires an understanding of those who will use it. Designing infrastructure like transportation networks isn\u2019t simply solving technical puzzles \u2014 it determines how communities interact long into the future. This requires evaluation conducted with the same rigour as structural integrity or environmental protection.\n\nIn peacetime, engineering firms already balance complex risks and competing priorities. Analysing infrastructure\u2019s social effects as well isn\u2019t mission creep \u2014 it\u2019s essential wisdom. This is an important lesson to remember as Ukraine works to rebuild its power grids and Gaza reconstructs its water systems.\n\nEngineering shaped Ashoka\u2019s empire twice: first as an instrument of conquest, then as a foundation for peace. Two millennia later, his transformation highlights an elemental truth: peace isn\u2019t an ideal to contemplate but a structure to make and maintain.", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/62fc4b16-85b3-4d3c-b898-7604833aba24"}, {"uuid4": "70132c66-ba8d-4020-bd4e-c24bceb44987", "title": "Indian jewellers build on diaspora to break into western markets", "description": "Cities such as London and New York have become springboards to reach buyers looking for cultural authenticity", "author": "Milena Lazazzera", "published_date": "2025-01-24T04:00:56.519Z", "content": "When Viren Bhagat announced plans to set up shop in London, he joined a growing number of Indian jewellers expanding into western markets, where the vast majority of the country\u2019s diaspora live.\n\nBhagat started to increase his exposure outside India through his participation in Tefaf, the European Fine Art Foundation fair held annually in Maastricht and New York. Most recently, his work gained attention when Nita Ambani (pictured above), the wife of Asia\u2019s richest tycoon Mukesh Ambani, wore a striking set of his jewellery \u2014 comprising a headpiece, necklace, armlet, two cuffs and a ring, all adorned with larger-than-life emeralds \u2014 at the highly publicised and lavish wedding of her son, Anant Ambani.\n\nIndia has a long-standing tradition of crafting jewellery and cutting and polishing gemstones \u2014 90 per cent of the world\u2019s rough diamonds are processed in the country.\n\nIdiosyncratic cultural practices also set the country apart. For instance, engagement and wedding ceremonies involve exchanging gold jewellery, including a \u201cmangalsutra\u201d necklace for the bride and a bracelet for the groom; although the giving of an engagement ring ahead of a ceremony is rare. On festive occasions, jewellery sets are worn, and deemed incomplete without headpieces, armlets and anklets.\n\nWhile such traditions have historically hindered the expansion of western jewellers in India, they have contributed to the growth of local talents and supported their expansion abroad \u2014 as Indians living outside the country seek to uphold their customs.\n\n\u201cAt first, the Indian diaspora made up a significant portion of our clientele, as they already knew the brand and trusted its quality,\u201d recalls Sabyasachi Mukherjee, founder of Sabyasachi, one of the first Indian luxury brands to establish a retail presence at department stores Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue in New York, in 2020.\n\nIn 2023, the brand then brought its jewellery to a British audience by showcasing pieces at London\u2019s Lancaster House and participating in the charitable Animal Ball, organised by wildlife charity Elephant Family and indigenous peoples initiative the Tintra Foundation. The event was attended by King Charles and Queen Camilla, who both wore traditional Shola masks designed by Sabyasachi.\n\n\u201cBranching out into the west was a natural progression in our quest to become India\u2019s first global luxury brand,\u201d says Mukherjee. \u201cThe understanding and consumption of jewellery is universal \u2014 it is the most accessible category to introduce India\u2019s traditions of craft, quality and authenticity. The west has always admired the richness of our culture, and I saw a unique opportunity to introduce an Indian voice to the global luxury market.\u201d\n\nThe growing global interest in Bollywood cinema and its stars, such as Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra \u2014 brand ambassadors for Cartier and Bvlgari, respectively \u2014 has drawn the attention of western audiences. Also, global luxury brands, such as Cartier, organise ad hoc events to celebrate the Indian Diwali festival, underscoring the growing influence of Indian creativity abroad.\n\n\u201cOver time, our customer base has diversified,\u201d says Mukherjee. \u201cToday, our western clients include individuals who value cultural authenticity, unique designs, and impeccable craftsmanship. Our jewellery resonates with collectors, art enthusiasts, and fashion lovers who appreciate the story behind each piece. Hollywood celebrities and international stylists have also embraced our work, helping us reach audiences far beyond the diaspora.\u201d\n\nWhile Sabyasachi\u2019s designs remain distinctively Indian, a new wave of Indian creators have purposefully expanded abroad to break free from traditional aesthetics. They are targeting a public receptive to new motifs that, while informed by Indian heritage, are not immediately attributable to that particular culture.\n\nThis has been the case for Ananya Malhotra, founder of Ananya, who, by opening a showroom in London in 2022, has found a suitable audience and accelerated her brand\u2019s growth. Ananya\u2019s use of colourful gemstones and designs that reinterpret Indian traditions, such as the chakra bracelet, with a refreshing contemporary twist has gained favour with an international clientele, even beyond the UK. \u201cLondon is a melting pot for so many cultures; it really offers a unique, wholesome exposure for a brand,\u201d she says.\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Karina Choudhrie, who opened her first office in the UK in 2010 and an atelier seven years ago. Choudhrie has seen her business grow rapidly, attracting clients beyond the millions of Indians forming the diaspora and local British buyers. \u201cWe have had clients from Brazil, [North] America, Europe, and Asia,\u201d she says. \u201cLondon has been the perfect base for us and we have seen the business progress organically, largely by word of mouth.\u201d\n\nOutposts in Dubai and New Delhi have allowed her to navigate the challenges posed by Brexit and the removal of VAT refunds for tourists. \u201cWe manufacture in Valenza, Italy, and Jaipur, India, and have offices in Dubai, London, and New Delhi,\u201d Choudhrie explains. \u201cBefore Brexit, we could get deliveries much faster. However, since Brexit, the process has become significantly slower.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the inability of tourists to claim back the 20 per cent VAT has had a noticeable effect on our business in London.

Has it only been four days since Trump\u2019s inauguration? It\u2019s going to take me a while to get used to waking up to a whole bunch of head-spinning new developments every day.\n\nCloser to home, Saturday February 1 is Budget day. Do you have any questions? Send them to us and we\u2019ll answer them the week after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announces her plans for the year.\n\nIn today\u2019s newsletter, we look at Hindustan Unilever\u2019s acquisition of homegrown skincare brand Minimalist, a mouthwatering prospect for other direct-to-customer brands. But first, the big fight. It\u2019s restaurants versus Swiggy and Zomato.\n\nThe delivery person is taking over the kitchen. The already uneasy relationship between restaurants and food delivery apps has now taken a turn for the worse, with the launch of Swiggy\u2019s Snacc and Zomato-owned Blinkit\u2019s Bistro. These standalone apps from the two popular delivery platforms promise to deliver meals, snacks and beverages in under 15 minutes. How is it different from regular Swiggy and Zomato, you ask? The platforms have effectively taken restaurants out of the equation; the food is sourced from so-called \u201cdark\u201d kitchens.\n\nThe association of restaurant owners is up in arms. They are evaluating legal options, as well as adding this to a complaint they have already registered with the competition commission. Their contention is that Swiggy and Zomato have access to all the data and this can be used to predict customer preferences and run a more efficient operation, putting traditional eateries at a disadvantage. The new apps will also be able to dynamically price their samosas and biryani.\n\nTheir angst is understandable. Restaurants are in a tough position \u2014 they can neither live with Swiggy and Zomato nor can they live without them. The food delivery companies\u2019 massive fleets give restaurants access to a much larger base of customers but cut into their margins, charging platform fees and placing tremendous pressure on restaurants to extend offers and discounts. Even if a restaurant invests in its own delivery service, customers are now so comfortable with these platforms that it is difficult to get them to change their behaviour and order directly. What was seen as a blessing for the industry during the pandemic has now become an existential threat.\n\nParadoxically, food delivery platforms, too, are finding it tough going. Zomato, which announced its quarterly results earlier this week, reported a slowdown in the gross order value of its food delivery business. This is the total value of all orders before cancellations, refunds etc. Its stock has fallen nearly 20 per cent since, and shares in rival Swiggy have dropped 9 per cent this week too.\n\nIn a letter to restaurant partners last week, Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal wrote that his goal for Bistro was to find a workable model that the restaurant industry can replicate. I am not sure what comfort restaurants can take in this. There is no denying that Swiggy and Zomato have had significant impact in changing urban lives (not to mention the ubiquitous presence of orange and red riders on our streets), but much of this was fuelled by venture capitalist money racing for customer acquisition. Now that the discounts are drying up, customers are going back to the simpler (and healthier) pleasures of home-cooked meals.\n\nHave you cut down on Swiggy/Zomato orders? (I have). Write to me at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply.\n\nHindustan Unilever\u2019s Rs30bn ($345mn) acquisition of skincare brand Minimalist is a shot in the arm for homegrown brands started mostly by young entrepreneurs who use the power of social media to sell directly to customers. Minimalist was founded five years ago by two brothers, Rahul and Mohit Yadav. The Jaipur-based duo launched a series of serums to help alleviate skincare concerns, but they ran a tight ship and managed to get a valuation of Rs1bn in less than a year. The brothers, who get to take home more than Rs18bn from this deal, will continue to work in the business for the next two years.\n\nInstagram has been a breeding ground of sorts for several homegrown brands in the skincare and beauty segment. Sugar Cosmetics, Lovechild, and Dot & Key are some of the more popular names. The Meta ecosystem helps these brands circumvent the big traditional operating costs involved in running consumer businesses. Their advertisements are Instagram reels, often featuring the founders themselves or their friends and family. Orders are placed through the same platform and customer communication is on WhatsApp. The logistics model for product delivery is also easy to access, cheap and well-established by now.\n\nCompetition is high but brands that manage to keep costs low and run a tight operation have seen valuations gallop. To me, the most significant aspect of this acquisition is that it signals the coming of age of Gen Z, which has now started entering the workforce. It is imperative for Hindustan Unilever, the grand doyen of the consumer business, to understand the ways of this new creature, their customers of the future.\n\nSunday is India\u2019s 76th Republic Day, and this year is special because it marks 75 years of the Indian Constitution.

England\u2019s tour of India is in full swing, and Saturday\u2019s T20 match is coming from the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.\n\nThis is the season for literature festivals and already my social media timeline is full of writer friends flexing about all the venues they are speaking at (not to mention posing for photographs with a Nobel laureate or two).

The fourth-largest private sector bank by market value announced a $729mn net profit for its December quarter, missing analyst expectations and sending its shares 8 per cent lower since.\n\nIts retail lending book grew by 11 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with 27 per cent growth for the same period in 2023. The bank said it had also more than doubled its cover for potential bad loans to $249mn.\n\nChief executive Amitabh Chaudhry described it as \u201ca tough environment\u201d and said rising delinquencies, especially in unsecured products, had been fuelled by \u201ccredit hungriness and over-leverage\u201d. \u201cSlippages are mainly in our retail unsecured book, largely in cards and personal loans,\u201d he added. \u201cGiven the heightened delinquency levels in the industry, we continue to remain cautious in our outlook towards unsecured.\u201d\n\nAnalysts had projected similar results for other banks. Across the industry, \u201cthere is genuine concern [that] credit growth will drop to single digits\u201d, said Rahul Arora, chief executive of Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities in Mumbai.\n\nThe RBI, which launched its crackdown on unsecured lending after millions of Indian households loaded up on easily available credit, said in its financial stability report at the end of December that its measures to curb risky lending were \u201cfructifying\u201d. The sector\u2019s annual retail lending growth was down from a compound annual growth rate of 26.9 per cent between September 2021 and September 2023 to 13 per cent in September 2024.\n\n\u201cAn area of concern, however, is the sharp rise in write-offs, especially among private sector banks, which could be partly masking worsening asset quality in this segment and dilution in underwriting standards,\u201d the central bank noted. In late 2023, the RBI raised the minimum amount of capital that must be held for personal loans from 100 per cent to 125 per cent, to decrease risks.\n\nConcerns about slowing credit \u2014 a drag on the economy with the government downgrading expected growth to 6.4 per cent this fiscal year compared to previous estimates of 8.2 per cent \u2014 have also made investors wary about the industry.\n\nSome large Indian lenders\u2019 earnings have been more robust. Kotak Mahindra Bank\u2019s shares jumped more than 9 per cent on Monday after it posted a 10 per cent rise in quarterly profit, even as money set aside for potential bad loans increased 37 per cent.\n\nBut across the sector, S&P Global Market Intelligence said the market capitalisation of India\u2019s top banks fell in the fourth quarter as \u201cinvestor sentiment turned sour amid lacklustre credit growth and shrinking margins\u201d. Of the 20 largest banks, 15 lost value compared to the previous quarter.\n\nThe Nifty Banking Index, which tracks the stock performance of India\u2019s largest lenders, has dropped 5.3 per cent over the past month \u2014 deeper than a 2.3 per cent fall in the country\u2019s blue-chip benchmark Nifty 50 over the same period.\n\nLoan growth had been mainly driven by the non-corporate segment, and business lending had yet to resume, according to Ashish Gupta, chief investment officer at Axis Mutual Fund.\n\n\u201cThere are certainly pockets that were overheated and needed to be clamped down on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the other thing is that we should allow some degree of accidents to happen, there has to be some degree of risk-taking in lending.\u201d\n\nThe pressures on the industry\u2019s loan book come as India\u2019s banking sector also struggles with tight liquidity, with the RBI ramping up dollar sales to defend the country\u2019s currency. Along with tax outflows, this \u201cmagnified the squeeze in recent weeks\u201d, said DBS Bank economist Radhika Rao.\n\nOn January 15, the central bank announced it would start conducting daily variable rate repo auctions after the banking system liquidity deficit rose past Rs2tn ($23bn) last week. Those actions were \u201clikely to at least neutralise the draining impact of regular intervention, in the face of global pressure points\u201d, Rao said.", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9a825e8d-b84d-4efd-8af4-16a927f55792"}, {"uuid4": "5d95b6f7-4062-4614-9d7e-fbbdb19f459b", "title": "The fight over land holding back India\u2019s green energy revolution", "description": "Competing demand for space is leading to bitter disputes between companies and the people who rely on farming to make a living", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2025-01-21T05:00:21.828Z", "content": "For decades, farmers had tilled the land outside the town of Nandgaon in western India, growing crops including corn and millet.\n\nBut in late 2022, Tata Power, one of the country\u2019s largest energy producers, announced it would begin setting up hundreds of glinting photovoltaic panels stretching out across that sun-drenched patch of countryside in the state of Maharashtra.\n\nThe 100-megawatt solar development by the arm of the vast Indian conglomerate, which aims to supply clean electricity to domestic steel producer Viraj Profiles, alarmed the local community. Many see the solar plant as a corporate land grab of a slice of state-owned territory that their families had been granted permission to cultivate over multiple generations.\n\n\u201cWe want the land to be ours again,\u201d declares Malik Jhela Hire, a weather-beaten 75-year-old farmer. \u201cWe want justice.\u201d\n\nAs construction began on the solar park, a group of farmers mounted protests and hunger strikes outside the offices of top local government officials, claiming their rights were being ignored.\n\nTaking note, Maharashtra\u2019s forest department, which claims purview over the land, ordered action against the Tata project. Codenamed \u201cOperation Solar\u201d, a morning raid in late March 2023 saw about 100 law enforcement officers descend on the site and seal it up.\n\nThe situation typifies the complexities India is facing as it embarks on its green energy revolution. In India, the third-biggest carbon polluter globally, billions of dollars are being poured into projects to meet a government target to more than double its non-fossil fuel sources of power to 500 gigawatts by the end of the decade.\n\nBut this breakneck effort is triggering land disputes across the world\u2019s most populous nation, highlighting the difficulty of building out capacity in fast-growing, crowded and power-hungry developing countries.\n\nThe raid on Tata\u2019s solar project is just one example of the stumbling blocks in India\u2019s energy transition. Companies are frequently struggling to find available land and are becoming ensnared in ownership conflicts.\n\n\u201cIt already is a challenge and I suspect that as more and more projects are being developed it will become an even greater challenge,\u201d says Jason Pellmar, regional industry manager for infrastructure in India, Bhutan and Maldives at the World Bank\u2019s International Finance Corporation.\n\nOther obstacles include environmental hold-ups, such as the legal protection granted to the Great Indian Bustard, a gravely endangered and poor-sighted bird that flies into renewable transmission lines in India\u2019s northern deserts.\n\nIndia\u2019s clean energy sector has also come under renewed focus after US prosecutors indicted infrastructure magnate Gautam Adani \u2014 who has raised billions of dollars from American investors \u2014 as well as some executives at the billionaire\u2019s eponymous conglomerate. The charges relate to an alleged $265mn bribery scheme of Indian officials to secure solar deals.\n\nAdani, who denies any wrongdoing, has had projects come up against marginalised communities as have many major power producers. According to Indian research group Land Conflict Watch, at least 31 disputes involving green energy projects have affected nearly 44,000 people \u2014 a figure that founder and director Kumar Sambhav calls a \u201cconservative estimate\u201d.\n\nIn a recent study, the New Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water estimates that currently only 35 per cent of onshore wind and 41 per cent of solar real estate potential in India is located in areas without historical contest over land \u2014 figures that will probably only worsen as the country makes strides towards its net zero aims.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a big problem for the developers,\u201d Sambhav adds. \u201cMany projects get stalled or delayed.\u201d\n\nThose increasing constrictions come at a critical juncture for India\u2019s green energy drive as companies like Tata expand their renewable businesses. When the conglomerate, which has set up and is constructing nearly 17GW of non-fossil fuel power capacity, first revealed it would set up the solar park near Nandgaon, Tata described it as \u201canother step\u201d in its mission to establish clean energy solutions throughout India.\n\nYet for farmers, the project represents an existential threat to practices dating back to the 1970s, when the government allowed them to farm the reserved forest land to boost food production as part of India\u2019s agricultural Green Revolution.\n\nAt the heart of the matter is confusion over who holds the ultimate title of the more than 200 acres, a question that has now reached the High Court of Bombay. To secure the site outside Nandgaon, Tata, like many businesses, turned to a land \u201caggregator\u201d, or middleman, according to people familiar with the matter. One of the people said the land had long been \u201cdelisted\u201d as environmentally protected land.\n\nBut according to forest department officials and documents seen by the Financial Times, technically no notification was seemingly issued regarding its deforestation \u2014 meaning its sale should not have been authorised, despite it no longer being a wooded area.\n\nTata Power declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation. Viraj Profile, India\u2019s renewable energy ministry, Maharashtra\u2019s state forest department and the local government in Nashik district, where the project is based, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not against renewable development,\u201d says Raju Desale, the Maharashtra state secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress and an official with the Communist Party of India, which helped organise the farmer protests.\n\nBut with Indian bureaucrats under top-down pressure to open up real estate for green energy projects, Desale adds that \u201cthey encroached the land\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that land is [the farmers\u2019] livelihood\u201d.\n\nWhen India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to the podium in Glasgow at the 2021 COP26 climate summit, he surprised the crowd by setting the country\u2019s net zero target for 2070.\n\nThe announcement was seen as a major turnaround for the coal-rich country, whose government argues that developing nations, which are not to blame for historic emissions, should rightly tap fossil fuel resources at their disposal to power their industrial growth.\n\nModi\u2019s stated ambition highlighted a shift that was already under way, with India scaling up its renewable capacity spurred by a dramatic fall in the cost of equipment such as solar panels, and a rush of green investment into the country.\n\nBut the sector has hit a familiar problem in India. Competing demands for land in this densely populated nation of 1.4bn people have long been cited by businesses as a critical bottleneck to investment. About 60 per cent of India\u2019s land is farmed, compared with the 37 per cent world average, according to the World Bank, and agriculture is the main means of livelihood for the country\u2019s majority.\n\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis estimates India\u2019s net zero goal may require up to 75,000 square kilometres of land for solar energy alone \u2014 equivalent to the size of the Republic of Ireland or about 2 per cent of India\u2019s total area. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has also calculated that a single megawatt of solar power requires on average four acres of land.\n\n\u201cAvailability of adequate land is a constraint for economic development and infrastructure growth broadly in India, and solar energy is not immune,\u201d says Shayak Sengupta, India programme lead at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.\n\n\u201cI suspect it will get more difficult to acquire land as projects spread geographically, especially as the most attractive parcels get used first.\u201d\n\nThe issue is compounded by the fact that land rights remain one of India\u2019s most sensitive political issues. Attempts by Modi\u2019s government to overhaul land acquisition laws in his more than decade-long rule have met fierce resistance. Massive protests by farmers in northern India forced the government to repeal controversial agricultural reforms in 2021, marking one of Modi\u2019s most significant policy reversals.\n\nIn practice, securing large, continuous tracts of land requires lengthy negotiations with vast numbers of farmers in a country where the average size of agricultural holdings shrank by about a third to 0.74 hectares in the five years through March 2022, according to a recent government survey. Renewable developers often have to design projects in a \u201csuboptimal way just by virtue of where you\u2019re able to procure your land\u201d, says the IFC\u2019s Pellmar.\n\nIndia\u2019s land market is also notoriously opaque, with a widespread absence of easy-to-access ownership records and complicated government acquisition rules. Developers often resort to middlemen to secure holdings, which opens the door to graft and competing claims.\n\nThose hurdles are frustrating corporate India, particularly carbon-heavy industries. \u201cIt\u2019s time-consuming,\u201d says Neha Soni, general manager for business development at ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, which has built its own wind and solar capacity to curb factory emissions. \u201cLand is a scarce commodity, so it\u2019s a constraint.\u201d\n\nModi has pushed India\u2019s states to make more land available for renewable projects and many businesses now look to local governments for access to uncontested or barren land. Some states, including Maharashtra, have also allowed those setting up green energy parks to sidestep social and environmental impact assessment requirements.\n\n\u201cState and central governments have gotten creative in helping developers acquire land through leasing or offering government land,\u201d says Sengupta.\n\nBut even this approach has limitations. In many cases, governments free up state-owned \u201ccommon land\u201d or \u201cwasteland\u201d for renewable energy projects, despite the fact that these areas are often used by local pastoralists and impoverished farmers for grazing or cultivation. These communities, which typically lack formal legal rights, are frequently left without adequate compensation or recourse when the land is repurposed.\n\nSambhav at Land Conflict Watch says these types of battles have a common theme. \u201cGovernments often present land as free of encumbrances, but on the ground, developers face protests from locals who have used it for generations.\u201d\n\nOne potential solution mooted by energy experts is the wider deployment of so-called agrivoltaics \u2014 the dual use of solar panels typically raised above working farm land. Depending on the angle and space of the equipment, crops can be protected, or exposed to light and heat.\n\nThe first such project was tested in 2012 in the western India state of Gujarat. Since then more than a dozen pilots have been attempted. A study funded and published last year by the German Agency for International Cooperation calculated that potential agrivoltaic energy generation in India could reach anywhere between more than 3,000GW and almost 14,000GW.\n\nCharles Worringham, who contributes analysis on India\u2019s energy transition for IEEFA, says the potential of agrivoltaics to reduce land conflicts is \u201cextraordinarily promising\u201d and \u201ccould really benefit\u201d the country\u2019s vast rural economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got enormous potential, but there are fairly substantial financial barriers and policy barriers to get squared away,\u201d he adds.\n\nHolding back significant agrivoltaic generation is regulation and tax strictures across many Indian states that classify land for either agricultural or commercial use, forbidding dual use of farm land for business activity beyond harvesting.\n\nExperts say the commercial viability of multipurpose cropland producing renewable energy has also not yet been tested, and many farmers will be reluctant to gamble on new technology until it is more established.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not been done at scale and in India often farmers learn from farmers, you learn from your neighbour,\u201d says Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water research institution. \u201cThe scale-up and acceleration of renewables in India is not going to come from one business model but an experiment with many.\u201d\n\nOther less land-intensive routes to net zero are being actively pursued by Modi\u2019s government, including the expansion of rooftop solar. In February last year his administration launched a subsidy programme covering up to 40 per cent of the costs of installing panels on residential properties. The aim is to cover 10mn households under the scheme by March 2027, up from 630,000 currently.\n\nOverall generation capacity of rooftop solar has expanded at a swift clip, adding more than 3GW to an almost 15.7GW total since April 2024 \u2014 though falling far short of an earlier target set by the Modi government to hit 100GW by 2022.\n\n\u201cRooftop solar could and should be part of the solution,\u201d says Pellmar from the IFC. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the ultimate answer, given the massive targets that the government of India has.\u201d\n\nFor now, many producers at the forefront of India\u2019s green energy ambitions still require large tracts of land, and some are bogged down in lengthy and heated contests. Shortly after its solar park near Nandgaon was raided and closed up, Tata Power filed a challenge against the action in the High Court of Bombay.\n\nAs the litigation winds its way through India\u2019s sluggish and overburdened legal system, Maharashtra\u2019s advocate general, the state\u2019s most senior legal adviser, asked for the project to be reopened and work recommence in the interim even as the case remains pending, according to the people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by the FT.\n\nWhile the farmers outside Nandgaon are not party to the court dispute, many of them told the FT during a recent visit to the area that they remain angry, claiming that they had been ousted from their land. Following the forest department\u2019s raid, \u201cwe had expectations that everything would be all right\u201d, says 30-year-old Sanjay Tikaram Sonawane. \u201cBut then they started work again.\u201d\n\nSome are now despondent and say there is little support for them after years of petitioning the government to grant them title to a swath of territory that they have in practice been living off for generations. \u201cWe\u2019re on our own,\u201d adds Sonawane, as uniformed security guards from the surrounding and enclosed solar park keep careful watch nearby.Additional reporting by Andrea Rodrigues in Mumbai", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a8528845-dfe9-4121-a115-c475d0302d3e"}, {"uuid4": "440f5f54-7230-4bbd-82f4-be37e1d73042", "title": "Few buyers for India\u2019s new electric cars", "description": "Also in this newsletter: Meta\u2019s troubles with the competition commission, and Gautami Gavankar\u2019s mantra", "author": "Veena Venugopal", "published_date": "2025-01-21T01:30:20.362Z", "content": "Good morning.

Chinese carmaker BYD launched its electric sport utility vehicle, Sealion 7; Vietnam\u2019s VinFast announced it would be launching two electric SUVs later this year; and homegrown Maruti Suzuki launched an electric version of its Vitara model, among others.\n\nWhile two and three-wheelers have witnessed consumer enthusiasm, the same cannot be said for cars. The government is hoping EVs will constitute 30 per cent of passenger cars in India by 2030, but they only have about 2 per cent market share now.\n\nBattery life and charging infrastructure continue to be a significant problem. It takes nearly a day to charge a car from an AC socket. While companies do install wall box chargers, they are often vulnerable to theft. In urban India\u2019s unpredictable traffic and road conditions, range anxiety is a real issue. Access to charging points on highways is almost non-existent, making EVs a consideration for a second car in the household at best.\n\nThis is a bit of a chicken and egg situation for the industry. Car sales have to cross a certain threshold for manufacturers to invest more in the charging infrastructure but the poor charging infrastructure is a deterrent for higher sales. Indian customers are still following a wait and watch approach. While the government\u2019s EV push for manufacturing will drive investment and employment, it should also augment the charging infrastructure in order to make private investments in manufacturing a feasible option.\n\nDo you own an EV?

In the US, Mark Zuckerberg is busy currying favour with the new administration, hosting a black-tie dinner for Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration after ending fact-checking on Facebook and Meta\u2019s diversity initiative. In India, on Thursday, an appeals tribunal will decide whether Meta gets some reprieve from a $24.5mn fine and stringent conditions that India\u2019s anti-monopoly watchdog has imposed.\n\nIn November, the Competition Commission of India asked WhatsApp to stop sharing user data for advertising with other Meta entities, such as Facebook and Instagram, for a period of five years. This was after the agency\u2019s 2021 review raised concerns that users of the messaging app could not meaningfully opt-out from their model of data sharing across platforms.\u00a0The social media giant has reportedly claimed the order will force it to roll back or pause some of its services in India.\n\nIndia is WhatsApp\u2019s largest market, with nearly 500mn users, and with digital payments and ecommerce it is now more than just a messaging platform. Meta\u2019s advertising business model hinges on accessing users\u2019 phone numbers, transaction data and other behavioural and device information. Internet companies make it seem like personalised advertisement is a good thing for users, when in reality it is a better thing for themselves. The CCI is taking up the fight to say that just because I discussed buying a pair of shoes with a friend, I shouldn\u2019t have to suffer being stalked by photos of those shoes on Instagram and Facebook. I, for one, am glad they have my back.\n\nTrump\u2019s inauguration committee has raised record breaking funds, with tech giants and corporate leaders from around the world contributing generously.

Great news from India\u2019s space agency, which yesterday announced it had managed a successful space docking (joining two fast moving satellites in space). India is the fourth country to manage this feat, after the US, Russia and China.\n\nIndia\u2019s software services sector could also do with some good news. Tech chief executives are keeping their fingers crossed that a Trump presidency will unleash animal spirits in American corporations, triggering higher spending on IT services. We\u2019ll take a look. But first, what are your job and salary prospects?\n\nWhere are the best jobs and what\u2019s your pay packet going to look like this year? According to the annual salary trends report published by Randstad, the best paying junior and mid-level jobs are found in Bengaluru, and senior management roles are the juiciest in Mumbai. (Excuse me for a minute while I cry in Delhi-NCR).\n\nSalaries in Bengaluru are 23 per cent and 9 per cent higher than the national average for junior and mid-levels respectively. For senior positions, Mumbai pay packets are 12 per cent higher than the national average. Surprisingly (at least to me), Bengaluru jobs are not just in the IT sector; the city leads in financial services, manufacturing, automotive, retail and consumer goods too. Mumbai (predictably) excels in finance and banking sector jobs.\n\nInternet and ecommerce \u2014 undoubtedly the growth industries currently \u2014 are the best paymasters, but salaries in the advertising, market research and public relations industries have taken a big leap too (26 per cent).\n\nBut to me, the real story is the collapse of Delhi-NCR. The report places it at rank seven (in tier 1 cities) for mid-level and senior executive pay. In both of these categories, salaries here are lower than the national average. Delhi-NCR is fifth at the junior level and the pay is a hair over the average, and it is consistently ranked seven (out of eight) in all the sectors the report analysed.\n\nTwo decades ago, when the shiny glass and chrome buildings emerged in Delhi-NCR\u2019s Gurgaon, it quickly became the hub of corporate India with large Indian conglomerates and big multinationals setting up headquarters. It was great for a while, but terrible air pollution and civic services increasingly lagging behind have really done a number on the quality of life in the national capital. The other issue is that the region is spread over three states, with different rules and standards, and there is no central authority responsible for its growth and upkeep.\n\nNow that you know where (not) to work, here\u2019s how much you can expect your pay to rise this year. A report published this week by Mercer estimates that salary increments in 2025 will be an average 9.4 per cent, a steady growth from 8 per cent in 2020. The automotive sector is expected to be the most generous, with 10 per cent salary increments (up from 8.8 per cent last year), followed by manufacturing and engineering at 9.7 per cent. Of the 1,550 companies that participated in this survey, 37 per cent plan to increase headcount.\n\nOverall, these are encouraging numbers. The jobs landscape for 2025 is looking good in India. But Delhi-ites, should we start a support group?\n\nWrite to me at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply.\n\nOn Monday, when Donald Trump takes his oath of office, one section of Indian industry will be watching with hopeful anticipation. The IT services sector, which has had a difficult few years post-pandemic, is looking forward to a Trump bump. Here\u2019s why.\n\nOne, Trump has promised to reduce corporate taxes. Industry experts expect that the money saved on tax will be directed towards technology expansion. Second, the uncertainty over the elections are over and the US economy is expected to grow. Half of India\u2019s IT services revenues come from North America and when the US grows, they grow too. In fact, it\u2019s already showing signs of a revival (see graph above). HSBC analysts estimate industry growth will be 6 per cent in the next financial year, up from about 3-4 per cent over the past two years.\n\nOur IT services companies employ 5mn people and earn revenues of $125bn, and it needs all the good news it can get. But a Trump presidency is not without its challenges for the industry. The issue of H1B visas has been raging even before Trump takes office. The president\u2019s Maga base has come out all guns blazing against IT jobs going predominantly to Indians. Plus, the nuances of the US economy in 2025 are hazy. If the new administration imposes the tariffs it has been threatening, inflationary pressures will rise.\n\nThis is a story which should not be viewed through a binary lens. My sense is that all of these scenarios will come to bear. There will be more money funding technology services but there will also be the overhang of Trump\u2019s America First policies. The next few quarters will probably be positive for the industry, but it would be foolish to extrapolate that to the entirety of Trump\u2019s term.\n\nIndia\u2019s trade deficit narrowed to a three-month low last month. Key imports were precious metals, petroleum and electronics. The government revised November\u2019s gold import figures by $5bn, attributing it to a mistake of double counting. Here\u2019s the data for December.\n\nI plan to start watching Black Warrant on Netflix this weekend. Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, this is an inside look at Delhi\u2019s notorious Tihar jail. The series is based on the book of the same name, written by Sunil Gupta, a former superintendent at the prison, and journalist Sunetra Choudhury. I read the book when it was published in 2019. It\u2019s a gripping account with familiar names from newspaper headlines. Early reviews of the show are promising.\n\nMy friend (and former boss) Sanjay Kalra sent me a playlist of Rashid Khan\u2019s songs. I don\u2019t know much about Hindustani classical, but these songs were accessible even for my musically-challenged brain. I plan to properly get into it this weekend. (Write to me if you\u2019re interested. I\u2019ll share the playlist).\n\nThe Indian national trust for art and cultural heritage (Intach) organises some lovely walks in Delhi. It\u2019s a great opportunity to learn about the history and culture of this beautiful city. (So what if we are underpaid, we get to gaze at Humayun\u2019s tomb). After two failed attempts, when I registered but couldn\u2019t make it, I\u2019m hoping to be third-time lucky and go on an Afghan food walk with them on Saturday evening.

Come on, get to the office and start working.\u201d\n\nThough the meeting was meant to stay within company walls, a video was published on Reddit and then shared widely online, to Indians\u2019 widespread outrage and bemusement.\n\nThis is not the first time a business leader has admonished employees in India for the hours they work.\n\nNR Narayana Murthy, chair of outsourcing giant Infosys, invited similar controversy last year after calling on India\u2019s youth to work 70 hours a week to compete with the likes of China, and urged them to avoid picking up \u201cnot-so-desirable habits from the west\u201d.\n\nBack in 2011 the late Ratan Tata, chair of the Tata Group, questioned the work ethic of British managers after his group\u2019s acquisitions of Jaguar Land Rover and Corus, claiming \u201cnobody is willing to go the extra mile\u201d.\n\nIn a country with a conservative government that prizes consensus and bristles at criticism, Indian corporate bosses tend to keep public statements workmanlike and patriotic, if not studiously bland.\n\nSubrahmanyan\u2019s comments have prompted attention for their frank outspokenness and reference to staring at one\u2019s wife, which some Indians found bizarre and which helped the video to go viral.\n\n\u201cHe made it sound as if being at home and being with your spouse is a terrible waste of time,\u201d said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder of Teamlease, an Indian staffing company.\n\nSome uxorious Indian men have in recent days posted pictures of themselves staring lovingly at their wives; others rechristened Sunday as \u201cStareday\u201d, which is now circulating online as a hashtag.\n\nLeading Indian chief executives have piled on \u2014 some perhaps sensing an opportunity for virtue-signalling or schadenfreude.\n\n\u201cMy wife is wonderful,\u201d Anand Mahindra, CEO of the eponymous family conglomerate, said at a conference this week in New Delhi. \u201cI love staring at her.\u201d\n\nMahindra added that the debate that had been unleashed was \u201cin the wrong direction\u201d and should be about the quality of work, not the quantity.\n\nLarsen & Toubro has largely sat out the controversy, initially backing its chair in a statement saying that \u201cextraordinary outcomes require extraordinary effort\u201d. Colleagues say he was not serious. Subrahmanyan has declined to comment.\n\nThe question of how many hours executives in India should work has led to serious debates about the country\u2019s economic growth.\n\nAway from the online japes and memes, Subrahmanyan\u2019s comments touched a nerve because India\u2019s hard-working professionals are feeling the pinch from persistent inflation and stagnating wages. These in turn feed often-voiced fears that India \u2014 no matter how hard or long people work \u2014 is heading for a \u201cmiddle income trap\u201d, in which its huge population grows old before the economy becomes rich.\n\nWhile reliable data is not available on India\u2019s average working hours, long commutes running to two or three hours both ways are common in Indian cities.\n\nRajiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Auto, said Indian companies should move away from \u201carchaic and regressive policies\u201d of enforcing long working hours and instead focus on \u201cspeed at the front line\u201d.\n\nOthers were more forthright. \u201c90 hours a week?\u201d Harsh Goenka, chair of RPG Group, fumed in a post on X. \u201cWhy not rename Sunday to \u2018Sun-duty\u2019 and make \u2018day off\u2019 a mythical concept!\u201d\n\njohn.reed@ft.com", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/96aefd59-e079-40ae-a334-03c53d02d6a0"}, {"uuid4": "86605a2d-933f-46da-9c95-6bb56098c43a", "title": "Gods, Guns and Missionaries \u2014 exploding the myth of a singular, \u2018true\u2019 Hinduism", "description": "Manu S Pillai\u2019s deft exploration of four centuries of the faith reveals its underlying complexities", "author": "Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan", "published_date": "2025-01-15T12:43:42.208Z", "content": "A book about Hinduism which begins with a maharaja\u2019s cows sounds a little like a Rudyard Kipling tale, replete with spices, mystery and \u201cbackward\u201d traditions. But in the hands of Manu S Pillai, Madho Singh II\u2019s journey from Jaipur in the west of India to imperial London for Edward VII\u2019s coronation in 1902 becomes the gateway to a deft exploration of what Hinduism actually means as a faith. Drawing on the lives of missionaries, maharajas and men of the Dutch, French and British East India Companies, Pillai builds the story of a system marked by adaptability, dynamism and compromise rather than ossified archaisms.\n\nHinduism is often imagined as a monolith of arcane and ancient rituals, in spite of the efforts of external invaders. In India itself, the image of a \u201cfaith under siege\u201d is a core part of the Hindu nationalist rhetoric wielded by the Bharatiya Janata party \u2014 a party that has now led the world\u2019s most populous nation for more than a decade.\n\nExploring four crucial centuries of Hinduism\u2019s often terse, sometimes violent and always complex relationship with other faiths, Pillai explodes the myth of a singular, unchanging, \u201ctrue\u201d Hinduism. At the same time, he lays out the factors that allowed Hindu nationalists to forge a seemingly singular, muscular identity which has come to define Hinduism for many in the 21st century.\n\nHe argues that even before the arrival of imperial powers, Hinduism was hardly a settled affair, emerging instead from \u201c[Brahmins\u2019] negotiations with a bewildering variety of counter-thoughts and alternate visions\u201d. India\u2019s priestly class was not unified, adds Pillai, adapting to local traditions ranging from sun worship to matrilineal succession as needed.\n\nMatters only become more complicated with the arrival of Europeans in India at the end of the 15th century. Early travelogues read rather like a rejected Indiana Jones script, full of human sacrifice, demon worship and libidinous, treacherous women. Vasco da Gama, upon arriving in Kerala in 1498, was less quick to judge: he entered a Hindu temple and participated in rituals, dismissing frescoes of \u201cmulti-armed beings with big teeth\u201d as local forms of saints. And as some priests engaged with Brahmins, they found that the trappings of many gods were simply a humanised vision of something more akin to a familiar and orthodox monotheism. A recognition of spiritual kinship led Italian missionary Roberto de Nobili to swap his cassock for the robes of local priests in an effort to better win over converts.\n\nNot all interactions were so harmonious. Portuguese padres in Goa, facing the pressure of the Reformation at home, clamped down on \u201cpaganism\u201d abroad by burning temples. One, Father Acquaviva, disappointed at the tolerance he found at the court of Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great, received his desired martyrdom after erecting a cross at a destroyed Hindu temple. The British East India Company shifted from distrust of missionaries as an impediment to trade to support for its \u201ccivilising\u201d mission thanks to pious parliamentarians and pressure groups. Among the catalysts for the Great Rebellion of 1857, Pillai argues, were evangelicals waving Christian texts at Hindu festivals.\n\nThe message throughout is that Hinduism is a living tradition defined more by variation than a singularity of thought and that those who would come to call themselves \u201cHindus\u201d were more than passive subjects. Priests and potentates reshaped their beliefs in ways deemed more acceptable or sophisticated, consciously rewriting older texts to remove imagery considered embarrassing for the mores of the time. Their discussions with colonial powers were not merely those of vassals lapping up to masters, but of reflective thinkers adapting to a shifting world.\n\nPillai also explores the shaping of Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) identity and how outside pressures knitted a huge variety of traditions into something like a unified whole (albeit imperfectly). The history of conquerors is central to a kind of postcolonial paranoia that sees Hindus\u2019 failure to resist as rooted in their naivety and good nature. The required remedy to resist cultural annihilation, proponents say, is to adopt an equally belligerent stance, bringing all the faithful into the fold.\n\nPillai avoids straying into the present; there are no references to the BJP or Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the text ends (chronologically) in 2003 with the unveiling of a portrait of Vinayak Savarkar, the father of Hindutva. This is not a weakness: to end with a deep dive into the BJP would suggest that the now prevalent nationalist vision of Hinduism is the religion\u2019s \u201cend point\u201d rather than a single strain.\n\nThe book closes with Bijay Chand Mahtab, maharaja of Burdwan, almost informing the pope of the \u201crevolting\u201d idolatry of Madonna shrines in early 20th century Italy. That inversion of early monstrous travelogues is more than a reminder of the underlying complexities of Hinduism; it also reflects the deep similarities between faiths. Those parallels were visible in the Enlightenment and earlier, but are increasingly at risk in an age of narrow populist agendas worldwide.\n\nGods, Guns and Missionaries: The Making of the Modern Hindu Identity by Manu S Pillai Allen Lane \u00a335, 624 pages\n\nJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Caf\u00e9 and follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/04cbeb04-ad5d-4452-bfa5-612fb86e2c20"}, {"uuid4": "df03abe4-a8d3-453e-897f-bce690b42bd3", "title": "Weakening rupee puts India interest rate cuts in doubt", "description": "Currency\u2019s decline and its implications for inflation add to doubts about health of world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2025-01-15T05:00:27.295Z", "content": "A drop in the value of India\u2019s rupee has shaken expectations that the new head of the central bank will quickly cut interest rates to stimulate the country\u2019s flagging economy.\n\nThe currency has repeatedly hit lows and a 0.7 per cent fall against the dollar on Monday was its biggest one-day dip in nearly two years.\n\nThat decline and its implications for inflation have shattered the previously near-uniform consensus among economists that Reserve Bank of India governor Sanjay Malhotra and fellow monetary policy setters will next month cut the benchmark repo rate from 6.5 per cent, the level it has been held at for nearly two years.\n\nThe falling rupee is only one of a number of indicators taking the shine off of what remains the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy.\n\nIndia registered a sharp drop in year-on-year GDP growth to 5.4 per cent in the quarter through to the end of September, the lowest level in nearly two years, amid a slowdown in government spending, waning consumption and weak corporate earnings.\n\n\u201cThe rupee fall is serious for the new RBI governor,\u201d said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, adding that it had \u201cmuddied the view\u201d that there would be a headline rate cut at Malhotra\u2019s first policy meeting, which opens just a few days after the central government lays out its annual budget on February 1.\n\n\u201cA freefall has implications for imported inflation and hence monetary policy, which is the conundrum,\u201d Sabnavis said.\n\nIndia relies on overseas suppliers for almost 90 per cent of its oil consumption, making it particularly vulnerable to a rise in crude prices that followed new US sanctions on Russian producers. Robust recent US economic data has also cast doubt on the need for the Federal Reserve to lower rates, helping strengthen the dollar.\n\nStubbornly persistent inflation, which has eroded the spending power of hundreds of millions of poor and middle-class Indian households, lies at the heart of the RBI\u2019s dilemma.\n\nFuelled by soaring vegetable prices, headline inflation breached the upper 6 per cent limit of the central bank\u2019s target band in October, though prices have since cooled with the rate slowing to 5.2 per cent in December.\n\nMalhotra, who took office last month, had said he expected India\u2019s economy to recover in 2025. He indicated the RBI would prioritise supporting \u201ca higher growth path\u201d after his predecessor Shaktikanta Das was criticised by the government for keeping borrowing costs elevated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy environment for the new governor,\u201d said Trinh Nguyen, emerging Asia economist at Natixis, adding that \u201cIndia is not alone in this conundrum\u201d with most developing nations suffering from the strong dollar. \u201cBut fundamentally, I think growth will prevail as a priority even if a rapidly weakening rupee is a concern.\u201d\n\nThe RBI has regularly intervened to prop up the currency, burning through almost $70bn of its foreign exchange reserves since they reached a record high of $705bn in September.\n\nSome economists speculate that the more recent lack of strong RBI action to stem the rupee\u2019s fall may mark a shift in stance under Malhotra towards a more market-driven view of the currency that could boost exports. The RBI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOther experts are more sanguine about the impact of the rupee\u2019s decline and believe the RBI has plenty of room to manoeuvre given an overall trend of declining inflation and the central bank\u2019s still considerable reserves.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as big a deal as it\u2019s being made out to be,\u201d said Miguel Chanco, chief emerging Asia economist at research consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. The rupee\u2019s more than 4 per cent depreciation against the dollar over the past year remained \u201cfairly manageable\u201d, Chanco said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that it\u2019s probably been due a downshift for some time, having looked pricey on a real effective exchange rate basis over the past 18 months or so,\u201d he said.\n\nMore broadly, while the RBI and India\u2019s government last month slashed their growth forecasts for the coming year to their lowest since the Covid-19 pandemic, the central bank said the economy was showing signs of bottoming out.\n\nChanco said that view might be too optimistic, given that India\u2019s fiscal and monetary policy remained tight, households were weighed down with debt and industrial capacity utilisation still was not at levels high enough to spark a fresh cycle of investment.\n\n\u201cWe probably have at least one more big downshift in headline GDP growth,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, another economist said the rebound in government capital expenditure that had been put on hold during last year\u2019s general election could also bode well for a revival of the Indian economy in the months to come.\n\n\u201cStructurally the economy is resilient,\u201d said Poonam Gupta, director-general of the National Council of Applied Economic Research in New Delhi. \u201cIt\u2019s a cyclical slowdown which timely policy actions can easily reverse.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/68250775-1c6d-4652-8423-89d55deeba45"}, {"uuid4": "eb2111a1-1157-4ece-b8aa-699d17146cd7", "title": "Indian IT outsourcers look to Trump bump to revive fortunes", "description": "After years of anaemic growth in largest market, sector expects promised deregulation to encourage tech spending", "author": "Krishn Kaushik", "published_date": "2025-01-14T05:00:51.366Z", "content": "India\u2019s vast information technology outsourcing sector is hoping for a revival of its fortunes under a second Donald Trump presidency, with an industry that derives more than half its revenues from the US expecting incentives for its customers there to increase spending.\n\nWith the new administration promising to slash corporate taxes and tame red tape, India\u2019s $128bn annual revenue back office and consultancy sector, with its huge campuses across cities from Bengaluru to Pune, sees opportunity in its largest market after years of anaemic demand and growth. \u201cMr Trump in the past has been very business savvy,\u201d said Atul Soneja, chief operating officer at Tech Mahindra \u2014 the IT business of the Mahindra Group conglomerate \u2014 in an interview in Bengaluru. \u201cWe should hopefully start seeing the benefit.\u201d\n\nIT and business process outsourcing is one of India\u2019s most important and global-facing industries, employing more than 5mn people in a country that has thus far been unable to provide large numbers of well-paid and formal job opportunities for its enormous labour force.\n\nThe sector enjoyed a surge of business as clients invested in digital services during the coronavirus pandemic. But that led to Indian tech giants becoming bloated after a hiring splurge, and the industry was hit as corporates cut back on spending with global economic pressures increasing.\n\nTata Consultancy Services, India\u2019s largest IT company, which last week reported a fifth straight decline in quarterly revenue in North America, expects a better year, in part due to improving client spending as Trump takes office this week.\n\n\u201cOnce the new administration comes in, that will also remove any uncertainty,\u201d said K Krithivasan, TCS chief executive. \u201cThere will be more confidence in discretionary programmes coming into the next financial year.\u201d\n\nNandan Nilekani, the billionaire co-founder and chair of India\u2019s second-largest IT services company Infosys, told the Financial Times in November that the \u201cbull case\u201d for the industry would be that Trump\u2019s presidency would \u201cunleash market deregulation\u201d, allowing companies to expand, while spurring more mergers and takeovers, all providing business to India\u2019s outsourcers.\n\nHis comments were echoed soon after by Rishad Premji, chair of rival Wipro, who said he believed Trump\u2019s administration would be \u201cvery pro-business and pro-growth, which helps all of our customers, which ultimately helps partners here in India and the world over\u201d.\n\nHSBC analysts estimate the industry will see growth accelerate to 6 per cent in the next financial year, up from about 3-4 per cent over the past two years, adding that the US outlook is now positive.\n\n\u201cAny tax cuts would drive more technology spending, that\u2019s a fair assumption,\u201d said Sid Pai, the Bengaluru-based co-founder of venture capital tech investor Siana Capital Management, who expected \u201csteady growth\u201d across the sector.\n\nThe renewed optimism comes as US tech executives have been beating a path to India in recent months. Last week, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella set forth a $3bn investment, while in October, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang came to Mumbai and announced a batch of artificial intelligence partnerships with the country\u2019s biggest conglomerates and outsourcing giants.However, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d protectionist stance promises to impose dramatic tariffs on countries \u2014 damaging growth, fuelling inflation and leading to the Federal Reserve being more cautious on lowering interest rates, according to a recent FT poll of more than 220 economists.\u201cA large part of demand recovery for IT services companies is dependent on how the US economy performs in 2025,\u201d said Kumar Rakesh, a Mumbai-based associate director of equity research at BNP Paribas, warning conditions for the sector could worsen if policy changes were to boost inflation and force a pause or even a reversal in rate cuts.HSBC analysts noted that Trump tax cuts in 2017 did not necessarily have a clear impact on tech spending. During the last Trump presidency, the industry also fell foul of tightening restrictions on the high-skilled H-1B visa programme, which is overwhelmingly used by Indian nationals.\n\nWhile Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s biggest tech industry backer, has argued there is \u201ca dire shortage\u201d of IT engineers in America, Indian outsourcers have since significantly reduced their dependency on H1-B workers in the US where they have offices servicing clients locally. Rakesh said less than 1 per cent of outsourcing industry employees now work on such visas. More widely, economists and industry figures in India expect the world\u2019s most populous nation, which has been edging closer into Washington\u2019s orbit and whose leader, Narendra Modi, shares good relations with Trump, could be shielded from the worst of the US leader\u2019s impulses.\n\n\u201cThe relationships between the two leaders have been very strong in the past as well, so we expect that to continue,\u201d said Tech Mahindra\u2019s Soneja.Teresa John, deputy head of research at Mumbai brokerage Nirmal Bang, who recently published research on the potential impact of \u201cTrumponomics\u201d on India, said overall the country was likely to \u201cbe relatively insulated\u201d compared with other Asian nations, such as China, given its lower trade surplus with the US.\n\n\u201cUS growth is going to hold up,\u201d she added. \u201cWe will see that flowing through to the Indian IT sector.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c41220a4-d37b-4323-a7cc-4e56eb0ae910"}, {"uuid4": "541d46da-7b2c-4805-a119-9d43cd93a227", "title": "Infosys and Cognizant slug it out", "description": "Also in this newsletter: Real money games get a breather and the Kumbh Mela in numbers", "author": "Veena Venugopal", "published_date": "2025-01-14T01:30:50.376Z", "content": "Good morning. India\u2019s inflation for December was 5.22 per cent, a four-month low, thanks to some moderation in food prices. While the trend is encouraging, it is much higher than the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s medium-term target of 4 per cent. Is this enough for a rate cut next month?\n\nIn today\u2019s newsletter, we take a look at the real money gaming industry, which got a small breather on Friday when the Supreme Court asked for a temporary pause in tax proceedings against 49 companies. But first, the war of titans: India\u2019s software service giants Infosys and Cognizant slug it out in a court in Texas.\n\nThe battle between two Indian(ish) technology majors escalated, with Infosys, on Friday, filing a counter lawsuit against Cognizant. This is the story so far: in August 2024,\u00a0Cognizant subsidiary TriZetto, which provides technology services to the US healthcare industry, took Infosys to court. It accused Infosys of building a competing program by unlawfully extracting data from its proprietary software. Now, five months later, Infosys has come out all guns blazing, not only rejecting these accusations but also levelling charges of anti-competitive practices against its rival.\n\nInfosys, in its counter suit, alleges that Cognizant obstructed the development of its healthcare platform (Helix) by poaching key personnel and placing restrictive contractual barriers. The suit specifically alleges that Ravi Kumar, who quit Infosys in October 2022 and became Cognizant\u2019s chief executive four months later, deliberately delayed the launch of Helix while he was transitioning to his new job. Infosys is seeking a jury trial and has demanded three times the damages it allegedly suffered, plus legal costs.\n\nInfosys and Cognizant have long been rivals, fighting over both client contracts as well as employees. These lawsuits also highlight the intensely competitive landscape in which Indian IT companies operate in the US, with little differentiation in the services they provide. Much is at stake for both companies. A protracted legal battle serves neither\u2019s interests, but since things have got this far, a quick retreat by either party also looks unlikely.\n\nDo you have an inside scoop on this? Write to me at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply.\n\nReal money gaming, a sector which hasn\u2019t had any good news in a while, got a breather on Friday when the Supreme Court placed a temporary halt on tax proceedings that would have cost 49 companies a whopping Rs1.1tn (about $14bn). Stocks of Delta Corp and OnMobile, which both run platforms that allow users to play games such as rummy for actual money, rose by 6.44 per cent and 2.38 per cent respectively on the news. But this is just a temporary reprieve, with the final hearing set for March 18.\n\nFor years, flush with funds and abundant user interest, real money gaming companies lobbied hard to convince the government that these were games of skill, and not of chance, a distinction that allowed them to fall in the 18 per cent tax rate. But in October 2023, the finance ministry grouped these games together with lotteries and gambling.\u00a0Not only would the companies have to start paying tax at 28 per cent, the tax would be computed on the value of the bet \u2014 not just on the winnings. The companies argue that the high rate of tax will lead to a surge in unauthorised gaming as operators go underground.\n\nThere are two significant factors at play. First, online gambling is a serious societal issue \u2014 one with devastating consequences especially in the low-income sections of the population. Second, in general, sin taxes are a populist tool in the government\u2019s arsenal and it is more likely to use them than not. While real money gaming is a big business opportunity and India\u2019s affluent are keen on spending money on it, the government\u2019s preference will be to regulate for the larger good.\n\nIn the aftermath of the government\u2019s October 2023 decision, several companies decided to move their headquarters outside India. This might just be the one industry the government is not going to invest heavily in luring back.\n\nThe Maha Kumbh, which comes around once every 12 years, started yesterday and will continue until February 26.

We\u2019ve seen this movie before. The combination in 2016 of Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s first victory saw the American populist right sensing fertile territory in the UK. It petered out. Association with Trump was not electorally helpful. Now the film has a sequel in which Britain is viewed less as a potential soulmate than a weakened enemy to be attacked by the newly buoyant international right.\n\nThere is nothing new in political internationals. From the formal Comintern to the more sinuous networks for globalisation and neoliberalism, there have always been groupings seeking to export their world view. Trump\u2019s first-term strategist Steve Bannon dreamt of a global movement. National Conservatism, an evangelical ethno-nationalist faction with strong ties to Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has worked to extend its influence in the UK.\n\nNor is Britain unused to external attacks \u2014 although in recent years it was Brexit which provoked the incoming ordnance from both Europe and the White House.\n\nWeakened EU nations, notably Germany are also facing fire from the US populist right \u2014 Elon Musk especially. But the UK always saw itself in a separate category: in the Anglosphere, economically liberal and enjoying a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with America.\n\nYet the new attacks focus on Britain\u2019s culture and institutions. The US vice-president JD Vance quips that Labour has turned the UK into an \u201cIslamist country\u201d. Javier Milei, Argentina\u2019s president, parroted the falsehoods that lionise the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, telling Davos delegates that \u201cas we speak, in the UK, citizens are being imprisoned for exposing horrifying crimes committed by Muslim migrants\u201d. Musk\u2019s onslaughts are well-documented and his hostility widely shared on parts of the American right. Ministers soothe themselves with the fact that Trump himself has (so far) refrained from joining the uncoordinated assaults. But even so there are reasons to take it seriously.\n\nThe first is that the UK is floundering. Sir Keir Starmer is unpopular. His new government is facing both ways, increasing taxes and regulation while declaring growth its primary mission. Britain appears up for grabs (as is much of the Anglosphere, with Canada and Australia likely to turn right this year).\n\nSecond, and perhaps most important, this new conservative international is not primarily an economic movement. For sure, the tech billionaires want to undermine a regulatory opponent in Brussels, but Maga\u2019s economics are populist. Its leaders are not troubled if that leads to incoherent policies tailored nationally.\n\nThe movement\u2019s defining feature \u2014 as evidenced by the focus on Islam \u2014 is cultural nationalism. Immigration is the tip of this spear. What unifies the diverse groups on the right is a central argument that the canon of \u201cJudeo-Christian\u201d western values is threatened from within by multiculturalism and progressivism. From the fear of immigrants to the promotion of policies to boost birth rates, the core premise is that the west must act to save its culture.\n\nAllied to this is the argument that the same guilty liberals have also tilted economic policy against ordinary people, via a deep state that does not even work very well. As European economies stutter, these cultural grievances are accelerated by podcasts and social media.\n\nThere is one other key difference: the decontamination of Trump. This time the new conservative international has major bridgeheads in the UK both in Farage\u2019s Reform UK and much of the Conservative party. Tories who kept their distance in 2016 are now openly supportive. Boris Johnson, shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, Nigel Farage and Liz Truss made pilgrimages to Washington for the inauguration.\n\nPolitical attacks have been encouraged and copied by the British right. Suella Braverman, former home secretary, echoed Vance. Little distinguishes the rhetoric of Robert Jenrick, Tory justice spokesman, from Musk.\n\nBritish radical right voices discern a winning Maga agenda for the UK, based around immigration crackdowns, deporting foreign criminals, scrapping net zero initiatives, pushback on trans rights and cuts to Whitehall bureaucracy. Only in their small-state hostility to the NHS do Britain\u2019s populists offer an exploitable vulnerability.\n\nFurthermore, the electoral system, for so long a bulwark against new and hardline parties, might now actually work to their advantage. Talk of a Reform government is overdone, but the party\u2019s current standing could give it a decisive voice in the next parliament. Fear of Reform is pulling Conservatives on to the same territory. One senior Tory laments \u201cLabour has become too unpopular too quickly. We haven\u2019t had time to rebuild our brand.\u201d Meanwhile, Starmer lacks the communication skills to respond to an assertive right.\n\nAnd victory does not have to be absolute. The movement has already shifted the boundaries. Farage\u2019s surging party is now mainstream and the Conservatives have moved to the right. Progressives within the government find themselves in retreat as ministers fret about the threat of Reform.\n\nIt is early days. Labour may recover. Trump\u2019s lustre may fade. But the conservative international has a new sense of momentum. This movie might yet have a different ending.\n\nrobert.shrimsley@ft.com", "tag": "world-uk?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e58d02fe-31ed-4a82-b9e3-d2c631d6074f"}, {"uuid4": "fa0de4f2-2f49-46c4-a4c4-7d03507893ca", "title": "Bank of England warns of risks in relaxing mortgage limits", "description": "Andrew Bailey welcomes \u2018open public debate\u2019, but cautions that easing rules could lead to more repossessions", "author": "Martin Arnold", "published_date": "2025-01-29T18:54:02.334Z", "content": "The Bank of England governor has warned that government-backed proposals to water down limits on riskier mortgage lending could trigger more home repossessions and fail to help first-time buyers, even as he announced plans to review the policy.\n\nAndrew Bailey told MPs on Wednesday he was \u201cvery happy to have a very open public debate\u201d about the restrictions on UK mortgage lending, but said this should take account of the \u201cbetter outcomes\u201d the rules had provided in avoiding a surge in home loan defaults during recent shocks.\n\n\u201cThey have helped to avoid the creation of a large tail of mortgages, which, when we have the inevitable cyclical downturn or shocks that hit the economy, turn out to be a real problem of the sort we have seen in the past,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cSo I think that has been beneficial.\u201d\n\nHis comments indicate the BoE is reluctant to further relax restrictions on British banks\u2019 mortgage lending after having done so as recently as November. The BoE\u2019s sister regulator the Financial Conduct Authority proposed going further earlier this month.\n\nUK chancellor Rachel Reeves backed the FCA\u2019s proposal, telling the Financial Times last week she was \u201cabsolutely open to looking at ideas that can boost home ownership and help working families get on the housing ladder\u201d.\n\nReeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer have urged all UK regulators, including the BoE and FCA, to do more to support its goal of reviving the country\u2019s stagnant economy by easing the burden of rules on business.\n\nBailey told the Treasury select committee that he supported Starmer\u2019s push to boost growth, but said \u201cthere isn\u2019t a trade-off\u201d between this and the BoE\u2019s primary objective of preserving financial stability.\n\nUK mortgage lending is controlled by a mixture of rules from the central bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee and the FCA, most of which were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis when several banks were bailed out by the state.\n\nThe FPC limits banks above a certain size to lending no more than 15 per cent of mortgages worth more than 4.5 times a household\u2019s income. It changed the lending threshold of this limit in November so it applied to fewer banks.\n\nThe FCA requires banks to carry out affordability tests on applicants for mortgages to ensure they could still afford the monthly repayments if interest rates rose in future. The BoE ditched a similar affordability test in 2022 because it overlapped with the FCA\u2019s rules.\n\nThe FCA said a letter to Starmer this month \u2014 in response to a call from the government asking regulators for pro-growth ideas \u2014 that it would \u201cbegin simplifying responsible lending and advice rules for mortgages, supporting home ownership and opening a discussion on the balance between access to lending and levels of defaults\u201d.\n\nBailey said the potential benefits of easing these limits further would have to be balanced against the gains from keeping them. He also warned it may do little to help first-time buyers whose main obstacle to buying a home is frequently the difficulty in affording the necessary deposit.\n\n\u201cIn all the surveys that are done, when you ask what is the major impediment to getting into the mortgage market, it is affording the deposit,\u201d said Bailey.\n\nNathana\u00ebl Benjamin, the BoE\u2019s executive director for financial stability strategy and risk, told MPs there was still \u201cplenty of headroom\u201d before banks hit the limit on mortgage lending \u201cso that isn\u2019t a barrier\u201d, adding that the proportion of first-time buyers in new mortgage lending was at its highest level for 20 years.\n\nHe also warned that easing limits without increasing the supply of new homes was likely to push up house prices, which would \u201cmake things even more difficult for households to get on the housing ladder\u201d.", "tag": "world-uk?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/25e466a2-3316-4724-9220-c3311ec015ed"}, {"uuid4": "db3747fe-ab7a-48ec-a6b1-bc73a79037e8", "title": "Harland & Wolff\u2019s new owner pledges \u00a3100mn to revive UK shipbuilder", "description": "Spain\u2019s Navantia says it will push for new orders, including from Royal Navy, to secure future of group", "author": "Jude Webber", "published_date": "2025-01-29T18:44:10.736Z", "content": "Harland & Wolff\u2019s new Spanish owner, Navantia, will invest \u00a3100mn to reactivate the UK shipbuilder and deliver a key Royal Navy contract while pushing for new orders that will \u201cdetermine the future of the company\u201d.\n\nDonato Mart\u00ednez, Navantia\u2019s director of strategy, said on Wednesday the state-owned group aimed to triple H&W\u2019s workforce and invest a further \u00a3100mn-\u00a3200mn in the coming years, a measure of its long-term commitment to the bankrupt company best known for building the Titanic.\n\nNavantia this week took over H&W\u2019s four shipyards \u2014 in Belfast, Appledore in England and two in Scotland \u2014 after pushing the UK government to improve the terms of its \u00a31.6bn contract to build three Fleet Solid Support vessels for the Royal Navy.\n\nNeither Navantia nor the UK government said how big the increase was, with Jonathan Reynolds, the UK\u2019s business secretary, insisting only the \u201cabsolute minimum of changes to the contract to ensure its continued delivery\u201d were agreed.\n\n\u201cWe have not finalised the amendment to the FSS contract [with the UK Ministry of Defence], which is required because obviously the original plan cannot be met with the situation [at H&W],\u201d Mart\u00ednez told the Financial Times after a ceremony in Belfast to mark the new ownership.

Projects at Stansted and City have already been approved.\n\nIf delivered, the expanded airports could handle 309mn passengers annually \u2014 an 85 per cent increase on the 167mn travellers who used the airports in 2023, the last year for which there is complete data \u2014 according to a Financial Times analysis.\n\nThe scale of the plans shows how airports, and their group of largely international investor owners, are betting that air travel will continue to grow in the coming decades, unencumbered by concerns over carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cThe chancellor is right to get behind airports,\u201d said Karen Dee, chief executive of trade association AirportsUK. \u201cExpanding capacity will support growth\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and will not come at the expense of our sustainability goals.\u201d\n\nBut industry experts said growth of this scale would throw up serious challenges, including the need to redraw the flight paths in the skies over London and the south east of England to accommodate all the extra aircraft, likely impacting new communities with noise pollution.\n\nEnthusiasm from the chancellor also belied barely-concealed tensions within the cabinet that have emerged over the UK\u2019s most contentious infrastructure project in decades.\n\nIf successful, it would also likely make flying more expensive, particularly from Heathrow, as the airport raises the landing fees charged to airlines to recoup the cost of building the runway.\n\nStill, Becrom Basu, a partner at LEK Consulting who has advised Heathrow, said the new capacity would be used.\n\n\u201cThe London market has been struggling to meet demand for a while\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I think investors can be comfortable there will be a business case for that level of demand,\u201d he said.\n\nBy far the most serious challenge is likely to be the impact of airport expansion on the UK\u2019s carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cI find it a bit difficult to see how you could have a third runway at Heathrow and a significant expansion of flight numbers at Gatwick within the government\u2019s carbon budget,\u201d said one person closely involved with the 2015 Conservative government decision to back a third runway at Heathrow. The airport never put forward a planning application because of the pandemic, however.\n\nCasting herself as a chancellor willing to make \u201cbold decisions in the national interest\u201d, Reeves called on Heathrow\u2019s management to put forward plans to build a third runway as soon as this summer.\n\nWhile previous governments had offered lukewarm support to the politically controversial project, Heathrow\u2019s chief executive Thomas Woldbye said he believed the airport would now \u201csit round the table together\u201d with the government to deliver the third runway.\n\n\u201cWe can trust the government, they can be with us for many years,\u201d he said.\n\nWoldbye said the airport will now dust off its 2019 blueprint for expansion, which was shelved when the pandemic struck in 2020. Costed at \u00a314bn in 2014, it involves diverting the nearby M25 motorway into a tunnel, demolishing 750 homes, a primary school and an energy plant.\n\nBut few doubt the scale of the political challenges still facing the project.\n\nEarlier this month energy secretary Ed Miliband said he would not resign if the third runway went ahead, in what appeared to be a capitulation by the project\u2019s biggest cabinet opponent.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, Miliband was said to be \u201clivid\u201d, according to one government figure familiar with the situation. He was not among the cabinet ministers at the speech.\n\nOther cabinet ministers were also taken aback by what appeared to be a sudden decision by Reeves several weeks ago. \u201cThere really has been a huge row about it, between the Treasury and just about everybody,\u201d said one person close to the discussions.\n\nSome Whitehall officials even suggested Reeves had tried to bounce Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer \u2014 who previously voted against the measure \u2014 into publicly endorsing the project. He so far avoided doing so, ducking a question on it at last week\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Questions session.\n\nDespite Reeves\u2019 warm words, one sceptic inside the government said that Heathrow\u2019s development consent order would still have to pass stringent criteria on climate, air pollution and noise.\n\n\u201cThey will still have to reach the same standards that they did 24 hours before this announcement,\u201d they said. \u201cThere is a lot of road to run on this.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile long-standing opponent London mayor Sadiq Khan said he remained \u201csimply not convinced that you can have hundreds of thousands of additional flights at Heathrow every year without a hugely damaging impact on our environment\u201d.\n\nRuth Cadbury, Labour MP for Brentford & Isleworth \u2014 and chair of the transport select committee \u2014 said the committee would now examine \u201chow clear the links between airport expansion and growth\u201d are.\n\nCadbury said she was sceptical that the project could ever meet the four tests set by the government on climate change, regional economic benefits, noise and air pollution.\n\n\u201cThe test is whether the project provides growth for UK [businesses] as a whole, for the nations and regions, and does it? Not really,\u201d she said.\n\nReeves, by contrast, insisted the third runway would benefit the entire country.\n\nReeves insisted the expansion was compatible with the government\u2019s \u201clegal, environmental and climate obligations\u201d, as she pointed to technological advances that could pave the way to \u201ccleaner and greener aviation\u201d.\n\nThe aviation industry agrees it can grow while decarbonising. Its road map to net zero 2050, published in 2022, assumes that passenger numbers can still grow while emissions fall.\n\nTo do this it is largely relying on \u201csustainable aviation fuels\u201d or SAFs, which are made up of a diverse range of sources from crops and used cooking oil to household waste. The industry estimates they can emit about 70 per cent less carbon dioxide over its life cycle than traditional aviation fuel.\n\nBut it is far more expensive than jet fuel and currently only available in tiny quantities. Airline bosses have said the industry will need considerably more government support to scale up the production of SAFs to reach net zero.\n\nColin Walker, head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit research group, said the government\u2019s hopes that sustainable aviation fuel will offset the extra emissions from Heathrow\u2019s expansion \u201care unrealistic\u201d.\n\n\u201cA third runway will increase emissions way beyond the capacity of these fuels to offset them,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile planning experts said Heathrow has spent decades unsuccessfully pushing for growth.\n\n\u201cHeathrow would have to run really hard and the government\u2019s decisions would be challenged along the way,\u201d said Alistair Watson, partner and head of planning at Taylor Wessing.\n\n\u201cThe only ones who will win from this are lawyers.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a16706ea-9d64-4840-a0fc-4a7c922d3840"}, {"uuid4": "8f9db75c-8cab-4da0-b8ba-906814bb3ffe", "title": "Labour is facing two ways on growth", "description": "The UK government is starting to change the narrative but needs a joined-up approach", "author": "The editorial board", "published_date": "2025-01-29T18:21:20.352Z", "content": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 change of tone on growth has been long in coming. The Labour government\u2019s repeated emphasis since coming to power on its lousy inheritance from 14 years of Conservative rule \u2014 though correct \u2014 has damaged business and consumer confidence, and made its own task even harder. The UK chancellor has at last begun to construct a more positive and forward-looking narrative. Yet this is a government that still faces two ways on growth. It vaunts its commitment to rekindling the animal spirits of enterprise even as the taxes and regulation it has heaped on to business are impeding the expansion it claims to want.\n\nIf the growth quest is to succeed, one priority must be to demonstrate a joined-up approach across government. Reeves\u2019 statements that economic expansion is the sine qua non of Labour\u2019s entire agenda often seem aimed at convincing fellow ministers as much as the country at large. Prime minister Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s pledge to \u201chard wire\u201d growth into cabinet decisions, by requiring \u201cgrowth credentials\u201d to be set out in policy consultations, is positive. But parts of the cabinet\u2019s programme \u2014 notably its overcooked employment rights bill \u2014 still work against its supposedly overriding priority.\n\nThe government needs to ensure, too, that its enthusiasm for grand projects that may take decades to bear fruit is matched by a zeal to sweep away the constraints on more immediate investment across the economy. Committing to major developments such as the Oxford-Cambridge \u201cgrowth corridor\u201d and a third runway at Heathrow \u2014 provided they are delivered \u2014 is important as a way of driving long-term GDP growth. It sends a useful message to overseas investors that Britain remains ambitious and open to business. Business groups are clear that well-planned infrastructure developments create jobs and lasting economic gains.\n\nYet what many companies, especially small and mid-sized businesses that account for half of all private-sector turnover, are interested in above all is faster progress on deregulation, such as easing planning controls on everything from housing to wind farms.\n\nAfter the government ousted the chair of its competition watchdog last week, they want to hear quickly how it plans to strike the elusive balance between a lighter-touch regulatory approach and opening up the risks of abusive corporate behaviour or financial failures. A truly smart approach here could create a competitive advantage over the sclerotic EU, which on Wednesday launched its own effort to slash red tape in the face of Donald Trump\u2019s deregulation drive in the US.\n\nAbove all, however, Labour needs to correct its own mistakes \u2014 and lighten the new burdens it heaped on to business by placing the brunt of the \u00a340bn tax increase in its October Budget on to employers and imposing onerous worker rights rules. The government is unlikely to row back on its headline increase in payroll taxes, though it should look again at how inheritance tax changes will hit family businesses. That leaves the employment rights bill as the area most ripe for concessions. Labour must address business concerns over the way it plans to grant day-one protections against unfair dismissal, broaden the rights of those on zero-hour contracts and hand more powers to unions in the workplace.\n\nThere are other areas where more boldness is needed. Labour should rethink the red lines that are hemming in its ability to conclude the ambitious new deal it says it wants with the EU. But if its commitment to its overriding priority is genuine, Labour\u2019s biggest task is to heed what the enterprises that can deliver growth say they need.", "tag": "world-uk?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/70bb9d44-49f0-4ec6-9e6a-ecca8397e770"}, {"uuid4": "ec6e946e-ffe7-4200-97e7-e1098c96b19a", "title": "UK-based spy ring had links to top Bulgarian politicians, court told ", "description": "Three defendants accused of carrying out Russian-backed espionage ", "author": "Martha Muir", "published_date": "2025-01-29T18:13:41.289Z", "content": "A UK-based spy ring gathering intelligence for Russia had links to the \u201chighest echelons\u201d of the Bulgarian government, prosecutors said on Wednesday.\n\nBiser Dzhambazov, 43, told Orlin Roussev, 46, that his relationship with several Bulgarian politicians \u2014 such as President Rumen Radev, former deputy prime minister Korneliya Ninova and National Assembly member Boyko Rashkov \u2014 was \u201ciron clad\u201d, prosecutors said.\n\nThe pair have both pleaded guilty to conspiring to spy on behalf of Russia.\n\nThe allegations come from the trial of three Bulgarians \u2014 Katrin Ivanova, 33, Vanya Gaberova, 30, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39 \u2014 who have been charged with conspiracy to spy in a ring that prosecutors say was overseen by former Wirecard chief operating officer Jan Marsalek.\n\nProsecutor Alison Morgan KC told the jury at the Old Bailey court in London that the pair were \u201cgleeful\u201d about the outcome of Bulgaria\u2019s November 2021 general election, which the incumbent Radev won, and \u201ccould not wait to get started on exploiting those connections\u201d.\n\nIn December 2021, Dzhambazov told Roussev that they had to \u201cwork out\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009what we want and what we offer\u201d to the Bulgarian government, adding \u201cI\u2019m sure they won\u2019t let us down\u201d.

This was necessary. The negative background mood, after hopes rose ahead of the election and immediately after, relapsed following the October Budget to one of recurrent disappointment, low expectation and dismay at the apparent lack of a narrative.\n\nThe UK has re-entered a period of close to zero economic growth. The hit to business confidence, induced by the Budget, has been compounded by concerns about rising global bond yields and the constraints this places on the government\u2019s ability to spend, and with it, to borrow.\n\nIn her speech, Reeves acknowledged the cost to business from the national insurance increase \u2014 and again attempted to explain that she felt it necessary to get the finances under control. But as she pivoted to talk about the supply side, the picture became much more hopeful.\n\nRather than becoming overly stressed about demand management, I believe this supply-side focus is right. First, because much of the demand will be determined by the Bank of England: if interest rates are reduced in the way many forecast, this should be an important driver. So Reeves would not want to take steps to offset this possibility too much \u2014 not least because it would probably help bring UK bond yields down.\n\nSecond, as ministers have been eager to tell anyone who will listen, the government is constrained by its own fiscal rules, the first of which limits current spending. If it wants to avoid further tax rises, it will have to stick to them \u2014 or something close to them.\n\nThird \u2014 and this is especially important \u2014 the UK\u2019s problem going right back to the 2008 financial crisis, and before, has always been the supply side. Namely, our woeful productivity and our weak private and public investment. Since the crisis, feeble average growth of 1.5 per cent has been almost completely driven by very strong labour force growth. Productivity growth has remained extremely weak. If we are to have stronger growth while being less inflation-prone, we need more investment and more productivity \u2014 it really is that simple.\n\nSo Reeves needs to ensure that the government\u2019s 10-year infrastructure strategy is centre stage from now on.\n\nThe chancellor correctly talked about excessive regulation, planning approval blocks and a lack of commitment to growth-enhancing investment projects. She promised support for a large scattering of projects to address the persistent delays and barriers to infrastructure, including the Ox-Cam project, support for a third runway at Heathrow as well as a number of schemes in the north of England.\n\nWhat was missing was the framework. There was no place in her narrative for the institutions that will be crucial to delivering transparent, high-multiplier investments \u2014 and they are not actually yet up and running. But this emphasis will be necessary if the government is to instil confidence in investors.\n\nChancellors always like to announce big attention-catching investments even if, like the Heathrow expansion, they are controversial. Very often, though, these are not accompanied by fresh government capital and are announced on a \u201ctrust us\u201d basis in terms of real, lasting benefits.\n\nIn this, Reeves is no exception. She cited Frontier Economics research suggesting that a third runway would have positive multipliers outside the London area \u2014 this should become part of the framework for every major initiative. But it must be done systematically, especially as the government will need to observe its second fiscal rule, and borrow to invest. Without such a framework, \u201ctrust us\u201d might not get such a positive response from the gilt or equity market.\n\nThe new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority will not be established until April. But this entity, along with the National Audit Office and others, will be absolutely fundamental to encouraging business, inside and outside of the UK, to boost the economy\u2019s growth potential with investments. I am surprised that the chancellor chose not to talk about it: in effect, this will add and support the growth-focused division of the Treasury that both Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer have promised to establish.\n\nIn this spirit, I hope that Reeves will empower Nista to be completely transparent about the investment projects that will have positive multipliers. Because this is also the pathway for indirectly boosting the demand side of the economy, unleashing longer-lasting animal spirits in business and consumers alike.", "tag": "world-uk?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/26f8a8c1-aabc-4513-8137-ff1144db0f74"}, {"uuid4": "24954057-ec61-4796-8801-be797609600a", "title": "Reform UK\u2019s Mayfair fundraiser attracts \u2018disgruntled\u2019 ex-Tory donors", "description": "Attendees paid five-figure sums to attend dinner hosted by Nigel Farage on Tuesday ", "author": "Anna Gross", "published_date": "2025-01-29T17:04:10.562Z", "content": "More than half a dozen major former Conservative donors paid five-figure sums to attend a lavish fundraiser for Reform UK that raised more than \u00a31mn on Tuesday evening.\n\nPast Tory supporters Bassim Haidar and Mohamed Amersi confirmed their presence, and that they had each paid \u00a325,000 for a VIP ticket to the event in order to sit at the top table with party leader Nigel Farage.\n\nHaidar said there were at least eight significant former Conservative donors including himself at the event, while Amersi estimated there were many more \u201cdisgruntled Tory donors\u201d at the gathering of about 100 people.\n\nHaidar, a Nigerian-born Lebanese entrepreneur who has given \u00a3675,000 to the Conservatives in the past two years, told the FT the event was \u201ca valuable opportunity to learn more about the party\u2019s mission, and I believe they have a good one to \u2018make the UK great again\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe said it was \u201cworth considering them as a strong alternative\u201d to the Tories, whose crackdown on non-doms prompted vocal criticism from Haidar last year.\n\nFellow tycoon Amersi, a UK citizen born in Kenya, said the party \u201ccertainly appeared far more electable than I would ever have imagined, and Farage was inspirational.\u201d He added: \u201cThe energy was electric.\u201d\n\nHe said Nigel Farage\u2019s links to Donald Trump were an \u201cadded bonus\u201d and praised property magnate Nick Candy, the former Tory donor who became Reform\u2019s treasurer last month.\n\nAmersi, who has given more than \u00a3500,000 to the Tories since 2018, said he remained a Conservative member and would be attending a cocktail party it was hosting on Wednesday night in London, as he wished to keep abreast of developments.\n\nBut he said the Tories were \u201closing momentum\u201d and accused party leader Kemi Badenoch of having \u201cno policies, no outreach, no connectivity\u201d, adding that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what ground she is occupying\u201d.\n\nAsked about past Tory donors attending the Reform dinner this week, Badenoch\u2019s spokesperson said on Wednesday: \u201cThere are lots of donors out there and we\u2019re looking for new donors all the time, bringing donors back to the party, so we are very confident about our fundraising.\u201d\n\nThey added that the Tory leader is getting the party back on a sure financial footing ready to fight the local elections in May.\n\nMyles Barclay, a young member of the Barclay banking family, and Andrew Reid, the British horse race trainer and former treasurer of the UK Independence party, also attended the dinner, according to two people who attended the event.

According to industry data this month from Kantar, Morrisons\u2019 sales growth lagged behind Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2014 the UK\u2019s two largest supermarket chains \u2014 as well as discounters Aldi and Lidl during the festive period.\n\nMorrisons\u2019 like-for-like sales rose 4.9 per cent in its fourth quarter to October 27, the strongest quarter since the start of 2021, compared with a 3.3 per cent increase during the same quarter the previous year.\n\nGroup full-year like-for-like sales were up 4.1 per cent, while total revenue increased 3.8 per cent to \u00a315.3bn. Underlying profits, its preferred metric, rose 11.2 per cent to \u00a3835mn, the company said.\n\nAnnual pre-tax loss broadly halved to about \u00a3500mn, according to finance chief Jo Goff, and net debt has fallen to about \u00a33bn, from \u00a35.5bn \u201cat peak\u201d. Its annual interest payments are about \u00a3250mn a year, she added.\n\nLast year Morrisons agreed a deal to sell its petrol forecourt business to Motor Fuel Group, also owned by CD&R, with the majority of the \u00a32.5bn proceeds used to pay down its debt.\n\nEleanor Simpson-Gould, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cMorrisons has begun to emerge from a bleak period of meagre sales and mounting debt with a strengthened balance sheet.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b841f643-4462-4524-96d0-3a376eaa3c55"}, {"uuid4": "fad5b9fb-6187-4f16-a7f7-1877cac086a7", "title": "American and European populism don\u2019t mix", "description": "Elon Musk will find the European right more statist than some progressives at home", "author": "Janan Ganesh", "published_date": "2025-01-29T13:03:24.710Z", "content": "Two conflicting thoughts about DeepSeek seem plausible right now. Forced to be resourceful, China is starting to expose the artificial intelligence sector of the US as flabby and coddled. Alternatively, don\u2019t panic, America: the brute scale of US capital will tell in the end, as will the nation\u2019s openness to foreign talent.\n\nEither way, notice the absence of a third horse from all the discussion this week. You wouldn\u2019t know that Europe accounts for a comparable share of world economic output to China and the US. Whatever the feats of such companies as Mistral, the continent\u2019s role in AI \u2014 in fact, its place in the world \u2014 is increasingly that of an infant watching both parents squabbling overhead.\n\nHow has it come to this? Over-regulation of business, say some. Or a far from complete single market, which means that close to half a billion people (who are well-off by world standards) count for less than they should. Yet a third speculation is that Europe lacks an entrepreneurial culture. Whatever relative weight you accord these factors, notice that each one is to some extent a choice. It is hard to escape the conclusion that Europe\u2019s \u201crevealed preference\u201d is to forfeit some economic dynamism for other things.\n\nThis is why, despite their best efforts, Elon Musk and other Silicon Valley moguls around Donald Trump will struggle to shape Europe. Their techno-libertarianism has much less purchase on the other side of the Atlantic, even \u2014 or especially \u2014 among the hard right. Who can imagine Marine Le Pen, supporter of free public transport for young workers, freezing government grants and loans as Trump tried to do this week? Even Giorgia Meloni, a pro-market reformer of sorts, has spent much of the time since the pandemic disbursing EU funds.\n\nIn Europe, nationalism is bound up with paternalism to a degree that is alien to the US experience. (Imperial Germany under Bismarck pioneered the welfare state.) The UK isn\u2019t an exception. Brexit was, in part, a bet that British people are essentially Americans in their relish for capitalism, if only the dead hand of Brussels would let them go. Well, the fifth anniversary of the formal exit is this Friday. Still no UK government has felt politically safe to cut much regulation. Even the flintiest Tory must know that, if a single day were shaved off the statutory paid leave allowance, say, there would be pandemonium, much of it among Brexit voters. To be \u201crightwing\u201d in Europe and America just means different things.\n\nEven within the Trump government, the tech bros are at philosophical odds with the pro-worker Maga base. But at least the two camps can come together over American jingoism. What is going to glue Musk to Europe\u2019s hard right? A shared position on certain cultural issues? It doesn\u2019t seem enough to paper over such wildly different visions of the proper relationship between the individual and the state. Granted, both sides have an interest in the paralysis or destruction of the EU: it would spare Silicon Valley a lot of regulation. But the idea that tech would get an easier ride from a fragmented, populist-led Europe could only be entertained by someone with no knowledge of, say, Le Pen\u2019s economic platform over the years.\n\nThe attempt to build a transatlantic club of populists isn\u2019t new. Another Trump associate, Steve Bannon, tried it in the past decade. These projects tend to fall short for a reason that shouldn\u2019t need spelling out. If a movement\u2019s core idea is national assertiveness, the various branches of it around the world will almost by definition come into conflict. One nation\u2019s expansionist territorial claims affect another\u2019s. The desire of Strongman X to push his tech companies into foreign markets rubs against Strongman Y\u2019s security paranoia and amour propre. The Russo-Japanese war, Operation Barbarossa, the Sino-Soviet split: liberalism owes its survival in large part to the innate fissiparousness of those who hate it. Trump, Le Pen and the like aren\u2019t monsters on anything approaching that scale. But the principle that jingoists tend to fall out, must fall out, holds. There won\u2019t be a Nationalist International.\n\nNot long ago, self-respecting European reactionaries almost defined themselves against the US, which they saw as both culturally imperial and culturally empty. Even in the cold war, when the alternative was communism, parts of the continental right stood aloof. At least US Republicans used to notice the snub, and mind. Now? No head of government in the EU is closer to China than Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary. Yet no head of government in the EU is more beloved of America\u2019s anti-China hard right. Whether this double game says more about his wiliness or the attention span of today\u2019s Republicans, it is a lesson in how differently a European populist can see geopolitics from an American.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a call for liberals to relax. The US right has the resources to put more than a thumb on the scales of European politics. With a federal election close, the Alternative for Germany is being magnified through the personal attention of Musk. But these are tactics. A more lasting alliance, an American-exported revolution, assumes a harmony of worldview that isn\u2019t there. If the European hard right succeeds, it won\u2019t be on account of outsiders whose very foreignness might incur a backlash. Liberalism has always been able to count on its enemies turning their belligerence on each other.\n\njanan.ganesh@ft.com", "tag": "world-uk?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4c825adc-11ac-4fd7-be9f-37155468e8a3"}, {"uuid4": "f34f96b1-6fda-4b61-aeea-c57b351198f3", "title": "Heathrow expansion can support growth \u2014 with a long runway", "description": "A shovel is yet to hit the ground despite efforts to expand the hub dating back decades \u2014 and the barriers remain huge", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-01-29T13:03:15.904Z", "content": "Get Britain building again! In any conversation about the UK\u2019s ability to construct large, growth-boosting infrastructure projects \u2014 or not \u2014 a third runway at Heathrow tops the list of missed opportunities. Efforts to expand the west London hub date back decades.\n\nThat makes it an obvious target for UK chancellor Rachel Reeves, who wants to persuade investors and businesses that her government is pro-growth. The difficulty is convincing them that a third runway can actually be delivered.\n\nOn paper, there are some sound economic arguments to support expansion. Heathrow is not only the UK\u2019s busiest airport, catering to an estimated 83.8mn passengers in 2024, it is also the country\u2019s largest port by value.\n\nEven with its current two runways it has kept increasing passenger numbers, breaking a fresh record in November. Yet further growth, through small changes such as persuading airlines to switch to bigger jets, will have limits. Flights are capped at 480,000 annually. Slots to launch new routes are constrained; the airport is running at 99 per cent capacity.\n\nThere are soft benefits, too. Almost any traveller will have a story about delays or flight cancellations at Heathrow \u2014 in part a symptom of its capacity constraints.\n\nTrue, there are five other \u201cLondon\u201d airports that airlines can choose from, if Southend in Essex is included. But Heathrow is a favourite for long-haul carriers as transfer traffic makes certain routes economically viable.\n\nIn reality, though, the barriers remain huge. A previous Labour administration approved a third runway at the airport in 2009. A shovel is yet to hit the ground.\n\nEven if the weighty concerns of environment campaigners and west London residents could be swept aside, the cost and how it can be funded without making passengers and airlines balk are still big unknowns. Even in 2014, when Heathrow forecast the cost at close to \u00a314bn, others reckoned this was an underestimation. Airlines are wary of how much charges \u2014 passed on to passengers \u2014 would have to rise to fund the returns private investors would demand.\n\nOf course impasses over big, tricky projects have been broken before. Nuclear power plants in the UK had a similar stop-start history, which ended in 2016 when Theresa May\u2019s government gave the go-ahead for the Hinkley Point C plant in south-west England. But now over-time and over-budget, it may not be a comparison the government is keen to make.\n\nWhat\u2019s obvious, though, is this isn\u2019t really about near-term growth at all \u2014 rather the perception of growth. With UK businesses deeply gloomy about the consequences of Budget tax changes this year, it is little wonder the chancellor is grasping for any levers she can to get the endorphins going.\n\nnathalie.thomas@ft.com", "tag": "world-uk?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a71dc3c4-7139-4843-b0fc-2ff1cbf012f8"}, {"uuid4": "fdf55d8d-08b2-4553-81dc-49f5f7402fb5", "title": "Rachel Reeves urges Heathrow airport to fast-track third runway", "description": "Boss of hub calls timetable for expansion \u2018ambitious, but not undoable\u2019", "author": "Philip Georgiadis", "published_date": "2025-01-29T12:45:32.480Z", "content": "UK chancellor Rachel Reeves has urged Heathrow airport to fast-track proposals to build a third runway, in a much-trailed speech that sought to reinvigorate the Labour government\u2019s growth agenda.\n\nReeves said the government hoped to grant planning permission to Heathrow\u2019s expansion by the end of the current parliament in 2029, a target the airport\u2019s boss told the Financial Times was \u201cambitious, but not undoable\u201d.\n\nThe chancellor said expanding Heathrow would \u201cunlock further growth, boost investment, increase exports and make Britain more open and more connected\u201d in a speech on her plans to boost the flatlining UK economy.\n\n\u201cI can confirm today that this government supports a third runway at Heathrow and is inviting proposals to be brought forward by the summer,\u201d Reeves said.\n\nThomas Woldbye, chief executive of Heathrow, the UK\u2019s largest airport, told the FT he was confident the hub would put forward detailed proposals on that timeline. He added that the earliest the third runway could be completed would be the mid-2030s if everything went to plan.\n\n\u201cThe target is to have planning permission by the end of this parliament. That is ambitious, but not undoable, seen from our point of view,\u201d he said.\n\nWoldbye added: \u201cWe are standing on, if you like, a huge body of work that has been done in the past 10 years. If we didn\u2019t have that, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do that, because this is a huge and complicated project.\u201d\n\nHeathrow\u2019s pre-pandemic blueprint was for a multibillion-pound megaproject that would include diverting the M25 motorway into a tunnel to make room for the new runway. In the process, 750 homes and a primary school would be demolished.\n\nReeves said airport expansion was compatible with the government\u2019s legally binding net zero 2050 target, pointing to \u201ccleaner and greener flying\u201d through so-called sustainable aviation fuels.\n\nSir Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said he \u201cremained opposed\u201d to a new runway.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m simply not convinced that you can have hundreds of thousands of additional flights at Heathrow every year without a hugely damaging impact on our environment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe government\u2019s push for airport expansion has also alarmed local residents and environmental groups.\n\n\u201cInstead of picking up any old polluting project from the discard pile, the chancellor should focus on industries that can attract investment and bring wider economic and social benefits,\u201d said Greenpeace UK\u2019s policy director Doug Parr.\n\nExpansion plans at London\u2019s Gatwick and Luton airports are further ahead in the planning process than Heathrow. Transport secretary Heidi Alexander is expected to greenlight their proposals by spring.\n\nIn her speech in\u00a0Oxfordshire on Wednesday, Reeves stressed her determination to \u201cgrow the supply side of our economy\u201d, outlining a three-pillar approach built on stability, reform and investment.\n\n\u201cGrowth will not come without a fight, without a government willing to take the right decisions now to change our country\u2019s future for the better,\u201d she said.\n\nReeves also confirmed plans to make Oxford and Cambridge \u201cEurope\u2019s Silicon Valley\u201d, with new transport links between the university towns, as well as support for a proposed regeneration scheme around Manchester United\u2019s stadium at Old Trafford.\n\nBusiness leaders have previously criticised the Labour government for introducing measures that executives say will hit growth, including a\u00a0\u00a325bn national insurance increase on employers and new labour laws.\n\nReeves defended the tax rises as necessary given the government\u2019s fiscal inheritance and declined to answer a question on whether she was ruling out further taxes on businesses.\n\nReacting to the speech, Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturers\u2019 organisation Make UK, warned that the government\u00a0needed to resolve the contradiction\u00a0between\u00a0the Budget tax rises and the ambitions set out by the chancellor.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear contradiction between implementing laudable measures such as planning reform and infrastructure investment whilst, at the same time, applying a handbrake through measures which will inevitably reduce investment and freeze recruitment. This is a clear dichotomy that government needs to resolve internally,\u201d he said.\n\nThe chancellor also stood by Labour\u2019s flagship workers\u2019 rights package.\n\nThe measures could cost businesses up to \u00a35bn a year, according to the government\u2019s own analysis and have been heavily opposed by industry, but Reeves argued they would bolster growth.\n\n\u201cA secure workforce is a more confident, more productive workforce and also more confident to spend in the economy,\u201d she said.\n\nShe insisted that deputy prime minister Angela Rayner and business secretary Jonathan Reynolds have \u201cworked closely with business to understand their concerns\u201d, including on probation periods and the flexibility to take on workers during busy times, such as school holidays.\n\nIn a bid to reassure industry, she said the bill that the government takes through parliament \u201cwill reflect those concerns so that we get the balance right, supporting working people and supporting businesses\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by Peter Foster in London and Jennifer Williams in Manchester", "tag": "world-uk?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a48ef610-49e5-44f7-9a68-64f7d3edd920"}, {"uuid4": "171a43b7-97d1-4519-86f6-7d800b39d7e2", "title": "Changing UK\u2019s counterterror strategy comes with trade-offs and benefits", "description": "Separate bodies tasked with tackling specific ideologies can lead to twisted incentives", "author": "Georgina Quach", "published_date": "2025-01-29T09:39:14.146Z", "content": "Good morning. Rachel Reeves has a big speech today in which she will promise to go \u201cfurther and faster\u201d to increase UK economic growth. (Our story here.) However, I will wait until after the chancellor\u2019s address before giving my thoughts, as I prefer not to analyse speech extracts.\n\nThere is still more to be said about the government\u2019s options for tweaking our counterterrorism response following the Southport murders. One aspect of that was the subject of an urgent question in the House of Commons yesterday. So today, I want to talk about the benefits of keeping those changes within the walls of the UK\u2019s existing counterterrorism capabilities or as an extension to it.\n\nPrevent was established in the wake of the 2005 bombings in London, in which the perpetrators were all British-born. Its brief then was solely to focus on Islamist extremist terror, which makes up roughly 75 per cent of MI5\u2019s counterterrorism caseload in the UK. Since then, Prevent\u2019s remit has been expanded to include other forms of extremism, most importantly from a resource perspective the extreme far-right, which makes up almost all of the remainder of MI5\u2019s caseload.\n\nSome critics of the programme argue that this broadening of scope waters down Prevent\u2019s focus and thus its effectiveness. I think there\u2019s some truth in this, but there\u2019s a trade-off either way. One reason why I favour keeping all the extremist ideologies under one hat is that very few organisations advocate for their own abolition. As I\u2019ve written a lot lately, violent animal rights activists, who in the 2000s represented a serious threat both to the life of scientific researchers and to the ability of the UK to actually deliver scientific advances, have been pretty comprehensively routed by the British security services.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that violent animal rights activists are never going to re-enter the scene, but I am saying that, at present, they aren\u2019t a big threat in the UK. I think the nature of human affairs is that, if a separate part of the UK\u2019s counterterrorism apparatus were dealing with violent animal rights activists, they would be talking up this threat to ensure their continued relevance, engaging in turf wars with other bits of the security services and generally this would drain resources and time to no good end.\n\nSimilarly, a stripped down Prevent is not going to unlock greater time and resources to tackle the problem of people who support or commit acts of terror because they are Islamist extremists. It is going to spend that time having bureaucratic battles with whatever organisation you set up to address the problem of people who support or commit acts of terror because they are on the extreme right, the extreme left, and various other causes that are currently marginal in the UK.\n\nWe may not ever be able to comprehensively defeat either Islamist extremists or the extreme far right, as we currently have done to violent animal rights activists. But it is at least theoretically arguable we shouldn\u2019t create organisations that are incentivised to pretend that we have not prevailed.\n\nViolence for violence\u2019s sake, however, which typifies many spree killers and school shooters, and was the case for Axel Rudakubana, is a perennial policy problem. No state has a clear sense of how to stop that problem entirely and it may well simply be part of the human condition. A separate focus on those committing violent acts for their own sake wouldn\u2019t have the same risks of obsolescence later down the line \u2014 but would, of course, still be competing for resources.\n\nI had a lovely dinner last night courtesy of Martin Sandbu, but I did not, alas, have the presence of mind to ask for his recipe book.

Today let\u2019s talk about:\n\nJay Powell 1, Donald Trump 0.\n\nThe president did not get what he wanted from the US Federal Reserve chair yesterday. Jay Powell and his fellow central bank officials held interest rates steady, defying pressure from Donald Trump to slash borrowing costs.\n\nThe Fed kept its benchmark rate between 4.25 and 4.5 per cent and signalled it wouldn\u2019t be moving anytime soon: Powell said that rate-setters \u201cdo not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance\u201d.\n\nTrump was quick to express his displeasure with the decision and derided the central bank, which operates independently. He blamed Powell for inflation and said the Fed was too focused on diversity, equity and inclusion instead of high prices.\n\n\u201cBecause Jay Powell and the Fed failed to stop the problem they created with Inflation, I will do it by unleashing American Energy production, slashing Regulation, rebalancing International Trade, and reigniting American Manufacturing,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social soon after the rate announcement.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed had spent less time on DEI, gender ideology, \u2018green\u2019 energy, and fake climate change, Inflation would never have been a problem. Instead, we suffered from the worst Inflation in the History of our Country!\u201d\n\nPowell, however, refused to react to Trump\u2019s demands. During his press conference yesterday he stated that he was \u201cnot going to have any response or comment on what the president said\u201d. The new administration\u2019s policies were \u201cnot for us to criticise, or to praise\u201d, he added.\n\nCornell University professor Eswar Prasad told the FT\u2019s Claire Jones that this rate decision \u201cwill cue the political pressure\u201d, adding:\n\nTrump wants to destroy nuclear missiles with space lasers [free to read].\n\nHe made the proposal as part of an executive order that tasks his new defence secretary Pete Hegseth with coming up with a plan, in the next 60 days, to defend the US against missile attacks.\n\nTrump\u2019s idea includes building an air defence system over the US that he\u2019s dubbed the \u201cIron Dome for America\u201d, in a nod to Israel\u2019s renowned missile shield. But what he actually has in mind is more akin to Ronald Reagan\u2019s so-called Star Wars programme, launched in 1983 at the height of the cold war.\n\nThis Star Wars 2.0 fantasy would cost hundreds of billions of dollars \u2014 and face immense technological challenges. It also could provoke China and Russia to take countermeasures that would cancel out its effects.\n\nAnalysts say that a leakproof, space-based missile shield is all but impossible. \u201cThere is no magical security blanket,\u201d said Tom Karako, a leading missile expert at the CSIS think-tank in Washington.\n\nPlus, \u201cone cannot put active defences everywhere that would be needed to defend cities, critical infrastructure and military sites\u201d, Stacie Pettyjohn, of the Center for a New American Security think-tank, told me.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Iron Dome defends only small areas from short-range, low-flying and non-nuclear missiles. Trump\u2019s version seeks to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles that travel 100 times further and seven times faster. (The US is almost 450 times bigger than Israel.)\n\nHe wants it to deploy \u201cspace-based interceptors\u201d \u2014 a web of satellites, some equipped with lasers. But detecting, intercepting and destroying ballistic nuclear missiles during the three- to five-minute period before they enter orbit, would require laser beams effective over hundreds of kilometres.\n\nTechnology like that simply doesn\u2019t exist.", "tag": "us?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b5a32a95-d1c4-44d3-895a-ce9b4027c26c"}, {"uuid4": "8db78419-3a15-4683-9cd3-d2cb1e37eff3", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s administrative self-coup", "description": "A constitutional crisis looms after attempt to wrest power of the purse from Congress ", "author": "Martin Sandbu", "published_date": "2025-01-30T11:00:11.255Z", "content": "Greetings. Last week I asked for your ideas of possible \u201cgrey swans\u201d of Trumponomics 2.0, and you didn\u2019t disappoint. Your worries included huge costs from new pandemics, a \u201cwild spree of violence and revenge led by the just-pardoned criminals\u201d, Donald Trump\u2019s deteriorating mental health leading to him being replaced by JD Vance, an actual military grab for Greenland, and peace in Ukraine, the Middle East, or both. Oh, and a credit crisis for the US government.\n\nAll are huge but conceivable events, and the repercussions would be incalculable. But nobody \u2014 me included \u2014 predicted the sudden stops in government spending that have taken place since last week. Today\u2019s column offers some thoughts on that.\n\nWhen I say sudden, I mean sudden. First, Trump signed an executive order suspending all development aid for 90 days, with reviews determining what spending should be reinstated. Then the Office of Management and Budget announced an indefinite freeze on all federal grants and financial aid, with the exception of Medicare, social security and aid directly to individuals \u2014 but including all aid given through states, NGOs and so on. Naturally, chaos ensued, to the point where the administration U-turned, cancelling the across-the-board domestic grant freeze while pointedly reasserting the intention of aligning spending with Trump\u2019s Maga agenda.\n\nThe original sweeping instruction on federal spending was imprecise, got the numbers wrong (it said the federal government spent \u201cnearly $10tn\u201d in the 2024 fiscal year, while the true number is $6.75tn), and was wildly ideological. Here are some excerpts from the OMB\u2019s memo:\n\nDon\u2019t let the over-the-top silliness or the U-turn distract from the enormity of what was attempted. First, in sheer economic terms, chaos was guaranteed. Steve Bannon\u2019s call from eight years ago for a \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d is back on.\n\nAlready the foreign aid freeze (which remains in force, as far as I can tell) seems to have stopped a lot of programmes in their tracks, with many development agency staff apparently ordered to stop working. And hardly any work in international development will be unaffected, since the US is the rich world\u2019s largest donor of development aid \u2014 largely as a function of its huge economic size; it\u2019s near the bottom of the list on a per capita basis. (Secretary of state Marco Rubio has now also approved some exceptions from the foreign aid freeze for some humanitarian assistance.)\n\nThe effects of the domestic financial assistance \u201cpause\u201d were bigger and more chaotic still. Medicaid \u2014 providing the healthcare of nearly one-fifth of Americans \u2014 seems to have been affected. I am told universities and health research bodies were thrown into disarray. A federal judge immediately blocked part of the order. But the uncertainty remains, beyond the possible economic fallout.\n\nFor the second type of chaos that the Trump White House has plunged the nation into is a legal and constitutional crisis, and one that more of us should frankly have seen coming. Back in November, Matt Glassman of Georgetown University warned against \u201cpotentially the biggest executive threat to the separation of powers of them all\u201d. He was talking about violating the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, which makes it illegal for the president to simply refuse to spend money that Congress has appropriated. Shortly after the election, the newly announced heads of the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, wrote in the Wall Street Journal that Trump regarded the act as unconstitutional. There is no reason to see this week\u2019s backtracking as a change of mind, rather than a mere tactical retreat.\n\nThe federal spending freeze was, in other words, the opening salvo of a huge constitutional battle over the separation and balance of legal power in the US, in which Trump and his team are aiming to shift as much power from the legislative to the executive branch of government. That is of a piece with their support for the \u201cunitary executive\u201d theory which rejects limits on the president\u2019s authority over the entire executive branch.\n\nThird, and most important, is the political significance. A shift of power from the legislature to the executive, and a concentration of executive power in the president \u2014 what does that look like to you? I was struck by one sentence in the OMB memo in particular:\n\n\u201cCareer and political appointees in the Executive Branch have a duty to align Federal spending and action with the will of the American people as expressed through Presidential priorities.\u201d It also directed federal agencies to put political appointees in charge of ensuring that grants \u201cconform to Administration priorities\u201d.\n\nWhat if \u201cadministration priorities\u201d run counter to congressional ones? This conflict arises automatically in this case, where the presidential priority is not to spend money Congress has decided to spend. The memo could not be clearer about the answer: the will of the people is expressed through presidential priorities \u2014 not, then, those of the elected houses of Congress. The rule, in short, of one man.\n\nThe OMB memo did, to be fair, include this qualifier: \u201cto the extent permissible under applicable law\u201d. That extent will now be tested, and fought over, perhaps to destruction. For the stakes can hardly be exaggerated. This assault on both Congress\u2019s power of the purse and on the US\u2019s administrative state is as much of a self-coup as was the spurring of insurrectionists on January 6 2021.", "tag": "us?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a221a10a-5ac2-47b6-ba8b-30e18553c181"}, {"uuid4": "847dbb16-1d23-48f8-adf5-f1aa3f660558", "title": "The political cult of the entrepreneur", "description": "Is what\u2019s good for America\u2019s richest men also good for America?", "author": "Simon Kuper", "published_date": "2025-01-30T11:00:11.254Z", "content": "In our era, the meaning of any image depends which side you\u2019re on. Take the photograph of Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai sitting in front of cabinet members at Donald Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Caricature liberal elitists, like me, saw it as a portrait of American oligarchy. Trump, his supporters and the tech moguls themselves interpret the picture differently.\n\nTrump, a master of spectacle, put the billionaires there for a reason. His message: \u201cI\u2019ve brought them to heel and harnessed them to the American project.\u201d He knows most of his voters will approve. Maga is built more on the cult of the entrepreneur than on the cult of the strongman, though they overlap. Many businesspeople regard great entrepreneurs as the winners of life\u2019s game.\n\nTrump built his reputation playing a great entrepreneur on TV. He then went into politics selling the notion that government was a \u201cmalfunctioning corporation called the USA\u201d, to quote Gordon Gekko\u2019s \u201cGreed is good\u201d speech from the 1987 movie Wall Street. Trump promised to run government like a business. The Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris election was, among countless contrasts, entrepreneur against government official.\n\nTrumpism may represent the peak of the political cult of entrepreneurs. I can\u2019t think of another entrepreneur becoming head of government in a major economy, except Silvio Berlusconi. Past US political cults were attached to soldiers (Washington, Eisenhower) or to corporate bosses, such as Mitt Romney. George W Bush, who had a Harvard MBA, was hailed as a \u201cCEO president\u201d. But the corporate CEO is a rule-bound figure in a suit with degrees. The entrepreneur is a wilder beast, autonomous, rule-breaking, often a college dropout. He\u2019s his own man. (This is a male cult \u2014 recall Zuckerberg\u2019s recent praise of \u201cmasculine energy\u201d.)\n\nThe biggest entrepreneurial fortunes in history were coined in Silicon Valley between about 1998 and 2008. Today, the beneficiaries are middle aged. Their 80-hour workweeks are mostly over, leaving them with enough energy to pour into politics. They are known to ordinary Americans by their first names or nicknames, in Musk\u2019s case by his tweets, and by their anti-corporate dress. The billionaires relentlessly self-brand as iconoclasts, which can go wrong, as perhaps with Musk\u2019s apparent Nazi salute.\n\nUnderpinning the cult is the belief that what\u2019s good for entrepreneurs is good for America. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen told podcaster Joe Rogan that Trump\u2019s message, \u201cAmerica has to win\u201d, meant that US companies \u201cshould win global markets\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009How can anybody be against that?\u201d After all, Andreessen argued, only economic growth could pay for \u201cwelfare programmes and food assistance programmes, all these things\u201d.\n\nThe argument is dubious. First, Europeans retire earlier and live longer than Americans, despite lower economic growth and mostly lower governmental debt-to-GDP ratios. Second, growth doesn\u2019t necessarily boost public spending given that Big Tech has perfected tax avoidance. Nor do these companies create many jobs. Meta has 72,000 mostly high-skilled employees, including immigrants on H1-B visas.\n\nLast, how do the moguls \u2014 who spent decades ignoring Washington \u2014 read that photograph? In Andreessen\u2019s telling, Joe Biden forced them into Trump\u2019s arms. Whereas most ordinary Americans seem to have experienced Bidenism as a time of inflation and drift, the moguls saw something more sinister: a business-hating administration stamping out their freedoms. Andreessen accuses the Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission of \u201ctrying to kill the crypto industry\u201d.\n\nCrypto and AI are the entrepreneurs\u2019 new battlefields. One difference between Trump I and Trump II is that the price of bitcoin was $900 in 2016 and is more than $100,000 today, while we saw on Monday that shifts in AI can now turn global stock markets.\n\nOn crypto and AI, as on everything else, America is divided. Democrats are wary of crypto as a money-laundering opportunity. Trumpists see it as a libertarian business that subverts government (albeit that crypto entrepreneurs want bank accounts and Trump\u2019s support). Biden tried to regulate AI; Trump won\u2019t. Tech moguls hope he\u2019ll help them win what Peter Thiel calls the \u201cglobal war\u201d to conquer enemy territories such as the EU, the UK and Brazil.\n\nBillionaires care about policies, but they want love too. Several, like Andreessen, used to lean liberal. But if liberals reject you, you\u2019ll choose the guy who loves you (for now) and shows it with his seating plan.\n\nEmail Simon at simon.kuper@ft.com\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend Magazine on X and FT Weekend on Instagram", "tag": "us?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/bcb6adce-ac7a-4494-a837-d367ea873ccc"}, {"uuid4": "3b855b80-3389-445c-a425-953bd911e930", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s foreign aid freeze sparks global funding crisis", "description": "Dramatic repercussions have exposed reach of US assistance and soft power tools disparaged by the president", "author": "David Pilling", "published_date": "2025-01-30T11:00:11.212Z", "content": "With Colombian anti-narcotrafficking helicopters idle for want of fuel and news outlets in Ukraine threatened by closure, aid organisations and governments around the world are frantically trying to understand how the abrupt freeze of US foreign aid will affect their activities.\n\nThe 90-day suspension of US aid and \u201cstop-work\u201d requirement following US President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order last week has exposed with lightning-like intensity the global reach of US assistance, whose diverse projects worldwide have been an essential part of American soft power.\n\nThe new stance on foreign assistance could threaten that goodwill by putting countries on notice that there was no longer a \u201cdistinction between allies, partners and enemies\u201d, said Gyude Moore, a former Liberian public works minister and fellow at the Center for Global Development, a Washington think-tank. \u201cIt crystallises this idea that any engagement with the US is transactional.\u201d\n\nAfter a global outcry, Marco Rubio, US secretary of state, clarified on Tuesday that \u201ccore life-saving programmes\u201d related to medicine, food and shelter would be exempt from the suspension. Still, humanitarian organisations around the world were left trying to figure out how they would be affected. Yet more international programmes were threatened by Trump\u2019s shortlived federal budget suspension, which was scrapped on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged to hear that there is a waiver process for life saving programmes, but remain concerned that this could get caught up in bureaucratic red tape,\u201d said Elizabeth Hoffman, North America executive director at One, an organisation that campaigns for financing and debt relief for poor countries.\n\nBeatriz Grinsztejn, International Aids Society president, highlighted the threat to the US-backed President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, which has invested more than $110bn in HIV treatment since 2003 and is credited with saving millions of lives in Africa and elsewhere. \u201cPEPFAR provides life-saving antiretrovirals for more than 20mn people,\u201d she said. If funding is cut, \u201cpeople are going to die and HIV will resurge\u201d.\n\nThe State Department has not provided additional guidance since Rubio loosened some restrictions, according to a US official and the head of a humanitarian organisation. Many organisations had already received stop work orders and have implemented them absent\u00a0the additional information, rendering the waiver useless at this point, they said.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order questioned the rationale of much US assistance, which amounted to $64.7bn in 2023, according to ONE, more than a quarter of the $223bn provided by rich countries in that year.\n\nAccording to Trump\u2019s executive order, much US spending was \u201cantithetical to American values\u201d. Tammy Bruce, a state department spokeswoman, said the US was \u201cno longer going to blindly dole out money with no return for the American people\u201d.\n\nThe threat of abrupt withdrawal of swaths of US aid, even once the temporary ban is lifted, has also underlined the historic difference between Washington\u2019s assistance, with its emphasis on grants for health, development and human rights, and that of Beijing, whose main focus has been on loans for Chinese-built infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe rely heavily on the US for our funding and it is a very big headache,\u201d said an adviser to the government in Sierra Leone in west Africa, where US-funded Mpox monitoring and HIV testing immediately stopped following Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\n\u201cThe best-case scenario is to get funding elsewhere,\u201d said the adviser, part of whose salary is paid for by US aid, but indicated that China is unlikely to step fully into the breach.\n\nAmong the programmes immediately threatened, said officials, were relief efforts in Sudan, where nearly two years of civil war has unleashed arguably the world\u2019s worst humanitarian catastrophe, with about half the 49mn population on the verge of famine.\n\nAmjed Farid, a former special adviser to the civilian government, said vital communal kitchens relied exclusively on donor support.\n\n\u201cThe freeze on US funding now threatens to leave millions of Sudanese vulnerable to further suffering, starvation, and inadequate medical care,\u201d he said, although it was unclear whether Rubio\u2019s waiver might save such programmes.\n\nIn Ukraine, the world\u2019s biggest recipient of international assistance since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022, USAID has provided $2.6bn in humanitarian aid, $5bn in development assistance and more than $30bn in direct budget support.\n\nAlthough President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that US military assistance had not been stopped, dozens of Ukrainian entities, including news outlets, medical facilities and veterans organisations, have reported receiving \u201cstop work\u201d orders.\n\nMediarukh, a coalition of news outlets and watchdogs, said in a statement that the freeze would have an impact on the country\u2019s information space, which Russia has exploited during its war. \u201cIndependent Ukrainian media is one of the key elements that distinguishes us from [Vladimir] Putin\u2019s Russia,\u201d it said.\n\nColombia, which was due to receive about $380mn this year in development and counternarcotics funding, has been hit by the spending freeze.\n\nThe country has hosted around 2.8mn Venezuelan migrants, according to the International Organization for Migration, with many NGOs that provide shelter, food, and orientation now unable to pay for their operations.\n\n\u201cAll project activities associated with these sources of funding have been suspended,\u201d said an international NGO worker.\n\nEven several Colombian police operations financed by the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs were put on ice during Trump\u2019s separate federal budget suspension, which was later dropped. \u201cNarcotics, wildlife trafficking, flora trafficking, illegal mining, hydrocarbons, everything [was] affected,\u201d said the official.\n\nAid officials sought to present their programmes \u2014 whether in early-warning systems for the next pandemic or countering terrorism through youth projects \u2014 as contributing to US security in line with Trump\u2019s new \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy.\n\n\u201cPEPFAR is not just a global health programme, it\u2019s a cornerstone of US national security, protecting Americans from emerging health threats,\u201d said Hoffman of the One Campaign. \u201cOur adversaries will capitalise on this gap in US leadership and promote disinformation which will undermine trust in the US and damage our reputation around the world.\u201d\n\nIn Afghanistan, where\u00a0the US is the\u00a0largest humanitarian donor, the cuts threatened help for the women who have been erased from public life since the Taliban took over, especially young girls who still have some access to primary education.\n\nIn the long run, more threatened still may be programmes seen to run counter to Trump\u2019s orders to \u201cend \u2018wokeness\u2019\u201d and to stop the use of US taxpayer money to fund what the Office of Management and Budget called \u201cMarxist equity, transgenderism and green new deal social engineering\u201d.\n\nIn Lebanon, Bechara Samneh, a board member at Mosaic, which provides psychosocial support to LGBT+ people \u2014 among the few active organisations providing such a service \u2014 said it had long relied on foreign donors because of local unwillingness to fund the group.\n\nDuring the recent war, Mosaic provided shelter and emergency services for 400 displaced LGBT+ people. \u201cWhat does it mean for the LGBTQI+ community on the ground?\u201d Samneh said. \u201cIt means no services, no support, no emergency, no protection.\u201d\n\nStill, some policy advocates argued that, however unwelcome the prospective cuts were, they served as a reminder that many health and welfare systems overly depended on foreign aid.\n\n\u201cOur governments now know that help is coming from nowhere,\u201d said Ayoade Alakija, a global health specialist from Nigeria. \u201cThey need to start funding things themselves and investing in their own health and education.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Andres Schipani in New Delhi, Malaika Kanaaneh Tapper in Beirut and Felicia Schwartz in Washington\n\nData visualisation by Clara Murray", "tag":

"content": "The European Space Agency on Thursday put \u20ac862mn behind its goal to be a major player in lunar exploration, awarding a contract to Thales Alenia Space to build its first cargo vehicle for the Moon.\n\nDaniel Neuenschwander, the ESA\u2019s head of human and robotic exploration, said the deal to begin developing and building the robotic Argonaut lunar lander marked a major milestone in Europe\u2019s strategy to secure greater autonomy in space.\n\nIt comes as Europe prepares for possible changes to US space policy under President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIf Europe wants to play a substantial role in lunar exploration, it has to come with its own capabilities,\u201d Neuenschwander told the Financial Times. \u201cThe Argonaut is really Europe\u2019s autonomous and versatile access to the Moon.\u201d\n\nThe contract is also a big win for Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture that is 67 per cent owned by France\u2019s Thales and 33 per cent by Italy\u2019s Leonardo.\n\nThales Alenia Space fought off competition from Airbus to build the lunar descent element of the lander \u2014 in essence a space truck designed to carry 1.5 metric tonnes of cargo to the Moon.\n\nGermany\u2019s OHB will provide navigation control and communication elements.\n\nArgonaut is due to fly its first mission in about 2031, and is expected to carry cargo to the Moon roughly every two years after that.\n\nThe first mission, which is under discussion now, could involve delivery of navigation and telecommunication payloads, or energy generation and storage systems.\n\nArgonaut is meant not just to enhance Europe\u2019s independence in lunar exploration, but to take advantage of Nasa\u2019s flagship Artemis programme, which aims to land humans on the Moon by 2027.\n\nThe win \u201cmeans a lot to the company\u201d, Thales Alenia Space chief executive Herv\u00e9 Derrey said.\n\nFor Europe, he added, \u201cit can be seen as a precursor to a growing and improving technological capability, offering an important asset for transporting experiments and materials in support of lunar exploration missions\u201d.\n\nThales Alenia Space\u2019s facility in Turin has a long history of building space modules.\n\nIt has manufactured nearly half of the pressurised modules for the International Space Station, and is a key supplier on US and European space programmes.\n\nDerrey said exploration was \u201ca big growing market\u201d for his business. Thales Alenia Space in 2023 generated annual revenues of \u20ac2.2bn.\n\nThe Argonaut contract win is also good news for the joint venture\u2019s owners, who are contemplating a consolidation of certain space assets with Airbus amid a downturn in the market for big communication satellites.\n\nThe exploration market is booming partly because of rising global interest in putting humans on the Moon again, and potentially on Mars.\n\nNasa has encouraged significant private sector involvement in the Artemis programme to help cut exploration costs.\n\nOfficials at Nasa have repeatedly insisted the development of a so-called lunar economy will be key to ensuring the success of future exploration efforts, including a permanent human presence on the Moon.\n\nSeveral companies across the world are developing lunar landers to carry crew and cargo to the Moon as a result.\n\nAnalysys Mason, the space consultancy, estimated in its lunar market report published last summer that Moon missions between 2023 and 2033 could generate $151bn in revenues, three-quarters of which will be from government customers. Infrastructure and transport revenues were expected to account for roughly 43 per cent of that sum.\n\nNeuenschwander said the prime driver for the European lunar lander was to ensure autonomy and strengthen Europe\u2019s value as a partner.\n\nHowever, the lander would have to be competitive and, eventually, Argonaut would evolve to be reusable, he added.\n\nDerrey said landers carrying cargo to the Moon was an area where Europe could develop an advantage \u201cas no one has demonstrated the capability to safely land on the Moon for this particular need until now\u201d.\n\n\u201cEurope and European industries have all the technological capabilities required to compete in the lunar landing market,\u201d he added.", "tag": "us?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3963920e-afd7-407b-93e7-7a682917a234"}, {"uuid4": "9cddffa5-9266-4ec5-ae4d-60f721d3ec17", "title": "Monetary policy is a sideshow now", "description": "And day three of DeepSeekWeek", "author": "Robert Armstrong", "published_date": "2025-01-30T06:30:10.605Z", "content": "Good morning. OpenAI says it has found evidence that its proprietary model was used to train DeepSeek\u2019s revolutionary R1. But in the US-China artificial intelligence competition, do intellectual property rules apply? Should they? Unhedged doesn\u2019t remember there being much fuss about terms of service agreements during the Manhattan project or the space race. And, for the future of humanity, AI is supposed to be more important than either of those. Send us your thoughts: robert.armstrong@ft.com and aiden.reiter@ft.com.\n\nThe Federal Reserve held rates steady today \u2014 as expected \u2014 officially bringing its cutting cycle to a pause. At first, the wording of the official statement made it seem like the Fed\u2019s posture was more hawkish than the market expected. In December, the statement read \u201cinflation has made progress towards the committee\u2019s 2 per cent objective but remains elevated\u201d. This time, the statement omitted the \u201cprogress\u201d part. Yields on the two-year Treasury rose briefly:\n\nThey fell shortly after, when chair Jay Powell dismissed the wording concern and emphasised that the central bank thinks policy is sufficiently restrictive, and inflation should continue to fall.\n\nOther than that moment of miscommunication, it was a boring press conference. Powell did not give much on the big questions of the day \u2014 tariffs, immigration, tax, and quantitative tightening. The dullness reflected the fact that monetary policy has become less important as we inch closer to the inflation target.\n\nDonald Trump has been breathing down the Fed\u2019s neck. At Davos, the president said he would \u201cdemand that interest rates drop immediately\u201d. After yesterday\u2019s meeting, he posted the following on Truth Social:\n\nBeneath the invective, there might be a concession to reality here. Demanding the Fed cuts rates is self-defeating at best, and the Davos demand was not repeated. If Trump wants to change the rate environment, keep inflation low, or increase growth, he\u2019ll have to use other tools. The ball is squarely in his court.\n\nThe Fed has every reason to do nothing. The jobs market is healthy, the economy is growing, we just got two sideways inflation readings, and it seems like there is enough liquidity in the system for quantitative tightening to continue. Policy should remain where it is until more good inflation news comes in, or until the employment numbers show signs of weakness.\n\nMeanwhile, we know nothing about Trump\u2019s economic policy plans beyond some broad priorities, a few provocative actions, and a lot of hot rhetoric. Even if the Fed is starting to look at the risks posed by tariffs and deportations, as Powell has hinted it is, the strong economy means the central bank can afford to keep quiet and wait to see what develops. The same cannot be said of other central banks. The Bank of Canada cut rates earlier today and paused its quantitative tightening. Though tariffs were not the sole reason for the cut, governor Tiff Macklem was not shy about the potential impacts of Trump\u2019s trade policies. He spent most of his conference discussing how the BoC was factoring tariffs into its forecasts and preparing to help counter the negative impacts. That the BoC is more forthcoming is part politics, and part economic fundamentals: tariffs, in any form, will hurt Canada much more than the US.\n\nFiscal policy and monetary policy are always vying for top spot on the market\u2019s list of concerns. For now, there is little to see at the Fed. What the market needs is clarity on the fiscal front.\n\n(Reiter)\n\nOne occupational hazard of being a market analyst are the periodic, acutely uncomfortable moments when it looks like days of hard work amounted to a lot of pointless shouting into the void. Data gathered, correlations teased out, hypothesis formed, historical analogies marshalled, counterarguments tested, arguments made. Events can reduce it all to so much squawking.\n\nDay three of DeepSeekWeek had a distinct flavour of this futility. What have markets really learned? Much has been learned about AI from a technical point of view, of course. But the implications of these discoveries for the economy and corporate finance are, it must be admitted, still obscure. There is some consensus that Nvidia\u2019s competitive moat is a bit less wide than it was believed to be last week. For the rest of the Magnificent Seven, all of which have a lot at stake in the AI race, the implications of radically cheaper AI models are much less clear. Apple\u2019s strategy of not shooting tens of billions of dollars at the problems looks a little wiser now, but that\u2019s about it.\n\nThe impact on power providers is opaque, too. Of the three utilities hit hardest this week, two (Vistra and Constellation) made significant recoveries yesterday and all three are still up over the past month. Almost all of their AI-inspired gains are still in place.\n\nWe did get a smidgen of clarity last night, when Microsoft and Meta confirmed their huge capital expenditure budgets \u2014 driven by the need for compute capacity for AI \u2014 would remain vast in the near future. Meta said capital expenditure would grow 70 per cent in 2025, to as much as $65bn.\n\nStill, any recent insights into the most important trend in the most important sector in global stock markets seem very vulnerable to wholesale revision in the near term. Two familiar insights have been reinforced, however. Concentrated, expensive, and optimistic markets are sensitive beasts. Get used to short, sharp moves and countermoves, like the ones we\u2019ve seen in the past few days. And remember that AI is a technology that can surprise even its leading practitioners. Forecasts for how it is going to evolve should be treated with scepticism.\n\nBreit\u2019s blues.", "tag": "us?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9eba03c5-ee95-43c3-9ea1-749b6153dff2"}, {"uuid4": "c10d92b1-fabe-4f19-9c47-498257863f2c", "title": "Inside Trump\u2019s first strikes at Biden\u2019s climate legacy", "description": "Energy Source combed through the president\u2019s blizzard of executive orders on energy and climate", "author": "Amanda Chu", "published_date": "2025-01-30T05:00:10.860Z", "content": "Good morning and welcome back to Energy Source, coming to you from New York.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady yesterday, defying Donald Trump\u2019s calls for deep reductions. The Fed\u2019s pause on cuts is a setback for the renewable energy industry, which has struggled from high upfront costs and faces an uncertain future amid the US president\u2019s tariffs threats and restrictions to solar and wind development.\n\nToday\u2019s Energy Source takes a first look at Trump\u2019s efforts to unpick Joe Biden\u2019s climate and clean energy legacy during his first week in office.

Email me if there\u2019s something we missed at: amanda.chu@ft.com.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nAmanda\n\nOn his first day back in office, US President Donald Trump signed a blizzard of executive orders, bolstering the country\u2019s fossil fuel sector and launching his first strikes at Joe Biden\u2019s climate and industrial legacy.\n\nAn FT analysis released this morning found the new president has taken more than 70 actions to undo federal commitments, initiatives, and targets aimed at combating climate change, limiting oil and gas development, and spurring the renewable energy buildout.\n\nWe spent days combing through Trump\u2019s first week of executive orders related to energy and climate, as well as the dozens of executive orders and presidential memorandums he rescinded, which date back as early as 1977.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what we found \u2014 plus a complete list of Trump\u2019s rollbacks.\n\nTrump\u2019s first executive orders declared a \u201cnational energy emergency\u201d, committed the federal government to \u201cunleashing\u201d fossil fuel production, and reversed Biden-era restrictions on the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe most significant actions include ending the following: a ban on new offshore drilling, freezing new permits for liquefied natural gas terminals and a moratorium on leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Trump also reversed Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw the permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nTrump\u2019s easing of restrictions will support oil and gas production in the longer term, but the short term impacts will probably be muted as producers confront a bearish market and investor demands for returns.\n\nClimate activists said the moves delivered on the wishes of the fossil fuel executives who helped fund his campaign and undermine US efforts to tackle global warming.\n\n\u201cOil bosses have worked hand-in-glove with their friends in politics to bake dirty fossil fuels into our energy systems,\u201d said Alice Harrison, head of fossil fuels campaigning at Global Witness, adding this was happening when parts of Los Angeles had been razed to the ground by wildfires made worse by climate change.\n\nWhen Biden took office, he promised to put climate change at the centre of his presidency, committing the US to new decarbonisation targets and establishing offices across federal agencies focused on the issue.\n\nMany of these signature efforts were eliminated overnight by Trump, including targets to achieve a 100 per cent clean electricity sector by 2035 and make half of all US car sales electric by the end of the decade. Trump also terminated Biden directives to federal agencies to protect public health and the environment, prioritise climate change in foreign policy, and address climate-related financial risk.\n\nThe executive architecture established in the Biden administration to address climate change has also been dismantled, including the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, the National Climate Task Force, and councils to address environmental justice. Justice40, a Biden initiative to direct 40 per cent of green funds to disadvantaged communities, and the Civilian Climate Corps, another signature jobs programme, are gone.\n\nFor the clean energy industry, Trump\u2019s pauses on renewables development on federal land and new leases for offshore wind have created uncertainty for investors. \u201cEven a delay of necessary permits can be disastrous for a project,\u201d said Lauren Collins, a partner at Vinson & Elkins.\n\nTrump\u2019s first week in office marked the latest in the US retreat from international efforts to address climate change. In his executive order, \u201cPutting America First in International Environmental Agreements\u201d, the president pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement for the second time, as well as other commitments made under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees the international climate negotiations.\n\nFinancial commitments abroad have also been challenged. Trump called for the immediate cessation of financial commitments the US made under the UNFCCC and ended the US International Climate Finance Plan, a Biden initiative that multiplied the country\u2019s commitments to developing countries on climate mitigation and adaptation.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive overhaul highlights the legal fragility of Biden\u2019s climate legacy, which rested heavily on executive orders because of a deeply divided Congress.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not unusual for a new president to rescind executive orders from a prior administration, lawyers warned some of Trump\u2019s actions will probably run into legal challenges and pushback from Congress. Most at risk is his pause on disbursements of hundreds of billions of dollars in green funds appropriated by Congress from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, signature pillars of Biden\u2019s industrial agenda. Trump has already eliminated White House offices to co-ordinate the implementation of these laws at federal agencies.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s making it very difficult to implement, and he\u2019s trying to shut down the effectiveness of the programme,\u201d said Camille Pannu, a professor at Columbia Law School.\n\nThe limits of executive authority have protected the primary driver of investment in clean energy: tax credits. Whether Republicans in Congress will follow Trump\u2019s attacks on Biden\u2019s industrial policies will be seen in the budget reconciliation process, where the Republicans will be eager to slash spending to finance tax cuts.\n\nRepublican-controlled districts have overwhelmingly benefited from clean energy investment following the IRA, putting congressional Republicans in a tough spot.\n\nHarrison Fields, Trump\u2019s principal deputy press secretary, said the president won a \u201cdecisive mandate\u201d from the American people and is \u201cfully committed to investing in the priorities that voters overwhelmingly supported\u201d.

There is the automated robotic coffee-dispensing machine awaiting you when you first land at San Francisco airport and driverless cars ready to ferry you about. Now artificial-intelligence powered robots are entering our salons.\n\nAn Oakland-based start-up is offering $170 eyelash extensions by beauty bot, a sci-fi version of pampering that claims more precision and dexterity than a human, and \u2014 the key draw for a demographic that tends to fixate on productivity and \u201cgrowth mindsets\u201d \u2014 in a fraction of the time.\n\nMy first question naturally was \u2014 is it safe? The stakes involved (my eyes) seem high but the beauty assistant who oversees the process said that wands at the end of the robot\u2019s arms, held on by magnets, could be easily brushed away by customers. Plus the robot is able to pause if it detects that you\u2019re sneezing or twitching.\n\nStill, as I lay, claustrophobic beneath a hulking, whirring machine not unlike an MRI scanner, it was difficult to feel completely relaxed.\n\nLUUM\u2019s proprietary technology, which was six years in the making, is designed to use computer vision to identify a customer\u2019s individual eyelashes and rapidly glue false ones on top, taking a laborious two-hour manual process closer to the 60-minute mark.\n\nWhile techno-optimists tend to focus on the power of AI and robotics to shake up sectors such as defence and manufacturing, the multibillion-dollar beauty and cosmetics industry has quietly been identified as a lucrative target by a handful of AI robot entrepreneurs.\n\nClockwork, which offers $10, 10-minute robot manicures, has already rolled out around 20 machines in the US, including two in San Francisco. Massage bots are being developed by a start-up called Aescape. And tech executives like Esther Crawford, director of product at Meta, are proudly posting pictures of their robotically-applied extensions.\n\nSo I lay back on my robot bed as it slowly raised me towards a white light so blinding it made me wince, even with my eyes taped shut (typical lash extension protocol). This was not soothing. But still, I was offering my eyes to the AI gods! I was looking into the light! I was the future!\n\nExcept not quite. As I lay there expectantly I heard the robot arms swish about and then\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009silence. The assistant explained there had been a slight issue with a newly-replaced component but that she was just fixing it. Somewhat disconcerted, I tried to remain calm when the robot started up a second time. Shortly after, another awkward silence, followed by two voices speaking in hushed tones. They were, they said, just \u201creinitialising\u201d the robot.\n\nThird time lucky and the robot got to work. My concerns were quickly allayed by its deft work. There was a light pressure as it applied each lash but nothing alarming. The application didn\u2019t feel too different to my normal beauty appointments. After about 45 minutes, the assistant added a final few lashes by hand, a sort of tidying up she called the \u201cartistry\u201d process, and we were done.\n\nQuick, convenient and the eyelashes look the part. I\u2019m told a forthcoming iteration of the machine will do both eyes at once to make proceedings even faster. Still, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d return. Part of my desired salon experience is escapism. During human-led lash treatments I can listen to music or a soothing podcast, or take a delicious daytime nap. Although I came to trust my gentle beauty bot and its magic wands, it was hard to unwind while the machine whirred like a printer and shone operating room-style lights down at me.\n\nThese bugbears will eventually be worked through and, despite protestations to the contrary by start-up CEOs, aestheticians\u2019 jobs will be cut or forever altered. The male-dominated tech industry is starting to realise that this is a consumer industry of low-hanging fruit ripe for disruption.\n\nDespite this, the era of fully automated beauty treatments is still some way off. I was very grateful for the human presence \u2014 and reminded of it when I received a text noting that I could leave a gratuity for my lash procedure via cash or a payments app. Even AI robots can\u2019t displace America\u2019s tipping culture.\n\nhannah.murphy@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f98d6b2a-a804-4f89-96d8-90a1533cda1d"}, {"uuid4": "e1a381ea-ecb5-42d2-b537-6ec35cc98825", "title": "Donald Trump wiped out dozens of Joe Biden\u2019s climate initiatives in first-week blitz  ", "description": "President upended US efforts to combat climate change and accelerate clean energy development, according to FT analysis", "author": "Amanda Chu", "published_date": "2025-01-30T05:00:10.807Z", "content": "US President Donald Trump eliminated more than 70 climate and green energy initiatives in his first week of office, launching a sweeping and aggressive move to dismantle Joe Biden\u2019s climate and industrial legacy.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive orders upended federal commitments, initiatives and targets aimed at combating climate change, limiting oil and gas development and accelerating the clean energy buildout, a Financial Times analysis of the new president\u2019s first week of executive orders found.\n\nAmong the largest rescissions included ending the ban on new offshore drilling and removing the US from the Paris climate agreement and other commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The law transformed the country overnight into a top destination for clean energy investment, offering $370bn in federal incentives to support companies.\n\nWithin hours of taking office, Trump signed several executive orders to \u201cunleash\u201d the country\u2019s oil and gas production.\n\nThe FT tracked about a dozen Biden executive orders that have been entirely reversed, including orders to protect the environment, address climate-related financial risk, prioritise climate change in foreign policy, and strengthen the country\u2019s leadership in clean transport.\n\nThe rescissions ended a Biden administration pause on permits for liquefied natural gas terminals, lifted restrictions on Arctic drilling and reversed the withdrawal of a permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.\n\n\u201cMost of the rescissions\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009reflect just the 180-degree turn away from climate change as a governing priority towards one of, as the president describes it, energy dominance,\u201d said Chris Treanor, a partner at law firm Akin.\n\nClimate experts said many of Trump\u2019s orders match requests outlined in the American Petroleum Institute\u2019s five-point policy road map published before the election, including opening public lands and water to drilling and lifting a pause on approving new LNG terminals.\n\nMike Sommers, chief executive of API, said in an interview that its early lobbying work meant it was \u201cwell positioned\u201d to influence policy and it was now working hard to ensure its implementation.\n\nThe sweeping overhaul underscores the legal vulnerability of Biden\u2019s climate legacy, which relied on executive orders amid a deeply divided Congress. Lawyers say some Trump actions could spur legal challenges, particularly regarding a pause on hundreds of billions of green funds appropriated by Congress.\n\nJim Bowe, a partner at King & Spalding, warned that the pause could send a negative signal about the future use of federal policies to drive private investment.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to make it more difficult when a future administration actually wants to try to incentivise behaviour by providing government support to persuade people that government support will be durable.\u201d\n\n(The FT Trump Tracker on climate/energy actions is published here)", "tag": "us?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c76943c6-38e5-46e7-9a8b-58ab638ed04f"}, {"uuid4": "da65dc78-3bff-41c5-a663-3bedaf90240c", "title": "Former US senator Bob Menendez sentenced to 11 years in prison ", "description": "New Jersey Democrat found guilty in international bribe scheme to advance interests of Egypt and Qatar", "author": "Stefania Palma", "published_date": "2025-01-29T23:05:31.667Z", "content": "Former US senator Bob Menendez was sentenced to 11 years in prison for accepting gold bars, a Mercedes convertible and half a million dollars in cash to advance the interests of the governments of Egypt and Qatar.\n\nMenendez, 71, a New Jersey Democrat, was once the powerful chair of the Senate foreign relations committee.

At the same time, people close to the central bank told the Financial Times that its plans to issue billions of dollars of fresh government debt and special bonds threatened to burst a bubble that it said had formed in the market.\n\nThis month, the PBoC won a rare reprieve from the market after it announced it would cease its programme of treasury purchases indefinitely after five months. During that time, the central bank had bought a net $1tn worth of bonds, sending yields up slightly.\n\nBut analysts say the risk of a systemic financial event stemming from this purchasing Chinese government bonds is low, given the lack of parallels with Silicon Valley Bank. In 2023, SAB had put an abnormally large proportion of its assets into US Treasury bonds without hedging the interest rate exposure.\n\nIt was one of several US banks left sitting on big paper losses as the long-dated bonds they had bought and held without interest rate hedges fell in price, after the US Federal Reserve raised rates more than 5 per cent between 2022 and 2023. Bond yields move inversely to prices. This triggered a crisis as SVB\u2019s depositors \u2014 principally start-ups \u2014 were sophisticated clients with a need for cash.\n\nI think the concern over something similar to SVB should not be too high because, in China, the regulator and the government are always very proactive in stepping in to provide support to financial institutions,\u201d explains May Yan, head of Asia financials at UBS investment bank. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t wait for days for a bank run to occur.\n\n\u201cA bank run could happen at any time or, if you overinvest in low-rate assets, it becomes problematic when the central bank hikes rates rapidly,\u201d Yan notes. \u201cHowever, no one anticipates such a swift rate increase in China any time soon.\u201d\n\nThe other concern raised by Chinese authorities \u2014 that a massive bond issuance, as may be necessary for the government to launch a fiscal stimulus, could lead to a spike in yields \u2014 has also been dismissed by some economists.\n\n\u201cA huge amount of bond issuance will only be done if it mirrors a weak economy due to too high private savings,\u201d says Allan von Mehren, chief China economist at Danske Bank. \u201cThose savings need a home and bonds would be one of them \u2014 as is the case today.\u201d\n\nVon Mehren adds that, even in the case of a stronger economy, in which investors switch from bonds to equities, a big move downwards in bond prices would most likely be met with intervention from authorities \u201cto stabilise markets in that case\u201d.\n\nGlobal investors have largely brushed off the warnings from the PBoC and continued to hold Chinese government bonds as an investment, believing that their prices will rise more, sending yields further down.\n\n\u201cChinese bonds were among the standout performers in local emerging markets in 2024, rewarding holders with falling yields despite rising yields globally,\u201d points out Marcelo Assalin, head of William Blair Investment Management\u2019s emerging markets debt team.\u00a0There is still a case for Chinese bond yields to fall further given attractive real yields in higher duration bonds, the disinflationary path, and concerns around the potential for deflation.\u201d\n\nMark Evans, emerging markets fixed income portfolio manager at asset manager Ninety One, is also a holder. He says: \u201cWe have been overweight for some time and remain overweight\u201d. In his view, \u201creal rates remain attractive\u201d and bond prices have continued to rise despite an increased expectation of issuance to come.\n\nBut investors reject the idea that China\u2019s sovereign bond yields could decline all the way to 0 per cent, as Japan experienced in the past decade, cementing the risks of stagnant growth and deflationary pressures.\n\n\u201cWe expect Chinese government stimulus to be more aggressive and more effective in 2025, placing a floor on what are already low levels of yield on an absolute level,\u201d says Assalin.", "tag": "china?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/800b57e0-d730-44eb-aacf-6bac15799f4d"}, {"uuid4": "e10e8158-5a1d-4338-bca3-a0e211c2bdbd", "title": "China\u2019s manufacturing activity contracts for first time since September", "description": "Industrial profits fall for third year as US trade tensions cloud economic recovery  ", "author": "Thomas Hale", "published_date": "2025-01-27T04:23:08.639Z", "content": "China\u2019s manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in January, official data showed on Monday, in a sign of slowing momentum as the country prepares for the lunar new year holiday.\n\nThe country\u2019s official purchasing managers\u2019 index, a closely watched gauge amid a gloomy economic backdrop, came in at 49.1, below forecasts and the first contraction since September.

But much of that growth was thanks to industrial output and exports, which offset weakness in the property and retail sectors.\n\nBeijing unveiled measures in September to boost the stock market and lower mortgage rates and has previously encouraged state-owned enterprises to buy up unsold housing stock.

Moreover, we face an additional risk from China.\u201d\n\nBeijing claims Taiwan as part of its territory and threatens to annex it by force if Taipei resists unification indefinitely. Since China often includes commercial ships in military exercises and uses fishing vessels as militia to assert disputed maritime claims, Taiwanese officials fear Chinese-owned ships could be used as part of \u201cgreyzone\u201d operations that fall below the threshold of outright war.\n\nCameroon, Tanzania, Mongolia, Togo and Sierra Leone are among dozens of states that allow ship owners to register their ships without being domiciled in the country. Ship owners often choose such flags of convenience to avoid higher costs, stricter safety standards and more stringent oversight in their own nations.\n\nTaipei is focusing on those five countries because vessels from their flag register top the ranking of vessels found to have faulty documentation, by violating maritime safety or labour regulations or circumventing sanctions, according to the Tokyo MOU, a multilateral grouping for port state control in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nDue to opposition from Beijing, Taiwan is not a member of the Tokyo MOU but received the organisation\u2019s list of problematic ships \u201cthrough channels\u201d, one official said. It then \u201cwhittled down\u201d that list by selecting those with owners of a China background.\n\nThe Taiwanese government has marked 15 of the 52 ships as posing a threat to the country because they lingered in its territorial waters for 15 days or more over the past year. Among those, the vessel suspected of cutting the cable was defined as posing a \u201chigh threat\u201d, four others a \u201cmedium threat\u201d and 10 more \u201csome threat\u201d, according to the blacklist.\n\nOn Thursday, the coastguard boarded and inspected the Bao Shun, a 20-year-old Mongolia-flagged freighter owned by a Hong Kong-registered company, in what was the first use of the new regulatory approach.\n\nThe ship had been idling close to Taiwan for two months and is one of those identified as a medium threat. A person close to the Maritime and Port Bureau said that in the past the port regulator would only carry out spot checks of vessels coming into port.\n\nThe inspection did not turn up invalid documents, contraband cargo or cable-cutting equipment on board. But the coastguard instructed it to leave Taiwanese waters. As of Sunday, it was drifting 27 nautical miles outside Kaohsiung, the country\u2019s largest port. The owner of the Bao Shun could not be reached for comment.\n\nOn January 3, a subsea communications cable owned by a global telecoms consortium was severed just off the north coast of Taiwan. Taiwan\u2019s government identified the Cameroon-flagged freighter Shunxing39, which had been criss-crossing the area where several regional and transpacific cables land for at least a month, as the likely suspect.\n\nAccording to an FT analysis of tracking data from three different providers, the vessel\u2019s real name is Xing Shun 39 and it is registered in Tanzania, but it has used several different identities over the past year.\n\nIn the weeks before the incident, it alternated between two different maritime mobile service identities, or MMSI numbers, broadcast from its automatic identification system (AIS). Over the past year, it has appeared under three different names, for one of which it used three different spellings, and four different MMSIs. It also briefly assumed the identity of a separate ship.\n\n\u201cIn the normal, above-board shipping world, such deceptive practices would be unheard of, but it would be a common tactic to manipulate the AIS if you are doing something that you don\u2019t want to be seen,\u201d said Bridget Diakun, a maritime risk analyst at Lloyd\u2019s List, the London-based shipping information provider.\n\nThe owner of the Xing Shun 39 could not be reached for comment.\n\nTaiwanese national security officials said the number of ships meeting the criteria for \u201cshadow vessels\u201d that were operating in regional waters had ballooned over the past two years.\n\nAccording to Taiwan coastguard and port officials, the vessels mostly transport frozen food and miscellaneous small cargo, often relying on smaller shuttles that transfer the cargo at sea.\n\n\u201cTheir business model is to use the lowest cost possible by avoiding regular repairs and rarely going into port,\u201d one of the port officials said.\n\nAnalysts said those observations reflected a steep increase in shadow vessels globally.\n\n\u201cSince Russia started using the shadow fleet to ship oil in violation of sanctions, the barrier of respectability has been broken,\u201d said Elisabeth Braw, a maritime security expert at the Atlantic Council.\n\n\u201cRussia has shown that you can operate vessels in violation of international regulations without consequences,\u201d Braw said. \u201cOrdinarily when your vessel reaches retirement age, you pay to have it scrapped.

These \u201cA to H\u201d listings \u2014 from mainland China\u2019s \u201cA\u201d shares to Hong Kong \u2014 could raise as much as $20bn in new funds, said bankers.\n\nA replenished pipeline would mark a sharp pick-up in activity for Hong Kong, which has lost some high-profile international companies such as cosmetics company L\u2019Occitane and struggled to replace them.\n\nMany of the Chinese companies turning to Hong Kong have extensive overseas operations and want to raise funds outside the mainland, as Beijing tightens capital leaving the country. Geopolitical tensions between China and the US have made listings in New York, another common pathway for Chinese companies, far less appealing.\n\n\u201cThe Hong Kong market will bounce back this year\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and a big component of that will be A to H listings,\u201d said Kenneth Chow, managing director at Citi in Hong Kong. He added that Chinese secondary listings could account for as much as \u201ctwo-thirds\u201d of the total estimated $20bn of listings in Hong Kong in 2025.\n\nAmong the companies this year that have confirmed plans to set up secondary listings are pharmaceuticals producer Jiangsu Hengrui, which has a market capitalisation of $37bn, and soy sauce maker Foshan Haitian, valued at $32bn.\n\nCATL has yet to file papers to the Hong Kong stock exchange, but Morgan Stanley estimates it could raise up to $7.7bn \u2014 a move that has been complicated by its addition to a Pentagon list of companies with links to China\u2019s military.\n\nEven so, there are signs of a market eager for new listings. Chinese banks have offered to work on the CATL listing for underwriting fees of just 0.01 per cent, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts at Deloitte\u2019s capital market services group estimate that Hong Kong will have 80 initial and secondary listings this year, raising up to HK$150bn (US$19bn), mostly by Chinese companies. They would join household names that record much of their profit outside of the mainland, including BYD and Tencent.\n\nAn influx would also offer a shot in the arm to Hong Kong\u2019s reputation as an international business hub. More than $10bn in equity was raised, in primary and secondary listings, in the city last year, according to Dealogic. That marked an improvement on 2023\u2019s total of $6bn but fell far short of the record $51bn raised in IPOs in 2020 according to HKEX data. That bumper year was also driven by Chinese companies seeking listings outside the mainland.\n\nThe mainland Chinese securities regulator has further eased the path for companies to list in Hong Kong to help them expand internationally, including a recent pledge to \u201coptimise the filing system for overseas listing\u201d. Other Chinese companies have also given up their listings in New York in recent years, citing the high administrative burden and low turnover.\n\n\u201cWe expect the volume of listings, including those of A+H share offerings, to gain further momentum in 2025, as more leading companies from China and around the world use [the Hong Kong] platform to expand internationally,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Hong Kong stock exchange.\n\nAnalysts said US President Donald Trump\u2019s policy towards China could send more companies to the territory.\n\nMany Chinese companies were forced to delist from the US in the final days of Trump\u2019s first administration, when the president issued an executive order, citing fears of links to the Chinese military.\n\n\u201cGeopolitical uncertainties [could prompt] more Chinese companies and US-listed China concept stocks to turn to Hong Kong as their preferred overseas listing hub,\u201d Edward Au, southern region managing partner at Deloitte China, said in a report.\n\nIndustry executives said companies going to Hong Kong would hope to replicate the performance of Midea. The aircon maker raised about $5bn in an oversubscribed offering, and its shares are up 27 per cent since its September float.\n\nThat rate of growth is faster than its Chinese equivalent and narrowed the discount to its mainland shares. A company listed in mainland China typically trades at a premium to its Hong Kong counterpart of as much as 40 per cent, due to the mainland market\u2019s higher level of local retail participation.\n\nRegulators are closely watching the likely valuation of H shares and their discount to A shares. A capital markets banker in Hong Kong told the FT that he had had discussions with Chinese authorities about the potential valuation of H shares.\n\nAuthorities have focused on liquidity potentially leaving the country, which would devalue Chinese companies and encourage arbitrageurs looking to make a profit from the difference in prices between the two stocks.\n\nLarge-cap Chinese companies such as BYD tend to have a much smaller discount in Hong Kong, while smaller companies are relatively unloved outside the mainland.\n\n\u201cThe bigger challenge for our\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009projects is if we can narrow the discount between A and H shares even further,\u201d said one executive at a Chinese brokerage. \u201cWe also think that there is a high probability that there will be a further rebound [in activity] in 2025.\u201d\n\nThe executive said he expected about $20bn in fundraising this year but added that \u201cthis is purely our own estimate\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by Cheng Leng and data visualisation by Haohsiang Ko in Hong Kong", "tag": "china?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ef6e0d1d-2b00-4134-be2f-e9b09ad932e1"}, {"uuid4": "4c53c592-38c9-4c12-94e9-f37fa036dfaf", "title": "Meet three of Hong Kong\u2019s top female chefs", "description": "A trio of culinary stars are making their mark on a traditionally male-dominated restaurant scene", "author": "Steve King", "published_date": "2025-01-27T00:00:59.721Z", "content": "This article is part of FT Globetrotter\u2019s guide to Hong Kong\n\nAsk Michelle Garnaut, the pioneering Australian chef and restaurateur, how much the Hong Kong dining scene has evolved, particularly from the point of view of female chefs, since she opened M at the Fringe \u2014 the first independent fine-dining restaurant outside a hotel in the city \u2014 in 1989. You can expect by way of response a very wry, very worldly, very expressive snort. \u201cBack then, cooking wasn\u2019t even seen as a proper job,\u201d she says. \u201cVirtually no women were involved. I had one talented young female chef \u2014 a local \u2014 who quit to become a manager at KFC because her parents thought that any managerial role was more respectable than being a chef.\u201d\n\nIt took more than 20 years for such attitudes to change, Garnaut reckons. In that time a generational shift occurred, given impetus by the rise of social media. Successful chefs \u2014 mostly men but a growing number of women as well \u2014 became ever more visible. Then, in 2013, Vicky Lau was awarded her first Michelin star at Tate Dining Room. A second star followed in 2021.

She nudged the bao into burger territory, the burger into bao territory, showcasing the joys of each in the process \u2014 a remarkable achievement of Sino-American diplomacy.

The fillings\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009well, sometimes, as with the braised pork belly, they were familiar too; sometimes not so much, as with the chestnut tiramisu ice cream.\n\nThe Canadian-born Chow is outspoken in her support of diversity and LBGTQ+ rights. \u201cThe great thing about being a chef who is also an entrepreneur is that you can create your own culture,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen thrive in the right culture. And there\u2019s more than one way to be successful. Sure, you can be competitive, strong, decisive. But you don\u2019t have to be awful.\u201d This philosophy \u2014 the tao of Little Bao, as it were \u2014 resonates far beyond the restaurant scene. \u201cThe important thing is to recognise that we all have a choice,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe can choose better.

Where the restaurant of that name is concerned, both the literal and figurative associations are spot on. Everything about this beloved Elgin Street institution, which celebrates its 10th birthday this year (a ripe old age for a restaurant in Hong Kong), is contrived to amuse and delight, from the joyous decor (the famous wall of waving golden lucky cats) and the singalong soundtrack (nostalgic chart hits) to the sublimely executed menu (\u201cserious Cantonese food in a playful setting\u201d, as executive chef ArChan Chan puts it).\n\nThough she wears her seriousness lightly, make no mistake \u2014 here is a chef of exceptional ability and ambition, committed to honouring dishes she grew up on yet bold enough to tinker with them in ways that even diehard purists are compelled, however reluctantly, to admit just\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009works. Consider her take on stir-fry king, one of those all-time Hong Kong classics with which liberties are not, as a rule, taken. Chan blithely replaces the traditional squid with abalone and jettisons the conventional cashews in favour of peanut sprouts. The one introduces a new layer of luscious, richly textured opulence, the other an element of momentary, eyebrow-raising surprise that\u2019s swiftly followed by a \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone think of that before?\u201d sense of inevitability. The result is nothing less than a peaceful revolution between two chopsticks. Ho lee fook indeed.\n\nChan\u2019s arrival at Ho Lee Fook in 2021 was a homecoming after more than a decade in Australia and Singapore. The cosmopolitanism of her experience is reflected in the make-up of her brigade at Ho Lee Fook. English is the lingua franca. The design of the restaurant is such that they and their flaming woks are the first things you see when you arrive \u2014 the waving cats come next \u2014 and the collective good vibes are as thick in the air as the wok smoke. This impression of camaraderie surely starts at the top. Chan speaks of her four principles of respect, care, fairness and honesty: \u201cIt\u2019s an intense job.

There\u2019s more to it than spiciness,\u201d says Theign Phan, executive chef at the Grand Majestic Sichuan, a gleaming, jewel-toned, Gucci-wallpapered temple to one of China\u2019s most beloved regional cuisines.\n\nThough proud to be among the growing number of female chefs working at the highest level in Hong Kong, she is as wary of gender-based generalisations about the profession as she is of lazy stereotypes of Sichuan cuisine. \u201cWhen I grew up, I was taught to believe that you can do whatever you want, as long as you do it well,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to change the narrative.\u201d\n\nAs a Malaysian raised in Singapore, Phan sees herself, as the head of a Sichuan kitchen in a Hong Kong restaurant, not so much as an outsider but as a translator. There\u2019s something of the explorer about her too \u2014 an explorer thrilled by the things she\u2019s discovered and eager to divulge her findings with others. \u201cBecause there\u2019s so much to share,\u201d she says. \u201cDid you know there are no fewer than 24 distinct flavours in Sichuan cuisine?\u201d The sauce for bang bang chicken, for example, that infinitely moreish Sichuan staple of poached chicken and julienned cucumber, belongs, marvellously, to the \u201cstrange flavour\u201d category, which encompasses spicy, numbing, savoury, sweet, garlicky, sour and sesame flavours.\n\nPhan admits that there\u2019s a skill to ordering well in a Sichuan restaurant but insists that it\u2019s not difficult to pick up. It\u2019s all about managing contrasts of flavour and texture. You might, therefore, start with a cold appetiser such as smacked cucumber (garlicky, viscous, crunchy, watery), followed first by kung pao prawns with cashew nuts (an unlikely yet undeniably harmonious marriage of lychee flavour with hints of Sichuan peppercorn and chillies), and then by mapo tofu with beef (the slippery and jelly-like texture of the tofu offset by zingy-yet-earthy chilli-bean paste). Steamed rice is, of course, a constant throughout \u2014 the essential thread in the tapestry. And for pudding, perhaps the silver-ear fungus with chrysanthemum resin and rock-sugar soup (sweet, floral, faintly herbaceous and in every respect as intriguing as its name might lead you to expect).\n\nComplex? Certainly. Difficult? Not at all. Phan and the entire Grand Majestic team are on hand to advise. She sees it as their shared responsibility to make acquiring a taste for Sichuan cuisine easy and enjoyable \u2014 as well as potentially enlightening. \u201cNo pressure, all pleasure.\u201d Grand Majestic Sichuan, Alexandra House, Shop 301, Third Floor, 18 Chater Road, Central.

But it said it had \u201clow confidence in this judgment\u201d and would \u201ccontinue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information\u201d that could change its assessment.\n\nThe new assessment was made public just days after John Ratcliffe was sworn in as CIA director.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart news after he was confirmed as President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the intelligence agency, Ratcliffe said he believed that intelligence and common sense \u201cdictates that the origins of Covid was a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology\u201d and would ensure that \u201cthe public is aware that the agency [CIA] is going to get off the sidelines\u201d.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz said that those who had been \u201clabelled conspiracy theorists\u201d for saying Covid-19 was the result of a lab leak had been \u201cright all along\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stop the next pandemic if we don\u2019t understand how the last one happened!\u201d Waltz wrote on X.\n\nOne US official said Bill Burns, CIA head during the Biden administration, had told the CIA team assessing the evidence to take a position on the origin of Covid-19, but did not dictate the outcome.\n\nBurns\u2019 directive came as Jake Sullivan, who served as national security adviser, ordered the intelligence community to take another look at the origins of the pandemic as the Biden team prepared to leave office.\n\nThe US official stressed that the CIA had revised its assessment before Ratcliffe was sworn in as the new director.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said from the beginning that Covid likely originated in the Wuhan labs. Communist China covered it up and the liberal media covered for them,\u201d said Tom Cotton, the Republican head of the Senate intelligence committee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased the CIA concluded in the final days of the Biden administration that the lab-leak theory is the most plausible explanation of Covid\u2019s origins, and I commend Director Ratcliffe for fulfilling his promise to release this conclusion. Now, the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a plague on the world.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington said it strongly opposed the \u201cpoliticisation and stigmatisation of the source of the virus\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe so-called report of the United States, without any substantial evidence, concocts misleading conclusions, throws dirty water on China and engages in framing. It is still an old routine of political manipulation of tracing the source and has no credibility,\u201d the embassy said.\n\nThe new CIA assessment change comes just over one week after Trump held his first phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping since at least 2021. While many foreign policy experts had expected Trump to take a tough line on China \u2014 particularly over trade \u2014 in his first week in office, the president has so far held off taking any harsh measures against Beijing.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News this week, Trump said that while tariffs gave him \u201ctremendous power\u201d over China, he would \u201crather not have to use it\u201d.\n\nHe also signed an executive order postponing the deadline for the Chinese owner of TikTok to divest the popular video app to avoid a ban in the US.", "tag": "china?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9880273c-8517-4502-abf0-e667319ea6bd"}, {"uuid4": "1f4fe381-052a-46d8-8587-e18bae4ff8c2", "title": "How small Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley", "description": "Hedge fund billionaire Liang Wenfeng builds model on tight budget despite US attempt to halt China\u2019s high-tech ambitions", "author": "Eleanor Olcott", "published_date": "2025-01-24T23:00:50.769Z", "content": "A small Chinese artificial intelligence lab stunned the world this week by revealing the technical recipe for its cutting-edge model, turning its reclusive leader into a national hero who has defied US attempts to stop China\u2019s high-tech ambitions.\n\nDeepSeek, founded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, released its R1 model on Monday, explaining in a detailed paper how to build a large language model on a bootstrapped budget that can automatically learn and improve itself without human supervision.\n\nUS companies including OpenAI and Google DeepMind pioneered developments in reasoning models, a relatively new field of AI research that is attempting to make models match human cognitive capabilities. In December, the San Francisco-based OpenAI released the full version of its o1 model but kept its methods secret.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s R1 release sparked a frenzied debate in Silicon Valley about whether better resourced US AI companies, including Meta and Anthropic, can defend their technical edge.\n\nMeanwhile, Liang has become a focal point of national pride at home. This week, he was the only AI leader selected to attend a publicised meeting of entrepreneurs with the country\u2019s second-most powerful leader, Li Qiang. The entrepreneurs were told to \u201cconcentrate efforts to break through key core technologies.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Liang started buying thousands of Nvidia graphic processing units for his AI side project while running his quant trading fund High-Flyer. Industry insiders viewed it as the eccentric actions of a billionaire looking for a new hobby.\n\n\u201cWhen we first met him, he was this very nerdy guy with a terrible hairstyle talking about building a 10,000-chip cluster to train his own models. We didn\u2019t take him seriously,\u201d said one of Liang\u2019s business partners.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t articulate his vision other than saying: I want to build this, and it will be a game change. We thought this was only possible from giants like ByteDance and Alibaba,\u201d the person added.\n\nLiang\u2019s status as an outsider in the AI field was an unexpected source of strength. At High-Flyer, he built a fortune by using AI and algorithms to identify patterns that could affect stock prices. His team became adept at using Nvidia chips to make money trading stocks. In 2023, he launched DeepSeek, announcing his intention to develop human-level AI.\n\n\u201cLiang built an exceptional infrastructure team that really understands how the chips worked,\u201d said one founder at a rival LLM company. \u201cHe took his best people with him from the hedge fund to DeepSeek.\u201d\n\nAfter Washington banned Nvidia from exporting its most powerful chips to China, local AI companies have been forced to find innovative ways to maximise the computing power of a limited number of onshore chips \u2014 a problem Liang\u2019s team already knew how to solve.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek\u2019s engineers know how to unlock the potential of these GPUs, even if they are not state of the art,\u201d said one AI researcher close to the company.\n\nIndustry insiders say DeepSeek\u2019s singular focus on research makes it a dangerous competitor because it is willing to share its breakthroughs rather than protect them for commercial gains. DeepSeek has not raised money from outside funds or made significant moves to monetise its models.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek is run like the early days of DeepMind,\u201d said one AI investor in Beijing. \u201cIt is purely focused on research and engineering.\u201d\n\nLiang, who is personally involved in DeepSeek\u2019s research, uses proceeds from his hedge fund trading to pay top salaries for the best AI talent. Along with TikTok-owner ByteDance, DeepSeek is known for giving the highest remuneration available to AI engineers in China, with staff based in offices in Hangzhou and Beijing.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek\u2019s offices feel like a university campus for serious researchers,\u201d said the business partner. \u201cThe team believes in Liang\u2019s vision: to show the world that the Chinese can be creative and build something from zero.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek and High-Flyer did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLiang has styled DeepSeek as a uniquely \u201clocal\u201d company, staffed with PhDs from top Chinese schools, Peking, Tsinghua and Beihang universities rather than experts from US institutions.\n\nIn an interview with the domestic press last year, he said his core team \u201cdid not have people who returned from overseas. They are all local\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. We have to develop the top talent ourselves\u201d. DeepSeek\u2019s identity as a purely Chinese LLM company has won it plaudits at home.\n\nDeepSeek claimed it used just 2,048 Nvidia H800s and $5.6mn to train a model with 671bn parameters, a fraction of what OpenAI and Google spent to train comparably sized models.\n\nRitwik Gupta, AI policy researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, said DeepSeek\u2019s recent model releases demonstrate that \u201cthere is no moat when it comes to AI capabilities\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe first person to train models has to expend lots of resources to get there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the second mover can get there cheaper and more quickly.\u201d\n\nGupta added that China had a much larger talent pool of systems engineers than the US who understand how to get the best use of computing resources to train and run models more cheaply.\n\nIndustry insiders say that even though DeepSeek has shown impressive results with limited resources, it remains an open question whether it can continue to be competitive as the industry evolves. Returns at High-Flyer, its big backer, lagged behind in 2024, which one person close to Liang blamed on the founder\u2019s attention being mostly focused on DeepSeek.\n\nIts US rivals are not standing still. They are building mega \u201cclusters\u201d of Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell chips, creating the computing power that threatens to once again create a performance gap with Chinese rivals.\n\nThis week, OpenAI said it was creating a joint venture with Japan\u2019s SoftBank, dubbed Stargate, with plans to spend at least $100bn on AI infrastructure in the US. Elon Musk\u2019s xAI is massively expanding its Colossus supercomputer to contain more than 1mn GPUs to help train its Grok AI models.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek has one of the largest advanced computing clusters in China,\u201d said Liang\u2019s business partner. \u201cThey have enough capacity for now, but not much longer.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Wenjie Ding in Beijing\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nTechno-utopian thinking, not DeepSeek, is the threat / From Ewan Dunbar, Assistant Professor, Computational Linguistics, University of Toronto, ON, Canada", "tag": "china?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/747a7b11-dcba-4aa5-8d25-403f56216d7e"}, {"uuid4": "707ffa1e-a8f5-4603-ba89-3192a415b187", "title": "China unleashes record short-term funds ahead of lunar new year", "description": "Authorities try to pre-empt holiday cash crunch but shy from cut to reserve requirement ratio", "author": "Cheng Leng", "published_date": "2025-01-24T03:52:46.433Z", "content": "China\u2019s central bank has pumped a record amount of short-term funds into the financial system this week in an effort to pre-empt the cash crunch that usually accompanies the lunar new year holiday.\n\nAimed at smoothing seasonal turbulence, the total cash injection of Rmb2.2tn ($300bn) through the 14-day reserve repo \u2014 a short-term liquidity tool \u2014 comes as millions of residents prepare to travel home, settle tax bills and hand out cash-filled red envelopes.\n\nWhile these injections are commonly seen during the holiday period, the size of this week\u2019s operation has damped expectations of an imminent cut to banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratio, the level of funds that banks must hold in reserve.\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China has in recent months repeatedly said it would cut the ratio \u201cat an appropriate time\u201d as part of efforts to revive confidence in the economy. It has also changed its monetary policy stance from \u201cprudent\u201d to \u201cmoderately loose\u201d as it tries to spur growth.\n\nA cut in the reserve requirement ratio is widely seen as a substantial easing move aimed at boosting long-term credit.\n\n\u201cThe prospect for an RRR cut before the lunar new year now appears slim, given the current liquidity situation and the broader macroeconomic conditions,\u201d said Wang Qing, chief macroeconomic analyst at Golden Credit Rating.\n\n\u201cThe central bank had also front-loaded a significant amount of the medium-term liquidity into the market in December, leaving the system adequately supplied but not excessive.\u201d\n\nDelaying a cut reflects the PBoC\u2019s intricate balancing act, with the central bank keen to reserve use of its tools for what it anticipates to be a challenging year economically, said analysts. China\u2019s property market has been hit by a prolonged crisis, and companies are bracing themselves for the fallout of Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist policies.\n\nGiven the strong signal sent by an RRR cut and the limited space for the PBoC to trim it further, the central bank would want to \u201creserve some bullets for the signalling effect for later\u201d, said Xiaojia Zhi, chief China economist at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole. The average reserve requirement ratio at Chinese banks stands at 6.6 per cent.\n\nThe PBoC is expected to rely more on open market operations in 2025 to manage liquidity, instead of cuts to the benchmark policy rate or the RRR, said Lynn Song, chief economist for greater China at ING. \u201cSignificant headline moves on interest rates and the RRR are likely being reserved for a more suitable time.\u201d\n\nWith deflationary pressures mounting and the property sector still in deep distress, Beijing is trying to reflate the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Yet it also wants to avoid further renminbi weakness.\n\nThe offshore renminbi has been under strain, weakening 3 per cent against the dollar since Trump\u2019s presidential election victory in early November, while the tightly controlled onshore currency hovered around a 16-month low at the start of the year before rebounding recently.\n\nThe potential escalation of trade tensions between China and the US has heightened fears of capital outflows, limiting the PBoC\u2019s ability to lower rates.\n\n\u201cRecent pressure on the yuan rate will put constraints on the PBoC\u2019s monetary easing measures,\u201d according to an internal briefing memo this week from a state-owned bank seen by the Financial Times. \u201cThe central bank has also used subtle actions to temper market expectations of further easing at this stage.\u201d\n\nSince December, the central bank has set a strong daily reference rate for the renminbi, issued offshore bills and stopped buying government bonds. This suggests the PBoC is prioritising currency stability over other pro-growth targets, said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie.\n\n\u201cLast year, the PBoC adopted a strategy we called \u2018hang in there until the Fed blinks,\u2019\u201d said Hu. \u201cNow, with the yuan under pressure due to the strong dollar, the PBoC has to hang in there again until the dollar weakens. For now, yuan stability is the priority over other policy goals.\u201d\n\nStill, some analysts said they believed more substantial moves were on the horizon after the lunar new year holiday and that the PBoC had a choice of tools it could use.\n\n\u201cThere are a few that the PBoC could consider, including outright reverse repos of various tenors, net government bond purchases, as well as RRR cut,\u201d said Zhi of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.", "tag": "china?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8c05ed73-0658-4bf1-b1ff-e0d3519249f3"}, {"uuid4": "5f579b1b-d9a8-49c5-91a0-3d3030fda2ca", "title": "US export controls have forced Chinese tech companies to be more innovative", "description": "Cheaper models such as DeepSeek\u2019s are the result of China being pressured to adapt", "author": "Angela Zhang", "published_date": "2025-01-23T15:56:35.223Z", "content": "The writer is professor of law at the Gould School of Law, University of Southern California, and author of \u2018High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy\u2019\n\nLast month, a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek astonished the international tech community with its latest open-source artificial intelligence model. DeepSeek-V3 delivers a performance comparable to that of better-funded US rivals such as OpenAI. This week it impressed once again with R1, its foray into AI reasoning.\n\nDeepSeek is not a one-off. Since the middle of last year, Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance, Moonshot and 01.ai have been steadily narrowing the gap with US peers, matching their capabilities and surpassing them in cost efficiency.\n\nChina\u2019s achievements in efficiency are no accident. They are a direct response to the escalating export restrictions imposed by the US and its allies. By limiting China\u2019s access to advanced AI chips, the US has inadvertently spurred its innovation.\n\nTo reduce reliance on high-end chips from overseas, Chinese AI companies have experimented with novel approaches in algorithms, architecture and training strategies.\u00a0Many have embraced a \u201cmixture-of-experts\u201d approach, focusing on smaller AI models trained on specific data. These can deliver powerful results while reducing computing resources.\n\nDeepSeek-V3 embodies the success of this resourceful approach. According to its technical report, the model was trained using a data centre powered by Nvidia H800 GPUs \u2014 a less advanced chip than Nvidia\u2019s latest releases. Despite this, DeepSeek completed training in just two months at a cost of $5.5mn \u2014 a fraction of the sums reportedly spent by US companies such as OpenAI.\n\nDeepSeek has also drastically reduced inference costs, earning it the nickname the \u201cPinduoduo of AI\u201d, a reference to the cost-slashing business model of the popular Chinese discount ecommerce giant. This breakthrough has profound implications. It challenges the widely held assumption that cutting-edge AI requires vast amounts of computational power and many billions of dollars. DeepSeek demonstrates how software ingenuity can offset hardware constraints.\n\nIt also lays bare the limits of US export controls designed to slow China\u2019s AI progress. While these measures may deliver short-term disruptions, their impact diminishes over time as China innovates to adapt.\n\nThe inconvenient truth for US policymakers is that strict export controls have forced Chinese tech companies to become more self-reliant, spurring breakthroughs that might not have occurred otherwise.\n\nNot everyone agrees, however. Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank, contends that China would have advanced regardless of US restrictions.\n\nCertainly, the Chinese government has long aspired to make the country into an AI superpower. But its record in resource allocation is poor. State-led initiatives often result in inefficiency, corruption and waste \u2014 a reality starkly illustrated by high-profile scandals and slow progress in the country\u2019s semiconductor industry.\n\nWhat American AI restrictions inadvertently achieved was a powerful commercial incentive for China\u2019s private sector to step into the gap. And while the US often dominates in groundbreaking research, Chinese companies excel in execution, affordability and product diffusion. In ecommerce, electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries, they have demonstrated an impressive ability to scale up.\n\nThe rise of DeepSeek is a vivid reminder that constraints can fuel innovation.

The country added record capacity in wind, solar, and energy storage last year. Yet fossil fuel power generation also hit a new high. Economic growth and energy transitions don\u2019t always sit well together.\n\nDespite aggressive investments in renewables, China\u2019s power sector recorded a 1.5 per cent increase in thermal power output, primarily from coal, in its energy mix last year, according to official data. The increase in fossil fuel output reflects pressures from rising electricity demand, which has outpaced GDP growth for the fifth straight year.\n\nOne driver of this is artificial intelligence. AI is highly energy intensive and gets more so as models become more complex and widely deployed. Broader adoption of automation across industries, from logistics to manufacturing, is also increasing energy demand. The expansion of 5G networks, data centres and cloud computing to support this shift soaks up electricity. These energy-intensive sectors have become increasingly important for China as it builds up its position vis-\u00e0-vis its main strategic rival, the US.\n\nRapidly rising demand for electricity has boosted the shares of the country\u2019s coal companies for years, pushing the market value of the largest, China Shenhua Energy Company, to more than $100bn.\n\nThis year could mark a turning point. Analysts expect renewables to meet all new electricity demand in 2025, putting a lid on coal-fired power demand growth. While positive for the environment, it puts the fortunes of the country\u2019s coal giants at risk.\n\nPreviously, sustained investments in wind, solar and hydropower were undermined by a lack of adequate grid infrastructure. That showed in rising curtailment rates, a measure of potential renewable energy going unused due to grid constraints. Those hit 4 per cent for both solar and wind early last year.\n\nBut more than $800bn has been set aside for grid upgrades through 2030 \u2014 and it is about to start paying off. Grids that are upgraded to enhance transmission capacity and reduce energy loss should be able to unlock more renewable capacity. Last year, solar power capacity increased by about 50 per cent while wind power rose about a fifth.\n\nAs these upgrades come online, it is a good time for investors to shift their focus towards local renewable energy stocks. Shares of China Shenhua are down a tenth this year and trade just below 10 times forward earnings, a significant discount to its solar and wind peers.

Unless you are Mexico, Canada or China, you have the luxury of waiting until April 1 to really start worrying, because that\u2019s when the various reports Trump commissioned on trade and investment are due.\n\nWhat do we read into this timing and sequencing? Nothing, obviously. Nobody knows anything. The palace politics explanation is that the business-friendly advisers around Trump have deterred him from going for tariffs across the board straight away, but then taxes of between 10-25 per cent on a third of the US\u2019s imports aren\u2019t exactly what the American economy needs.\n\nBroad-based tariffs remain a clear and present danger and taxes on goods \u2014 from China in particular \u2014 could have global knock-on effects. Given weak Chinese domestic demand, a trade war might exacerbate the supposed China Shock 2.0, in which cheap exports of high-tech Chinese goods undercut manufacturers everywhere. Chinese exports diverted from the US by tariffs, the argument goes, will slosh around the global economy swamping advanced and emerging market economies alike. And if others start reacting with their own protectionist measures, could trade wars end up being Trump\u2019s most successful export?\n\nThe experience of Trump\u2019s first term suggests these concerns are serious but not necessarily cataclysmic. In some cases, the US market is less important than it looks. In others, trade will find a way to adapt. It\u2019s the risk of global recession, not the dislocation of supply chains, that is the real threat.\n\nEuropean policymakers are clearly terrified of Chinese imports and particularly electric vehicles (EVs). But the experience of the first Trump term should be somewhat reassuring when it comes to the diversion of Chinese goods from the US market. Simon Evenett and Fernando Mart\u00edn of the Global Trade Alert project calculate that US tariffs on imports from China resulted in just a net $2.8bn diversion in goods to the EU between 2018 and 2019 \u2014 which is small relative to the $46bn overall increase in Chinese goods exports to the EU between 2017 and 2019.\n\nEvenett and Mart\u00edn found that rather than diverting sales elsewhere, exporters hit by tariffs were often forced into \u201ctrade retrenchment\u201d, smaller economies of scale making them less efficient and hence uncompetitive in other markets. To be clear: retrenchment is not a good thing. It reduces efficiency and consumer choice. But it does also lessen the chance of major political conflict over trade.\n\nIn the specific case of EVs, the prospect of big increases in Chinese imports is genuine, with the EU already having imposed anti-subsidy duties to manage the flow. But the US isn\u2019t a major consideration here. There were hardly any imports of Chinese EVs to the US market even before former president Joe Biden imposed 100 per cent tariffs on them. Take-up has always been weak in the US, and by promising to remove Biden\u2019s tax credit for EVs, Trump will essentially remove US-based production and consumption from the global market. (Elon Musk, founder of Tesla, is fine with this: removing the credit consolidates Tesla\u2019s position in the US.)\n\nCertainly, there are substantive concerns about Chinese goods swamping other middle-income countries and governments have erected a series of anti-dumping walls against basic goods such as steel. But there\u2019s great reluctance, among Asian governments in particular, to practice large-scale protectionism. Countries like Malaysia have become highly skilled at positioning themselves in global supply chains and managing relationships with both the US and China.\n\n\u201cLike other emerging markets we have put some antidumping duties on imports from China, but generally only industrial inputs such as steel and polymers,\u201d Tengku Zafrul Aziz, Malaysia\u2019s trade minister, told me. \u201cEven if there\u2019s a major US-China trade dispute, we don\u2019t anticipate going to widescale protection.\u201d\n\nFor both advanced and middle-income countries, the prospect of Chinese goods being kept out of the US is an opportunity as well as a threat. The consultancy Oxford Economics calculates that the impact of a purely US-China trade conflict on other regions\u2019 exports will roughly net out \u2014 lower exports to China because of falling demand being compensated by higher sales in the US market to replace Chinese goods. Europe \u2014 which competes with China on selling machinery to the US \u2014 and Asian economies in particular will benefit.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, bilateral US-China trade dropped off sharply but overall global commerce survived until the Covid-19 shock. Chinese goods often found their way to the US via what the IMF calls \u201cconnector\u201d countries like Vietnam by adding an extra stage in the value chain. Trump wants to clamp down on such circumvention, but global supply chains can often innovate faster than policymakers can move.\n\nThe biggest risk to the global economy and trading system from a trade war isn\u2019t export diversion. Supply chains are flexible enough to survive a lot of jockeying for position. It\u2019s a sharp weakening in overall demand, perhaps from Trump crushing consumer spending by trying to eliminate the overall US trade deficit with tariffs, or from falling Chinese export sales adding to the woes of the country\u2019s struggling domestic economy. That would take a truly dramatic escalation in trade tensions to achieve. We\u2019re about to find out just how reckless Trump is and whether he wants to risk it.\n\nalan.beattie@ft.com", "tag": "china?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f05d8f52-7131-4cc8-bd8e-9b875b04a14f"}, {"uuid4": "534f0bee-3cfc-46fb-a4eb-b3d4d4a8b2e4", "title": "Polestar seeks new suppliers after US ban on Chinese software in electric vehicles", "description": "Carmaker backed by China\u2019s Geely maintains US growth strategy despite mounting uncertainty", "author": "Kana Inagaki", "published_date": "2025-01-22T20:31:57.531Z", "content": "Polestar, the electric-car maker backed by China\u2019s Geely, said it will seek new suppliers to get around a US government ban on Chinese software in new high tech vehicles.\n\nThe ban threatens Polestar\u2019s future in the US, but its chief executive Michael Lohscheller said the group would continue to expand in America despite the return of Donald Trump as president, who has vowed to revoke the country\u2019s electric vehicle \u201cmandates\u201d.\n\nLast week, the US commerce department finalised rules prohibiting the use of Chinese software and hardware for electric vehicles, shutting out cars made in China from the American market.\n\nPolestar was considering new non-Chinese suppliers for its EV software and other components Lohscheller said in an interview, adding the group had enough time to find a solution before the ban came into effect from its 2027 model year vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe have a manufacturing facility in the US.

A bid originating from a neutral south-east Asian nation with a highly regarded legal system was intended to reduce suspicions in Australia over Chinese acquisitions in sensitive industries, analysts say.\u00a0It is one of several strategies that Chinese corporations are using to adapt to a hostile world around them.\n\nUltimately, its attempt to raise its stake in Northern Minerals was blocked by an Australian government \u201cwary of allowing a foreign entity, especially one with strong links to the Chinese Communist party, to control a critical national resource\u201d, according to John Coyne, analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think-tank based in Canberra.\n\nBut Yuxiao Fund\u2019s use of Singapore hints at a much bigger and more complex geopolitical trend. An intensifying rivalry between China and the US-led west is driving a fragmentation in the world\u2019s economic order. Beijing, Washington, Brussels and other capitals have imposed a range of tariffs, export controls and other measures to protect their domestic markets and stymie competitors\u2019 technological progress.\n\nIn response, company executives and analysts say, Chinese corporations are setting up shop in a host of relatively non-aligned third countries, hoping they can bridge the increasingly hostile gap that divides China from the west.\n\nThe prime motivation behind shifting investment into these relatively insulated countries \u2014 which include Singapore, Vietnam, Ireland, Hungary and Mexico, among others \u2014 has been to circumvent protectionist measures imposed by western powers against China-based companies.\n\nChinese investment is pouring into such countries, according to figures provided exclusively to the FT by the Rhodium Group, a research provider.

They are larger, more sophisticated and have much more to offer to the countries that they operate in.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s emergence as an economic superpower over the past four decades has been propelled to a large degree by globalisation.\n\nOpen markets and free trade underpinned China\u2019s long export boom and helped facilitate huge transfers of capital, knowledge and technology from the west to Chinese companies.\n\nMany have gone on to become world leaders in their sectors: examples include BYD and CATL in electric vehicles and batteries, Huawei in telecoms and ByteDance in social media.\n\nFaced with imported goods that are a match for their domestic incumbents in quality terms, and growing more concerned about national security issues, western powers have cooled on globalisation.\n\nAccording to a recent IMF study, trade and investment between two distinct blocs \u2014 one centred on the US and the other on China \u2014 have declined by more than within those blocs, especially since the onset of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe so-called connector countries are seeking to insert themselves between the two and are \u201crapidly gaining importance and serving as a bridge\u201d, according to the IMF. Flows of trade with and investment in such countries have increased dramatically since the US, Europe and others began erecting trade barriers with China.\n\nFor Chinese companies, investing in such countries brings several advantages. One is access to large free trade areas with minimal tariffs and regulatory friction. Another is that domiciling in a new geography can allow Chinese companies to dilute or repurpose their identity, thus remaining below the trade flak flying between China and the US-led west, analysts say.\n\nSo marked is this behaviour in Singapore that it has earned a distinct name. \u201cSingapore-washing\u201d describes a process through which Chinese companies set up a subsidiary or reincorporate in the city state to mitigate the geopolitical risks and scrutiny often directed at China-based entities.\n\nChen Zhiwu, professor at the University of Hong Kong, says he is \u201calways impressed by human ingenuity when it comes to responding to the rise of deglobalisation forces\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs long as there are diverse political institutions among the nations on earth, some countries will try to offer a platform for globalised businesses to engage in cross-institutional arbitrage,\u201d he adds.\n\nPerhaps the best known example is Shein, the fast-fashion group currently seeking a public listing in either London or New York. It originated in 2008 in the eastern city of Nanjing and its supply chains, warehouses and inventory remain in China.\n\nBut in 2021 its enigmatic founder Sky Xu, who also goes by the names Xu Yangtian and Chris Xu, relocated himself and the company\u2019s headquarters to Singapore. Shein, valued at $66bn in its last private funding round, now defines itself as a \u201cSingapore-headquartered global online fashion and lifestyle retailer\u201d, according to its website.\n\nIt will still need approval from Chinese regulatory authorities ahead of its planned overseas listing, according to multiple people familiar with the situation. Beijing\u2019s powerful Cyberspace Administration of China is also reviewing whether there is a risk that some of Shein\u2019s data could fall into foreign hands.\n\nBut the company\u2019s customers, business partners and potential investors will look at Singapore and see a respected jurisdiction providing a transparent pathway towards legal redress if things go wrong, analysts say.\n\nSingaporean identities are also sometimes used to access the market in India, skirting New Delhi\u2019s clear antipathy towards Chinese investment. In a crackdown that started in 2020 after clashes between Chinese and Indian troops along their shared Himalayan border, India has banned more than a hundred Chinese social media, lending and other apps, citing data protection and privacy concerns. It has also launched several regulatory probes against Chinese tech companies.\n\nBut that has not stopped China\u2019s Shunwei Capital \u2014 established by Lei Jun, the founder of smartphone maker Xiaomi \u2014 investing in Indian market automation platform WebEngage and dairy brand Country Delight in 2022. Those deals were done through SWC Global, which describes itself as the Singapore \u201caffiliate of a leading multibillion venture capital firm based in Asia\u201d.\n\nJoyy, a US-listed tech business with roots in China, has also recast itself as a Singapore-based global company after establishing an entity in the city state in 2021, according to corporate filings.\n\n\u201cThere is a track record of Singapore becoming a cover for companies with questionable ties to China and even the Chinese state,\u201d says Ja-Ian Chong, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore and a non-resident scholar with Carnegie China.\n\nChina also has reservations about Singapore-washing. One senior Chinese official, who declined to be identified, says Beijing felt a sense of discomfort with the trend among certain Chinese companies to \u201cde-Chinafy\u201d when they set up offices overseas. \u201cIt raises questions of loyalty to China that some in Beijing find uncomfortable,\u201d the person says.\n\nShein declined to comment.\n\nChong believes such concerns are mirrored in Singapore. \u201cIf there is an accumulation of such cases, especially companies with [Chinese Communist party] ties using Singapore\u2019s preferential arrangements with other countries, or increasingly using their entities here to circumvent restrictions, this could end up with negative speculation and political risks for Singapore,\u201d he says.\n\nJinan Yuxiao Group is a case in point. It has equity affiliations with the state-owned Chinese miner Shenghe Resources, says Mary Hui, a Hong Kong-based researcher on China\u2019s industrial strategies and author of the a/symmetric newsletter.\n\nAs well as having stable relations with both China and the west, many of the group of third countries also tend to be members of free trade areas that guarantee access to large western markets at zero or low tariffs.\n\nSingapore and Vietnam are both members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a grouping of 15 Asia-Pacific countries that accounts for around 30 per cent of the world\u2019s GDP. In addition, both have long-standing bilateral free trade agreements with the US.\n\n\u201cSetting up in Singapore has a whole range of benefits for a Chinese company,\u201d says the vice-president of one Singapore-based Chinese technology company, who declined to be further identified.\n\n\u201cIf we do business from China, we hit a wall of tariffs and suspicion over everything we want to do in the US market,\u201d the executive adds. \u201cFrom Singapore, there are no tariffs and the suspicion is much less.\u201d\n\nSimilar considerations apply to Ireland and Hungary. Both are members of the EU, whose single market provides regulatory unity and zero tariffs across 27 member states and 450mn people. Tariffs imposed by the bloc on products imported from China do not apply if those same products are manufactured and sold inside the EU.\n\nIreland\u2019s experience shows the clear commercial dividends that a country can reap from linking China and the west.\n\nBilateral trade with China has tripled in the past five years and there is a clear desire on both sides to increase investment, said Ireland\u2019s then-prime minister Leo Varadkar as he welcomed his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang on a visit early this year.\n\nBig-ticket Chinese investments in Ireland include those from ByteDance, parent of the short form video app TikTok, WuXi Biologics, a drug company, Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment giant, and the Bank of China, a big Chinese state-owned bank. In total around 40 Chinese companies employing 5,100 people are clients of Ireland\u2019s investment promotion agency IDA.\n\nIDA executives say the agency \u201cdefinitely considers\u201d TikTok to be a Chinese company. But TikTok itself is at pains to stress its non-Chinese credentials.\u00a0Its spokespeople in Ireland said that the company\u2019s international headquarters are in Singapore, while in Europe it is incorporated in the UK and Ireland and is subject to UK, Irish and EU laws, not Chinese ones.\n\nThey added that although ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing, remains TikTok\u2019s parent, about 60 per cent of ByteDance is beneficially owned by global institutional investors such as the Carlyle Group, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group.\n\nWuXi Biologics said it \u201cwould prefer not to participate in a story focused specifically\u201d on its country of origin. \u201cWe believe our impact is most accurately reflected as part of the collective achievements within Ireland\u2019s vibrant life sciences sector,\u201d the company added.\n\nHungary, another key country for Chinese investment in Europe, has notably warmer relations with Beijing than many others. On a visit to Budapest earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping described bilateral ties as being \u201cas mellow and rich as Tokaji,\u201d referring to a Hungarian dessert wine.\n\nHungary\u2019s authoritarian president Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the EU\u2019s longest-serving head of government, praised China for loving peace and being an \u201cimportant stabilising force\u201d in the world.\n\nHungary received 44 per cent of all Chinese foreign direct investment in Europe in 2023, overtaking the \u2018big three\u2019 economies of Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by Berlin-based think-tank Merics.\n\nMexico is a member of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the successor to Nafta, which embraces 510mn people and accounts for another 30 per cent of the global economy.\n\nChinese companies have quietly gained a considerable foothold as investors in Mexico over recent decades. North America\u2019s USMCA free trade agreement means Chinese businesses making everything from fridges and televisions to textiles in Mexico gain privileged US market access.\n\nAm\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, the telecoms group controlled by the billionaire Carlos Slim, relies heavily on Huawei technology. Mexican appliance and refrigerator manufacturer Mabe is 48 per cent owned by the acquisitive Chinese group Haier.\n\nOne in five cars purchased in Mexico last year was made in China, with half of those coming from Chinese manufacturers. Electric-vehicle makers such as BYD and Chery are now scouting Mexico for factory sites so they can export to the US and avoid tariffs on vehicles imported to the US from China, which rose to 100 per cent at the start of August.\n\nHowever, US patience with Mexico\u2019s role as a tariff-free staging area for Chinese companies to the US market is already running thin. The US Trade Representative, which oversees America\u2019s trade policy and negotiations, has also scolded Mexico over a lack of transparency in its steel and aluminium imports from third countries like China.\n\nBut some in Mexico City say China is too deeply embedded in Mexico to change course. In any case, there is only so much either country can do to limit China\u2019s reach.\n\n\u201cIn Washington they\u2019ve only just realised,\u201d says Enrique Dussel Peters, director of the Center for Chinese-Mexican Studies at UNAM, the National Autonomous University of Mexico. \u201cThey think the discussion is: \u2018on Monday I don\u2019t want to see China in Mexico\u2019.\n\n\u201cThat was maybe an option 20 years ago. Today it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Kaye Wiggins in Hong Kong\n\nData visualisation by Keith Fray", "tag": "singapore?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5583db36-5141-413f-9687-2c3f4968ff07"}, {"uuid4": "e63ddd24-c5ae-4ac9-9545-6173b7be4dc8", "title": "Singapore tries to shore up disillusioned middle class before election", "description": "Prime Minister Lawrence Wong grapples with cost of living pains in post-Lee future", "author": "Chris Wright", "published_date": "2024-08-29T04:00:26.859Z", "content": "Singapore\u2019s National Day rally is traditionally an opportunity for the prime minister to outline domestic policy plans, but Lawrence Wong this year used his first address to sound an uncharacteristically ominous tone.\n\n\u201cWe have seen what happens in other countries when the broad middle falls behind,\u201d said Wong, who took office in May as Singapore\u2019s fourth prime minister and only the second not from the founding Lee family. \u201cThe centre does not hold. Societies begin to fracture and collapse.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not assume this cannot happen here,\u201d he added. \u201cIt can \u2014 and it will \u2014 unless we take decisive actions to prevent it.\u201d\n\nWong\u2019s warning this month reflected the government\u2019s concerns about the political implications of rising living costs ahead of an election that must take place by November 2025 and will initiate a post-Lee political era.\n\nThe increased disillusionment of Singapore\u2019s middle class, under pressure from high housing prices, threatens the fragile consensus that has underpinned the city-state\u2019s growth and stability for decades, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe top is not very big, but the middle is huge here,\u201d said Gillian Koh at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Institute of Policy Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s core to [the government]\u2019s interests to ensure there is a broad, strong, healthy, stable middle class.\u201d\n\nEconomic sentiment has dominated public opinion. According to the latest quarterly survey in June by local pollster Blackbox Research, 52 per cent of respondents said cost of living was the issue that mattered most, followed by salaries and wages, at 16 per cent. Immigration, often a hot-button political issue in the city-state of 6mn, came in at just 5 per cent.\n\nSingapore is generally lauded as an economic success. It ranks fifth in the world in GDP per head, according to the IMF, trailing the likes of Luxembourg and Switzerland. And despite Singapore\u2019s free-market reputation, more than 80 per cent of its resident population lives in public housing, according to government figures.\n\nBut not everyone has kept pace with rising prosperity. \u201cNobody in Singapore is going to die of hunger, but there are food insecurities,\u201d said Robin Lee, chief executive of charity Food from the Heart, which in 2023 fed about 60,000 low-income individuals. \u201cIt is shocking for some people that in a country like Singapore we still have to do this.\u201d\n\nHeading into an election, \u201cdefinitely cost of living hangs in the mind\u201d, he said. \u201cIt is really, really high, and even though wages are also high, it\u2019s relative.\u201d\n\nSingapore\u2019s ruling People\u2019s Action party \u2014 which has governed the tightly controlled country continuously since 1959 \u2014 is battling these economic challenges as it faces falling vote shares, including in the 2020 election, when the opposition made significant inroads.\n\nThe PAP\u2019s dominance is such that even the opposition Workers\u2019 party bridles at the suggestion of winning power. Its leader, Pritam Singh, demanded a correction to an April article in the Straits Times that suggested his party aspired to form a government, clarifying that its medium-term goal was merely to \u201cplay our part in ensuring at least one-third of parliament is not in the PAP\u2019s hands\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe WP seeks an evolution, not a revolution of our political system,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the PAP all but certain to prevail in the polls \u2014 and Wong to remain prime minister \u2014 he faces the challenge of winning over a disenchanted electorate following a transition from the Lees.\n\nWong was tapped by the party after Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, stepped down as prime minister in May, having led the city-state since 2004. Lee Hsien Loong has stayed on in government as a senior minister and secretary-general of the PAP, following his father\u2019s example.\n\nWong, who was principal private secretary to Lee Hsien Loong before holding a host of ministerial appointments, has highlighted his ordinary-man credentials, often referencing his non-elite schooling, in a bid to appeal to ordinary Singaporeans.\n\nHis rally speech included a series of handouts and populist pledges, including support for unemployed people to study or reskill, policies to maintain the affordability of public housing, improved shared parental leave and upskilling allowances covering 24 months of full-time training for Singaporeans aged 40 and above.\n\nThe 2024 budget announced in February also includes a S$1.9bn (US$1.5bn) expansion of the government\u2019s cost of living adjustment system of vouchers, cash payouts and rebates.\n\nWong\u2019s government has also pledged to develop an Islamic studies institute to support Muslim leaders and another to improve standards of spoken Mandarin \u2014 initiatives that reflect attention to maintaining harmony among Singapore\u2019s multi-ethnic population, which is 15 per cent Malay, 7.6 per cent Indian and 75 per cent Chinese.\n\nWith a severe reliance on imports, Singapore has limited scope to reduce costs, but recent economic data has pointed to a brightening picture. Core annual inflation in July fell to 2.5 per cent, the lowest level in more than two years, while non-oil exports grew 15.7 per cent year on year, the first annual climb since January.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore, which Wong chaired until May, has maintained the currency\u2019s strength around 10-year highs against the US dollar, partly to keep down the cost of imported goods.\n\nThis focus on affordability, more than tensions over foreign workers or balancing US-China geopolitical frictions, appears to be an imperative for Wong. \u201cIt is something the government needs to address very carefully,\u201d said Robin Lee of Food from the Heart.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nAll Singaporeans benefit from the nation\u2019s progress\u00a0/\u00a0From Ng Teck Hean, High Commissioner, Republic of Singapore, London SW1, UK", "tag": "singapore?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/69ff807f-fe62-4641-8ca1-e1a0b059cf0c"}, {"uuid4": "e99bd267-78c8-4319-9f35-5e35e5848bb0", "title": "Singapore PM warns of regional fallout from US-China tensions", "description": "Lawrence Wong says \u2018intensifying rivalry\u2019 between Beijing and Washington is his nation\u2019s biggest concern", "author": "Chris Wright", "published_date": "2024-08-18T15:30:13.337Z", "content": "Singapore\u2019s prime minister has warned that raising tensions between the US and China will have an impact on the city state\u2019s economy and the broader region.\n\nLawrence Wong, who took office in May, said on Sunday in a national address that the \u201cintensifying rivalry\u201d between Washington and Beijing was Singapore\u2019s single biggest geopolitical concern.\n\n\u201cThe mutual suspicion and distrust will continue\u201d, affecting international trade, security and co-operation, he said. \u201cAs a small country, totally reliant on trade and a stable global environment, we are bound to be impacted.\u201d\n\nSingapore\u2019s trade-to-GDP ratio stood at 311 per cent in 2023, one of the highest figures in the world, according to the World Bank.\n\nWong said irrespective of who won the November presidential election in the US, \u201cit\u2019s clear that America\u2019s attitude towards China is hardening. Meanwhile, China is convinced that America is trying to contain it and suppress its rise.\u201d Both the Trump and Biden administrations have ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese products, which Beijing responded to with countermeasures.\n\nThe US provides much of Singapore\u2019s military capability, while China is the city state\u2019s biggest trading partner. Maintaining good relations with both is a priority for Singapore, but also an increasing challenge.\n\nWong also warned of a changing global manufacturing map. Where once developed countries outsourced production to cheaper locations in Asia, \u201cthat era is over\u201d, he said, noting that the US, China and European countries wished to reshape supply chains in their favour.\n\nThe US and EU have both sought to reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains, favouring nearshoring strategies: in 2023 the US bought more goods from Mexico than China for the first time in 20 years, according to the US Department of Commerce.\n\nSingapore, the world\u2019s largest transshipment hub, has not yet seen an impact on its own role in trade \u2014 total container volumes in the first five months of the year were up 7.7 per cent year on year, according to the Maritime & Port Authority of Singapore \u2014 but the country is potentially vulnerable to supply chain realignment.\n\nThe National Day Rally speech is considered the country\u2019s most significant annual political event, usually accompanied by domestic policy initiatives. Not only was this Wong\u2019s first such address as prime minister, but it was likely to be the last before Singapore holds a general election, which must take place before November 2025, but is widely expected to be held earlier.\n\nSpeaking in Malay, Mandarin and English Wong focused on policies concerning education, families and public housing availability. He highlighted the need to keep Singapore\u2019s multi-ethnic population cohesive and financially included.\n\n\u201cWe have seen what happens in other countries when the broad middle falls behind: societies begin to fracture and collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not assume this cannot happen here.

It ranked fifth in 2021.\n\nThis year\u2019s parade, the first under new Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, takes place as rising geopolitical tensions and emerging cyber threats are pushing the city state to boost defence spending and rethink its traditional stance of preparation and deterrence.\n\nOn National Day, Wong warned that \u201ctensions between the US and China continue to rise. For now, they don\u2019t want to collide. But they are engaged in a strategic rivalry that can undermine peace\u00a0and stability, especially in this region.\u201d These were, he said, \u201cpowerful forces\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey are what keep me awake at night,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA lot more can be done in hardening civilian systems and getting the population psychologically ready for disruption in case Singapore gets caught up in a power confrontation,\u201d said Ja Ian Chong, associate professor at the National University of Singapore.\n\nSingapore\u2019s military strategy has long been encapsulated by founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s remark in 1966 that the city state should be a \u201cpoisonous shrimp\u201d \u2014 small but hazardous for predators.\n\n\u201cUltimately Singapore is trying to deter coercion directed against the city-state, without really trying to project power very far outwards,\u201d said Scott Harold, associate director of the Rand Corporation.\n\nIn a sign of an increased focus on defence, Singapore in February outlined a S$20.25bn (US$15bn) defence budget for the current fiscal year. That is a 13 per cent increase over the previous annual budget, although revisions in last year\u2019s spending means the actual increase is 2.5 per cent. In 2014, the budget was S$12.6bn.\n\nSingapore has long sought to maintain friendly relations with both the US, an important non-treaty ally, and China, its largest trading partner. But that geopolitical balancing act is being tested in an increasingly fractious environment.\n\nOne proximate source of concern is the South China Sea, where China has made vast maritime claims that are disputed by countries including Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines, and where recent stand-offs have inflamed tensions.\n\n\u201cSouth China Sea tensions are particularly unwelcome in Singapore because it has no territorial claims of its own there, but would inevitably get drawn into potential conflict,\u201d said Jonah Blank, senior research fellow at the NUS and senior political scientist at Rand. \u201cFrom Singapore\u2019s perspective, there is no US-China conflict that would be anything but a disaster.\u201d\n\nSingapore has been deepening military ties with the US, as Washington strengthens its security net in the Indo-Pacific region. Under a memorandum of understanding renewed in 2019, US planes and ships can pass through Singapore.\n\nBut Singaporean politicians have been careful to avoid outright criticism of China\u2019s increasingly assertive regional posture. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in July, Singapore\u2019s defence minister Ng Eng Hen said Beijing moving deeper into the South China Sea made \u201cperfect military strategic sense\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009from their point of view\u201d.\n\nMuch of Singapore\u2019s military hardware and technology has been sourced from the US or Nato, an alignment that would make the city-state \u201cdependent on the US or other western allies\u201d in a US-China conflict, Chong said. In such an event, Singapore would be asked to provide transit for the US military \u2014 which China would pressure it not to allow, he added.\n\nSingapore\u2019s defence strategy was still tilted towards conventional land capabilities, analysts said \u2014 an outdated focus when the city-state is only linked by land to Malaysia, an ally. \u201cIf there is going to be greater instability because of issues in the South China Sea and any potential conflict around Taiwan\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Singapore is going to need to make sure its sea lanes and air routes are safe,\u201d said Chong.\n\nSingapore has ordered 20 Lockheed Martin F-35s the most advanced fighter aircraft, which are set to begin arriving in 2026, as well as four Type 218SG Invincible-class submarines from Germany\u2019s Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, which are expected to be operational by 2028.\n\nAt the same time, the US and Singapore are expanding their co-operation in emerging technologies.\n\nIn July, Ng and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin agreed to co-operate on data, analytics and artificial intelligence. Singapore is seeking to incorporate AI into military thinking: it launched a fourth branch of its armed forces, the Digital and Intelligence Service, in 2022, and has held defence exercises around critical infrastructure and digital attacks.\n\n\u201cAI could also shape decision-making processes in military operations,\u201d said Collin Koh Swee Lean, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, pointing to its potential to identify threats within the \u201cconstrained and cluttered maritime domain\u201d near Singapore, which includes crucial lanes for global shipping.\n\nUltimately \u201cthere is recognition that a lot of the potential for conflict in future will involve key infrastructure that may not be physical\u201d, said Chong.\n\nThis \u2014 rather than the tanks on display in the National Day parade \u2014 may represent Singapore\u2019s future military priorities. \u201cThe calibration needs to be less land force heavy, more naval and air force,\u201d Chong said.", "tag": "singapore?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a8ff87ff-a99f-4b7b-9ef8-682b287b4b8b"}, {"uuid4": "41333cba-8510-4c9e-9a41-6320afee8132", "title": "From palm oil to data: Malaysia builds AI hub on Singapore\u2019s doorstep", "description": "Companies take advantage of cheaper land and more abundant energy", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2024-07-19T01:00:46.936Z", "content": "In what were once wild jungle and palm oil plantations in southern Malaysia, the likes of TikTok, Nvidia and Microsoft are racing to install the building blocks of the digital economy: data centres.\n\nBillions of dollars are being invested in the state of Johor, just a few kilometres from Singapore, by companies taking advantage of cheaper land and more abundant energy for computer infrastructure while staying close to south-east Asia\u2019s biggest financial centre.\n\nJohor\u2019s fortunes may soon be more closely tied to those of its wealthy neighbour. Malaysia\u2019s king, the motorbike-riding billionaire Sultan of Johor, is championing an effort to bind his state closer to Singapore in a single economic zone, expected to include tax breaks and smoother cross-border trade.\n\nThere is a model in China, where Shenzhen\u2019s transformation from fishing village to tech megapolis started after it became a special economic zone (SEZ) on the doorstep of Hong Kong.

Johor spurred investment by cutting approval times from more than three months to as little as seven days.\n\nRobin Khuda, chief executive of AirTrunk, a data centre with facilities across Asia, said Malaysia had given the company its \u201csmoothest\u201d entry to any of its markets. The group planned to expand further in Johor, Khuda said.\n\nForeign investment into the state of 4mn people hit RM58.8bn ($12.6bn) in 2022 and RM31bn in 2023, compared with RM10bn in 2019, according to figures from Malaysian Investment Development Authority.\n\nJohor\u2019s economic growth is expected to outpace national forecasts up to 2025, according to Mida.\n\nAt Johor\u2019s Sedenak Tech Park, land prices have gone from about RM40 per sq ft a couple of years ago to about RM70 to RM80, according to Adi Yaacob, a senior manager for JLand Group, the developer. The group is part of Johor Corporation, the state development company.\n\nThe activity has pushed Malaysia to the top of the list of Asia\u2019s fastest-growing data centre markets, according to a report by Cushman & Wakefield. The country has a development pipeline of 1.2 gigawatts of data storage capacity, an increase of 600 per cent in the next five years from its current 189 megawatts.\n\nMalaysia is predicted to make up the majority of south-east\u00a0Asia\u2019s data centre market in terms of capacity by 2035\u00a0thanks to its proximity to Singapore, according to Morgan Stanley research.\n\nThe next boost should come from artificial intelligence companies that want to build AI foundational or training models in Malaysia, according to Yeoh Seok Hong, managing director of YTL Power International. His company has struck a $4.3bn deal to build an AI data centre in Johor with Nvidia as a tenant \u2014 an agreement that involves a partnership in cloud computing and a supercomputer project. YTL Power\u2019s share price is up more than 100 per cent this year since the announcement.\n\nMeanwhile, ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, plans to invest about RM10bn to set up an AI hub in Malaysia, minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz said in June. The company is already an anchor tenant at three data centres in Johor. Microsoft has also been snapping up sites and recently acquired land in Johor to expand.\n\nAll of this is a prelude to the establishment of an SEZ with Singapore, which is due to be agreed this year. The push has gained momentum since the business-friendly Sultan of Johor, who has good relations with Singapore, became Malaysia\u2019s king in January.\n\n\u201cThe current king is very pro-business and wants Johor to be successful. I think Johor needs something like [the SEZ] to move forward,\u201d said Govinda Singh, an executive director at real estate consultancy Colliers International.\n\nBut he pointed to past problems between the two countries including stalled projects. A plan for a high-speed rail link between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur was abandoned after the countries failed to reach agreement.\n\n\u201cThe main difference [now] is the Johor king and [Malaysian prime minister] Anwar are really trying to get the economy up and running. There is willingness at national and state level\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Can it last? You have to be a bit sceptical,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cUltimately I am not sure Johor can be successful without [the SEZ], even with the data centre boom.\u201d\n\nMany wonder if the data centre surge will increase pressure on resources while not contributing many jobs. Malaysia still relies on fossil fuels, including coal, for most of its power. Many aspiring cloud providers have no plan for renewable energy.\n\nLiew Chin Tong, Malaysia\u2019s deputy minister for trade and industry, said he was \u201cuneasy\u201d about some parts of the industry and wanted more stringent requirements for water and renewable energy use in data centres.\n\n\u201cFinding the balance is what I am most concerned about. We also want to make sure data centres will generate spillover to the economy, such as localisation of equipment and parts as well as creation of jobs for Malaysians,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, both places have become increasingly integrated. The two land crossings between Johor and Singapore, Woodlands and Tuas Link, are among the busiest and most congested border crossings globally.\n\nOne engineer working at US semiconductor giant Micron\u2019s Singapore fabrication plant said he intended to buy property in Johor this year in anticipation of the SEZ. \u201cI can afford a house in Johor as opposed to a tiny, expensive apartment in Singapore.\u201d\n\nA SEZ would make Johor attractive to everyone from multinationals to young engineers, according to \u200b\u200bLee Ting Han, a member of Johor state\u2019s executive council. \u201cWhat I hope is that investing in Johor is one day regarded by everyone as the same as investing in Singapore.\u201d\n\nJohor was always \u201cregarded as the Wild West in Malaysia\u201d, said Greg O\u2019Shea, the head of Singapore and Malaysia for supply chain consultancy TMX Transform. \u201cThat is really starting to change.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4d8ab5e8-a7a6-4850-a631-5e9e2a4c13bb"}, {"uuid4": "cdc8cfec-4426-4a57-b9ad-f9db527d558b", "title": "Singapore port congestion threatens to gum up global trade", "description": "The longer bottlenecks last, the higher the risk of another inflationary jolt for the world", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2024-07-09T09:50:21.654Z", "content": "The risk of higher prices for everything from cars to smartphones for the world\u2019s consumers just got a lot higher. Congestion at Singapore\u2019s container port, which is at its worst since the pandemic, has started spilling over to neighbouring ports, posing a risk for global supply chains. Shipping rates have risen as much as fivefold over the past year and it is only a matter of time before some of that is passed on to shoppers.\n\nSingapore is the world\u2019s largest transshipment hub: the container port connects more than 600 ports from 123 countries and has an annual capacity of 50mn 20ft equivalent units, a measure of volume. Things are getting serious when congestion from a hub of this size starts a domino effect for neighbouring ports.\n\nThat rare phenomenon is playing out this week with container ship congestion spreading to neighbouring Malaysia.\n\nOne explanation is that ships rerouting to avoid Red Sea attacks have led to bottlenecks in other Asian and European ports. Diversions have then meant more ships going through Singapore. Maersk, the world\u2019s second-largest container carrier, for example, said it would skip two westbound sailings from China and South Korea this month owing to severe congestion. JPMorgan had estimated the Red Sea shipping crisis could add 0.7 percentage points to global core goods inflation for just the first half earlier this year.\n\nNow, another more unexpected problem could mean lasting disruptions to the global supply chain even when the Red Sea shipping crisis eases. The total volume of vessels, especially to and from China, has surged in recent months, and the annual peak shipping season has arrived earlier than expected.\n\nUS President Joe Biden unveiled tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports including chips, batteries, steel, medical products, electric cars and solar cells in May. Tariffs have also been proposed on other products such as ship-to-shore cranes. Companies have been rushing to secure inventory of these items before each of the tariffs go into effect later this year.\n\nAmong those hit will be automakers, which unlike other manufacturers of smartphones or smaller electronics, cannot shift their shipments to airfreight.\n\nSingapore\u2019s ports are not the only danger spot to watch. The biggest US ports union suspended labour talks last month and has instructed members to prepare for a possible strike starting in October, threatening to create a perfect storm for global supply chains.\n\nA backlog of a similar scale in Asia during the pandemic resulted in higher prices for all kinds of products. The longer the shipping congestion lasts in Singapore, the higher the risk of another inflationary jolt for the world.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com", "tag": "singapore?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e2392e81-5b79-4655-a68d-44c246671c86"}, {"uuid4": "8bcd1c17-99b1-4626-b750-9b9f2ecaba16", "title": "Temasek to prioritise US deals and stay cautious on China", "description": "Singapore\u2019s state-owned investor \u2018not in a hurry\u2019 to invest in artificial intelligence and warns of \u2018hype\u2019 in sector", "author": "Kaye Wiggins", "published_date": "2024-07-09T07:14:42.925Z", "content": "Singapore\u2019s state-owned fund Temasek has said it will prioritise US investments and be \u201ccautious\u201d about China after warning that its large exposure to the world\u2019s second-biggest economy had hit its performance.\n\nTemasek, one of the world\u2019s biggest state-owned investment groups, said on Tuesday that the value of its portfolio rose just 2 per cent to S$389bn ($288bn) in the year to March.\n\nWhile those figures lag behind a 28 per cent gain for the S&P 500 stock index over the same period, the rise was an improvement on last year when its value tumbled 5 per cent in its worst returns since 2016.\n\nGrowth from investments in the US and India was \u201coffset by the underperformance of China\u2019s capital markets\u201d, Temasek said in its annual review.

It was forced to write off its stake after the company collapsed, prompting a rare backlash from investors.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s a lot of capital coming into any area one needs to be watchful,\u201d Chia said at a press conference, identifying \u201cthe AI hype\u201d and the boom in private credit as two areas of exuberance.\n\nTemasek said the US would continue to be \u201cthe largest destination of our capital\u201d outside Singapore.

Nestled on a corner in one of Singapore\u2019s richest neighbourhoods, the house in question is actually a grandiose mansion with at least six red Ferraris and Lamborghinis parked outside.\n\nOwned by a wealthy local businessman, the house is well known in Singapore. It is so opulent that it features in a Crazy Rich Asians-inspired tour of the tiny, island city-state, based on the popular 2018 film.\n\nThe Hollywood hit was an invaluable marketing vehicle for Singapore and a gamble by its tourism board and film commission. Both threw their weight \u2014 and an undisclosed sum \u2014 behind the movie. The gamble paid off. After the film\u2019s release, Singapore experienced a record number of tourists and enjoyed a wave of global attention.\n\nNow, however, Singapore is trying to play down the movie and the image that it presents. A reputation for high living and expensive business costs have become a sensitive topic for locals ahead of the next general election.\n\nThe city, one of Asia\u2019s main financial centres, has been ranked the world\u2019s most expensive for nine of the past 11 years by the annual Worldwide Cost of Living survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nSingapore wants to convince locals and expats otherwise. \u201cWhat does it really cost to live in Singapore \u2014 the world\u2019s \u2018most expensive\u2019 city?\u201d ran a recent article from one of the government agencies. This dismissed \u201cfamiliar tropes\u201d, including \u201cover-the-top mansions in Crazy Rich Asians, the infinity pool at Marina Bay Sands and incredibly expensive cars\u201d.\n\nThe government\u2019s arguments are not all that convincing. Cost-saving advice includes not having to buy seasonal clothing because \u201cit\u2019s summer all year round\u201d. There are also promises of 45c cups of coffee (I am yet to find this deal) and the ability to rent government housing, held up as proof that the city is not \u201cnecessarily as expensive\u201d as London or New York.\n\nFor some, the city\u2019s extravagant reputation is still a bonus. Philip Choo, who was inspired by the book to launch the city\u2019s first Crazy Rich Asians tour in 2014, says he is still enjoying high demand from customers, especially from the US.\n\nBut a spate of recent news stories has reinforced the clich\u00e9 of foreigners living lavish lifestyles and pushing up costs for everyone else. In May, 35-year-old Chinese citizen Wang YunHe was arrested in Singapore for allegedly running one of the world\u2019s largest cyber crime computer networks. According to the indictment, his possessions included a luxury apartment in the city\u2019s glitzy Orchard shopping district, a Ferrari F8 Spider and a number of Patek Philippe watches.\n\nThe result is that more Singaporeans are questioning government schemes that have enticed the rich to live here. One example is the family office regime. There are now more than 1,400 single family offices \u2014 funds that manage a family\u2019s wealth \u2014 in the city-state, compared with 50 in 2018.\n\nManu Bhaskaran, an economist and chief executive of consultancy Centennial Asia Advisors, told me that Singapore\u2019s rising costs were the product of government policy. The \u201cbusiness model brings in foreign investors who bid up rents, wages, and other service costs\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009The family offices are an example \u2014 how much extra revenue do they generate for the rest of us?\u201d\n\nPerhaps aware of such sentiment, another government article has proclaimed that Singapore\u2019s high cost of living is limited to wealthy expatriates. It claimed city ranking calculations include \u201cproducts such as brand name raincoats and foreign daily newspapers\u201d not typically purchased by Singaporean households.\n\nSingaporeans are unimpressed. \u201cNot sure why they cherry picked two items and said it\u2019s not relevant to Singaporeans,\u201d wrote one Reddit user. Another observed that the difference might lie in the suggestion that locals should have different expectations to foreigners. \u201cIt is only expensive for expats because the average Singaporeans are not supposed to aspire for the finer things in life.\u201d\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nExtravagant claims about Singapore are clickbait\u00a0/\u00a0From Ng Teck Hean, High Commission of the Republic of Singapore, London SW1, UK", "tag": "singapore?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9eb54de2-f53a-49c4-9c15-a86f6605e6a6"}, {"uuid4": "399b8e11-4869-4fc6-a590-a040b8d01ee5", "title": "Temasek on deal hunt to boost returns for Singapore", "description": "State-owned fund urges local companies it backs to become more global and grow through acquisitions", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2024-07-01T04:00:27.001Z", "content": "Temasek has been backing a wave of international dealmaking by some of its biggest companies as the Singaporean state-owned investment company faces pressure to boost returns from its S$382bn (US$282bn) portfolio.\n\nThe global investor has been an influential \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d supporter of major mergers and acquisitions by companies it has stakes in, including Singtel, ST Engineering, Singapore Airlines and Sembcorp Marine, said two people familiar with the transactions.\n\nMore such deals encouraged by Temasek, whose profits form a major source of revenue for the government\u2019s national budget, are in the pipeline, one of the people added.\n\nWhile Temasek has become a consequential investor in public and private markets globally, Singapore-based companies still comprise 54 per cent of its portfolio.

The company said publicly this year that more engagement with portfolio companies had created a \u201cvalue uplift north of S$10bn\u201d.\n\nThe focus on dealmaking follows Temasek reporting one of its worst annual results in recent times for the year to March 2023. The company reported a 5.07 per cent drop in shareholder returns, its poorest performance since 2016. The group slowed its investment pace for the period, calling it \u201cthe most challenging year for markets\u201d in the past decade.\n\nTemasek is owned by Singapore\u2019s finance ministry. Lawrence Wong, who became Singapore\u2019s prime minister last month, has also been finance minister since 2021.\n\nTemasek\u2019s one-year total shareholder return has been negative for two of the past four years. However, the state group prefers to cite growth over the longer term, reporting in 2023 a rise of 7.7 per cent over three years and 6 per cent over 10.\n\nAnother person close to Temasek said conversations about its returns with the government were \u201cno more than the usual\u201d pressure to improve them during a period of prolonged global economic uncertainty.\n\nRecent deals involving Temasek-backed companies include telecoms provider Singtel, in which it is the majority shareholder, leading a $1.75bn investment this month in digital infrastructure business ST Telemedia Global Data Centres \u2014 another Temasek-backed company. Singtel\u2019s share price is trading at its highest since 2022.\n\nIn March, Singapore approved the merger between Tata-owned Air India and sister airline Vistara, a joint venture between Tata and Temasek-backed Singapore Airlines. The deal has been touted as strengthening the national carrier\u2019s presence in the fast-growing Indian market once it completes in 2025.\n\nLast year, Sembcorp Marine finalised a merger with Keppel Offshore & Marine, forming one of the world\u2019s largest energy operations and maintenance engineering companies. Temasek, the majority shareholder of Sembcorp Marine, was \u201cstrongly behind\u201d the deal, one of the people said.\n\nTemasek has also struck some of its own deals.

We digest some of the key numbers.\n\nHave a great weekend \u2014 we\u2019ll see you on Monday. \u2014 Simon Mundy\n\nSingapore\u2019s beaches and coastal parks have been unusually quiet in recent days. The city-state\u2019s southern coastline became a sea of black after a dredging boat hit a bunker vessel on June 14, spilling more than 400 tonnes of oil into the ocean.\n\nThe pungent kerosene smell has hit inhabitants of the mostly man-made resort island of Sentosa, which many billionaires call home. A clean-up is under way but could take months to clear fully.Singapore is an integral part of the global shipping industry given its strategic geographic location. It is one of the biggest and most important hubs in the world for bunkering \u2014 that is, supplying ships with fuel.But the latest oil spill highlights the risks of being a bustling port. The Singapore Strait is one of the busiest sea lanes in the world and remains vulnerable to oil spill accidents such as the June 14 incident. As Singapore strives to maintain its position in the industry by becoming a leader in green bunkering, the transition could expose the city to further risks.\n\nGreen bunkering involves supplying ships with alternatives to fossil fuels, such methanol and ammonia. These substances come with far lower carbon emissions than the petroleum-derived fuel oil used by most marine vessels, but are highly toxic if spilled into the sea. A 2022 study led by the Environmental Defense Fund found that an ammonia spill could have more severe impacts on fish than an oil spill of comparable size, though it would not persist for as long in the environment.The world\u2019s first voyage using ammonia as a shipping fuel, conducted by Australian miner Fortescue Metals Group, departed from Singapore in May. The city carried out the first ship-to-containership methanol bunkering for Maersk last year. The government said last month it is ready to offer full-scale commercial operations for the bunkering of methanol as a marine fuel.The commercial benefits to Singapore of being a green bunkering hub are obvious. Bunker sales of biofuel blends increased to 520,000 tonnes in 2023, more than triple the 140,000 tonnes in 2022. Total business spending by key maritime companies overseen by Singapore\u2019s Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore hit more than S$4.8bn (US$3.5bn) in 2023, up from S$4.3bn one year earlier.\n\nThe International Maritime Organization, the UN\u2019s maritime body, is set to introduce stricter emissions rules for the shipping industry \u2014 which accounts for 3 per cent of global carbon emissions annually \u2014 from 2027. Companies globally are testing the uses of methanol, ammonia and hydrogen to comply with some of these new rules.\n\nSingapore is putting money behind the green push, too. The Maritime Singapore Decarbonisation Blueprint, launched in 2022, was established to support the development and commercialisation of new technologies, with $300mn committed to initiatives over the next decade.The MPA is working with the industry and investment community to fund start-ups in this space, with some S$68mn raised for 116 start-ups as of the end of 2023. The MPA and the Singapore Maritime Institute gave S$19.3mn in funding to universities and research institutes in 2023 for maritime R&D in smart ship development and green tech.However, trialling these new fuels \u2014 which also include green hydrogen \u2014 opens Singapore up to potentially more accidents, as well as lucrative business. It does not take many incidents such as June 14 to move public opinion on the matter. Studies on the effects of an ammonia or methane leak still are ongoing, but there are already concerns in the industry over their potential dangers to both humans and marine ecosystems. Singapore may hope the risk is worth the reward.\u00a0(Mercedes Ruehl)\n\nThis year\u2019s shareholder meeting season is nearing its close, and some interesting trends are already visible in the data. Check out this chart using data from investor intelligence firm Georgeson, showing proposals voted on as of June 20 at companies in the Russell 3000 \u2014 an index designed to include the biggest 3,000 listed companies in the US.\n\nThe number of shareholder proposals related to social issues has continued to climb, with notable upticks in resolutions around artificial intelligence and health issues. In contrast, governance- and environment-related proposals have declined slightly, despite an increase in resolutions around biodiversity.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s been a steep rise in proposals against the environmental, social and governance agenda, doubling so far this year from the same period of 2022.\n\nBut if we look at rates of support for these resolutions, we see a different story:\n\nThere\u2019s much more support for governance-related proposals than for other categories, with environmental and social proposals suffering a steady decline in backing.

One of the must-know Singlish words for those living in the city-state is kiasu. The Chinese Hokkien term roughly means a fear of missing or losing out and often refers to someone trying to get ahead of others. \u201cFomo on steroids\u201d is how one Singaporean friend describes it.\n\nOne of the best places to see this in action is the queues at lunchtime around stalls of the city-state\u2019s favourite hawker food markets. Another area to observe the kiasu mentality in the Asian financial centre is in business, such as foreign investment.\n\nSingapore made a surprise announcement last month that it would free up more power for data centre expansion. The move came as the chief executives of Nvidia, Google, Microsoft and others have been swinging by neighbouring Malaysia \u2014 and other countries in south-east Asia \u2014 in recent months pledging billions in data centre investment.\n\nIn Malaysia alone, the tech groups \u2014 three of the top four biggest companies by market capitalisation globally \u2014 have committed $8.5bn in new data centre, cloud and artificial intelligence investment in the past six months. Which is why more than one Malaysian government official joked that Singapore\u2019s decision to court more data centres was a \u201ctypical Singapore kiasu response\u201d to its neighbour\u2019s progress.\n\nOf course there is some competition between Singapore and its neighbours, especially Malaysia from which it gained independence in 1965. But it is overly simplistic to dismiss Singapore\u2019s move as kiasu-ness \u2014 even if there is an element of that at play. The city-state is already hyper connected and one of the biggest data centre markets in Asia \u2014 a trend that accelerated as Hong Kong became a less favoured destination for data centres and undersea cables. It is one of the top submarine cable hubs globally, with connections to 25 active subsea cables and more to come. None of that will change soon.\n\nThe decision to increase data centre capacity last month was a surprise to many because the government imposed a more than three-year moratorium on new data centres between 2019 and 2022. The proliferation of the energy-guzzling facilities had been consuming a substantial amount of Singapore\u2019s resources. That ban helped push data centre companies into nearby Johor, the Malaysian state just across the causeway, and to a certain extent Batam, a close-by Indonesian island.\n\nThe conundrum Singapore faces now \u2014 like many other countries \u2014 is that it grossly underestimated how demand for AI is going to expand the global market for data centres in coming years. The city-state has made little secret of the fact that it wants to be the AI hub for south-east Asia, if not the top in Asia.\n\nThat\u2019s because being such a hub brings other economic benefits. For example, as part of Nvidia\u2019s data centre investment in Malaysia, the company will partner with local conglomerate YTL Power to develop the country\u2019s fastest supercomputers using Nvidia\u2019s AI chips. Microsoft last month unveiled landmark AI infrastructure investments in Indonesia and Thailand.\n\nSingapore realises it cannot ultimately compete with its neighbours for land and power. The key is how to complement it. The reason Johor is popular with global tech giants from ByteDance to Nvidia and Microsoft is because it is just a few kilometres away from hyperconnected Singapore.\n\n\u201cBoth Johor and Singapore can benefit from the data centre boom. They complement each other,\u201d says Rangnath Salgame, chair and chief executive of Princeton Digital Group, an Asian data centre company based in Singapore but expanding in Johor. It is a \u201csymbiotic relationship\u201d, he adds.\n\nAnd as more and more companies diversify supply chains away from China that puts Singapore in pole position. One way it can benefit is by promoting a Singapore + one strategy, whereby companies establish a headquarters in the country to leverage its international business environment, free trade agreements and access to professional talent, but then have their manufacturing \u2014 or data centre \u2014 facilities in places such as Johor.\n\nThis is already a long-term trend. Singapore was the top recipient of inward foreign direct investment flows in south-east Asia between 2013 and 2022, according to the latest data published by the bloc. In 2022, Singapore attracted $141bn of FDI, accounting for more than half of the region\u2019s total.

Industry experts said they appeared to be modules critical to the development of Russia\u2019s Arctic LNG 2 project.\n\nThe UK added Red Box to its sanctions list this week. The US said last month that designating Red Box demonstrated \u201cthe United States\u2019 continued resolve to constrain the Arctic LNG 2 project\u2019s production and export capacity and limit third-party support to the project\u201d.\n\nAdkins, who was born and raised in the US, has not himself been placed under sanctions.

Red Box also has offices in Rotterdam.\n\nThe Audax and Pugnax vessels are capable of carrying structures weighing 20,000 tonnes and are reinforced to allow them to traverse ice-covered waters. They played a crucial role in the construction of Russia\u2019s Yamal LNG project, which launched in 2017.\n\nBoth vessels were also designated by Ofac in May.\n\nAdkins said that a lot of banks and other third parties had \u201coverreacted\u201d to the sanctions regimes and that was making business more \u201cchallenging\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of embarrassment and disappointment\u00a0that comes with no longer being the CEO,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cBut I accept the consequences of the sanctions, even though I don\u2019t agree with them.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/692db466-28f0-43cf-bbdd-5c0eff05dac1"}, {"uuid4": "94e61e09-cd53-4d7e-8829-37e20c36b9c4", "title": "Singapore Airlines offers $25,000 to seriously injured passengers on turbulent flight", "description": "Airline\u2019s payout deal comes after Austrian Airlines\u2019 plane suffers severe damage from a hailstorm", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2024-06-11T09:11:27.839Z", "content": "Singapore Airlines is offering initial compensation of $25,000 to some of the passengers on a flight from London last month that suffered severe turbulence, leading to one death and multiple severe injuries.\n\nThose with injuries requiring long-term medical care have been offered an advance payment of $25,000.

Private equity giant Ray Dalio\u2019s family office has bought in. The wife of Alibaba founder Jack Ma has acquired several. The infamous Fujian Gang of money launderers from China and their alleged associates bought a whole portfolio.\n\nComparable to brownstones in New York\u2019s Brooklyn or properties in London\u2019s Soho, the Singaporean colonial buildings have been fetching record prices as they get snapped up by family offices, billionaires and local developers.\n\nLocated on prime land, exempt from the hefty taxes foreign buyers must pay to buy residential property and with a finite supply of roughly 6,700, commercial shophouse sales surged to an all-time high of S$1.9bn ($1.41bn) in 2021, according to data from Knight Frank, with the trend continuing in 2022.\n\nAnd while sales by volume dropped in 2023, they remained above pre-pandemic levels. So do prices. Shophouses in the city centre have been selling for S$5,000-S$6,000 per sq ft \u2014 in some cases as much as S$8,000, say estate agents. That is comparable to recent deals by Prada or Gucci\u2019s parent company Kering on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue \u2014 among the world\u2019s most expensive retail spaces.\n\nThe new owners want top tenants. Coach, Dior, boutique hotels and Michelin star restaurants are opening inside shophouses.\u00a0\u201cShophouses were one of the only asset classes whose value continued to rise even during the pandemic,\u201d says Yap Hui Yee, a director at estate agency Savills, pointing to the prestige of owning a part of Singapore history.\n\nThen, last August, Singapore police unveiled a S$3bn money-laundering investigation \u2014 the city-state\u2019s largest ever \u2014 involving individuals suspected of links to illicit online gambling from mainland China. Along with gold bars, luxury cars and handbags, the so-called Fujian Gang and their associates had also bought shophouses with the allegedly laundered funds.\n\nSome gloriously ornamented shophouses are still gathering dust as they wait to be sold to recover bank loans as part of the investigation.\n\n\u201cI see shophouses now as having a pre-AML (anti money laundering) period versus a post-AML period. It has affected transaction volumes\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009although prices are holding firm,\u201d Yap says.\n\nThe money-laundering case, along with rapid gentrification, has reinforced to many people the need to nurture a rich seam of Singaporean heritage.\n\nThe Singapore shophouse was not always in such high demand. It has come a long way from its roots in ancient China. The buildings started life as the homes of merchants and their families in the 1840s. The archetypal shophouse had the shop premises on the ground floor while the family often occupied the rear of the building and the rooms on the floors above. They were built with front verandas contiguous with their neighbours. In a city prone to sudden tropical thunderstorms and harsh sun, this created a continuous covered walkway along which to stroll. They were still being built until as late as the 1960s.\n\nWhen Singapore gained independence from Malaysia in 1965, shophouses were on the way out. Entire streets of them were demolished to make way for glittering new office blocks and shopping centres. It was only in the 1980s that the government had a shift in attitude towards old buildings, culminating in the Urban Redevelopment Authority\u2019s Conservation Master Plan of 1989. This involved gazetting city centre neighbourhoods \u2014 including Chinatown \u2014 as historic and conservation areas.\n\n\u201cMany people, including within the government, felt a lack of connection to the past and the country becoming sterile. So the government stepped in,\u201d says Clemence Lee, an executive director at property company CBRE.\n\nEven so, it is only in the past decade or so that shophouses have become hot property. Local developers such as 8M Real Estate, Clifton Partners and others started buying commercial shophouses to reinvent them into boutique hotels and jazzy bars and restaurants. Their upper storeys became especially popular as a more unique office space option than the usual skyscrapers.\n\n\u201cWhen I started buying shophouses in 2014 they were undervalued,\u201d says Ashish Manchharam, the founder of 8M Real Estate, adding that they were \u201cunder-appreciated and seen as cheap space\u201d.\n\n\u201cPlaces like Soho in London were using heritage space in creative and imaginative ways, I wasn\u2019t seeing that in Singapore,\u201d says Manchharam, who has since sold his stake in 8M.\n\nAmong 8M\u2019s projects is boutique hotel 21 Carpenter, a block of four adjoining shophouses that was once a remittance house for early immigrants. The hotel merges past and present: for example, the rooms incorporate quotes from letters immigrants wrote home to family members.\n\nInvestor demand for shophouses as a defensive asset class soared during the pandemic \u2014 \u201ceven for me now the prices are pretty expensive\u201d, Manchharam says. At the same time, draconian new laws imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong lessened the latter\u2019s appeal as an international business hub, making its longtime rival Singapore a natural alternative.\n\nAlready a stable, low-tax and business-friendly destination, Singapore experienced record inflows of capital from family offices and wealthy individuals \u2014 especially from China \u2014 eager to park money in a safe place. New investment schemes, such as single family office regimes, helped shift the global centre of gravity for the world\u2019s wealthiest towards the city-state. The number of such offices, which manage and invest a single family\u2019s private wealth, exploded from just a handful in 2018 to more than 1,500 by the end of 2022.\n\nMuch of this new capital found its way into property. Foreigners\u2019 ability to buy residential landed property in Singapore is limited to certain areas with certain permissions, so the appeal of commercial shophouses grew, especially freehold ones.\u00a0A boost to dealmaking came from government action. In April 2023 it doubled the additional buyers\u2019 stamp duty (ABSD) for foreigners from 30 per cent to 60 per cent as part of measures to cool the housing market. Most shophouses are zoned commercial so foreigners do not have to pay the higher fees associated with residential purchases.\n\n\u201cA decade ago you could buy a shophouse for S$5mn-S$8mn in the city centre but now you are looking at S$15mn-S$20mn per shophouse,\u201d says Mary Sai, an executive director at Knight Frank specialising in shophouses, citing their exemption from both ABSD and sellers\u2019 stamp duty.\n\nThat changed in August last year when Singaporean authorities arrested and charged 10 individuals, all holding Chinese passports, with money laundering. In December, 10 shophouses owned by two Chinese nationals with alleged ties to one of the accused were put on the market by DBS bank to recover repayments of its loans.\n\n\u201cThere has been a slowdown from August onwards due to the money-laundering situation and more stringent checks,\u201d Sai says. Sales of commercial shophouses fell to S$95mn in the final three months of 2023, a 70 per cent drop on the same period the year before and the lowest quarter in 13 years, according to agency PropNex.\u00a0High interest rates, which increase the cost of mortgages, have also contributed to the slowdown.\n\nHowever, many longtime tenants in heritage and tourist areas have still had to pay much higher rents or move because of new landlords who want to see a return on the millions of dollars they paid.\n\nSingaporean Aileen Tan has seven or eight businesses located around culturally rich Kampong Glam in heritage shophouses, including the popular Blu Jaz caf\u00e9. The area borders Little India and is known for its textiles shops and local cuisine eateries as much as its bars and caf\u00e9s.\u00a0She has been trying to engage government authorities to help shield tenants and protect communities.\n\n\u201cMoney from wealthy foreigners is going into shophouses and there has been a lot of flipping for profits and it is affecting tenants,\u201d she says. Tan is on her third landlord for a property that she rented two years ago. She is worried about the increase the latest owner will want for her upcoming renewal.\n\nTan has been doing business in the area for 20 years, working with other tenants in encouraging live music or getting local artist friends to paint murals on the sides of shophouses along the famous Haji Lane. But the mix has changed, and new tenants such as photo booths and souvenir chains do not care about the heritage aspect of shophouses, she argues.\n\nThe slowdown in the market for shophouses presents an opportunity, say local industry players, to think about the role shophouses should play within communities. More institutional owners and landlords are expanding efforts to showcase the buildings\u2019 heritage value. In 2020, for example, the wealthy Spanish Portabella family acquired a residential shophouse on Neil Road with the intention of donating it to support research and training in conserving shophouses.\n\nFang Low, founder and chief executive of Figment, works with owners of commercial and residential shophouses, encouraging them to \u201cbring back the soul\u201d to shophouses by working with artists and other creatives, often converting them back to residences. One of his projects has been repurposing shophouses that became karaoke bars and massage parlours\u00a0in one of Singapore\u2019s former red light districts. \u201cShophouses were homes to begin with and people forget you can live in these.\u201d\n\nLow grew up in a shophouse and returned from overseas alarmed at the \u201ccopied and pasted\u201d urban landscape of condominiums and government housing blocks. \u201cWe work with mainly foreign families but I am seeing more local Singaporeans now as appreciation grows for shophouses\u2019 heritage,\u201d Low says.\n\nOne such Singaporean is Andy Lim, of JL Family Office, who says he got into the shophouse market \u201cby chance\u201d during the pandemic. He bought one shophouse, now home to his family office on Club Street, in 2020, and a another across the road in 2021 \u2014 even as prices continued to rise.\n\n\u201cI realised there was a lot more history in this space than in the real estate I had been doing. In school I never learnt anything about this heritage,\u201d Lim says.\n\nSuch owners are willing to pay the higher prices that shophouses now command. Lim\u2019s second shophouse cost S$26mn, compared with S$21.8mn when it last sold in 2018.\u00a0But rather than renting the second property out to the highest-paying tenant, Lim has kept the space free for the public to use as a \u201csocial impact hub\u201d. Community groups are among those that use the building for minimal cost, with Lim giving up roughly S$500,000 in annual market rent.\n\nVivienne Soon, director of Breezeway Development, which owns multiple conservation shophouses, says on balance having brands \u2014 it hosted a pop-up by Coach in one of its shophouses \u2014 brings in more of the public to shophouses. But the company also charges an under-market rental for some heritage or cultural tenants.\n\n\u201cIt feels churlish to say this because we, like many others, have enjoyed a meteoric rise in capital values, but I worry about gentrification at breakneck pace,\u201d says Soon.\u00a0\u201cPure gentrification is not a great story for heritage.\u201d\n\nAnother local group that has been buying is Meir Collective, a Singaporean real estate investment and management company. Sebestian Soh, who returned from a stint in London with a newfound appreciation for the beauty of Singapore shophouses, convinced his father, a property developer, to invest family money in the market in 2018.\n\nAs well as buying, selling and conserving heritage real estate \u2014 Meir now has a portfolio of 21 shophouses \u2014 Soh and his team help owners manage their properties including giving conservation advice. Soh\u2019s first shophouse purchase is now home to his family office.\n\nSoh says that while the market has taken a pause after the money-laundering investigation, and as some properties are sold to pay back loans, he expects demand will recover. But he hopes companies like Meir can help the flood of new shophouse owners appreciate their value to Singapore.\n\n\u201cIt can be tough to navigate the government\u2019s planning controls. But it is important to work together as shophouses become increasingly institutionalised,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore there was Singapore there were shophouses. Everything else is new.

They have invested in Singapore real estate, with shophouses a popular choice. The properties sometimes stand empty or are used as offices, residential buildings or business premises.\n\nA development approval issued by the government at the end of 2023 for the site at 44 and 46 Club Street lists Tan Mae Shen, the Singapore managing director of the Dalio Family Office, as the developer.\n\nRenovation of the properties is due to finish early next year, according to the application, and the company has started hiring on LinkedIn. The Dalio Family Office is also expanding in Abu Dhabi after the billionaire stepped away from his hedge fund.\n\nA spokesperson for Dalio declined to comment. Rawlinson & Hunter, a London-based professional services firm named on the ownership documents, also declined to comment.\n\nSingapore is home to nearly 60 per cent of family offices in the Asia-Pacific region, according to KPMG. The family office of Google co-founder Sergey Brin has also set up a branch in Singapore, alongside many rich Chinese families.\n\nThere are about 6,700 shophouses with conservation status in Singapore. The buildings, whose design was introduced by Chinese immigrants in the 1800s, doubled as the business premises and living accommodations of early merchants in the former colonial outpost.\n\nZhang Ying, the wife of Alibaba founder Jack Ma, in January paid about S$45mn for three adjoining shophouses on nearby Duxton Road, according to documents lodged with the government. Zhang is also a Singaporean citizen.\n\nSales of shophouses hit a record S$1.9bn in 2021 with the average price of a property rising from a range of S$5mn-S$8mn to S$15mn-S$20mn over the past decade, according to real estate consultancy Knight Frank.\n\nThe consultancy said the doubling of the property stamp duty for foreigners to 60 per cent last year on residential purchases fuelled interest in commercial shophouses among family offices, since the properties can serve as part of their assets and as an office.\n\nHowever, both shophouse sales and the rate of openings of new family offices have slowed since last August\u2019s S$3bn money laundering investigation in Singapore. Some of the accused and their alleged associates were linked to family offices and acquired shophouses with the funds.\n\nIn response to the investigation, the Monetary Authority of Singapore tightened checks for family offices at the end of last year, slowing sales of the heritage properties.\n\nIn December, 10 shophouses owned by two Chinese nationals with alleged ties to an accused person in the money laundering case were put on the market by DBS bank to recover repayments of its loans.\n\n\u201cSome, although not all, of those properties associated with the launderers are being sold and the market \u2014 especially foreign buyers \u2014 are waiting to see what price they fetch and to draw a line under the saga,\u201d said one property agent who declined to be named.\n\n\u201cBut it has tarnished the shophouse market by association, so I expect sales to be lower this year.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Ortenca Aliaj in London", "tag": "singapore?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9741784e-f69a-45cf-adf3-cc5b863c873f"}, {"uuid4": "77218682-f408-421a-81e5-ecf31f0d08ea", "title": "Singapore pledges \u2018thorough investigation\u2019 into turbulence-hit flight", "description": "Members of Transport Safety Investigation Bureau sent to Bangkok to probe incident", "author": "Philip Georgiadis", "published_date": "2024-05-22T10:23:00.860Z", "content": "Singapore\u2019s prime minister has promised a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d\u00a0after a British man died and dozens were injured during extreme turbulence on a Singapore Airlines flight from London.\n\nMembers of Singapore\u2019s Transport Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB) were dispatched to Bangkok to formally investigate the sudden turbulence that hit Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 on Tuesday.\n\nA 73-year-old British man died during the incident, identified as Geoff Kitchen.

A person with knowledge of the deal said the package included tax exemptions and other government subsidies.\n\nConstruction of the site will begin this year, and the company expects it to be operational in 2029.\n\nSingapore, a small island city-state, has limited space, and in recent years has focused on luring foreign high-tech manufacturing with\u00a0generous subsidies and tax incentives.\n\nThe country has more mature manufacturing facilities compared with neighbouring countries in south-east Asia such as Malaysia and Indonesia, and has benefited immensely from supply chain shifts as companies diversify away from China.\n\nCompanies including Siemens have unveiled big investments in Singapore in recent years, with the German group announcing a high-tech plant in the city-state last year.

What a close brush with disaster, readers will think. What a potential loss to English letters and the Clerkenwell restaurant trade. Relax. This happened in one of the safest countries on Earth. I got my infant meanderings out of the way in Singapore.\n\nA point gets lost in all the coverage of the island state as it changes leadership this month. Economic enrichment is Singapore\u2019s other achievement. It comes below, and wouldn\u2019t have happened without, the creation of order and cohesion where there had been communal strife. To quote its per capita income, which now tops that of the US, is to understate what has happened in a once-fractious Chinese-Malay-Indian society.\n\nSo, what can other countries learn from Singapore? Be small. If the US could hive off 320mn people and 99 per cent of its land mass, it would be an easier nation to mould. Second, have a maritime rather than continental setting. The likes of Bolivia are missing a trick there. Third, and foremost, get an individual of the calibre of Lee Kuan Yew as founder-leader. I presume there are headhunters for these things.\n\nAnd so on and so unhelpfully on. In the end, Singapore is too particular, too sui generis in both its assets and liabilities, to constitute a template. It has but one universal lesson: the importance of an open mind.\n\nThe podcaster Chris Williamson has an almost-great line. \u201cIf I know one of your views, and from it, I can accurately predict everything else that you believe, then you\u2019re not a serious thinker.\u201d As a quote, it needs some Wildean polishing. But it captures the single oddest thing about politics. From someone\u2019s view on, say, Israel-Palestine, it is too easy to anticipate their opinion on public spending, on abortion, on Brexit, on net zero. A lot of people, even or above all the most educated, take their views from their peers as a kind of bundled software. This is what we might call irrational coherence.\n\nSingapore is a lesson in what can be done when this mental trap is avoided. If the mark of a thinking person is a having a weird mix of beliefs, the island has had a few among its policymakers. This is a high-income nation where most people live in public housing. It is a private-sector paradise where civil servants can earn a fortune.\u00a0 It has an acute sense of independence from the west but uses English as the main language of instruction. Conservatives in Britain and America have tended to regard the island as proof of concept: look what stern laws and low taxes can do. (It was under President Reagan that LKY addressed the US Congress.) But the government involves itself in matters of identity to an extent that would make the same people flinch.\n\nThe Singaporean \u201cmethod\u201d has been to come at each question afresh. The result is a lack of pattern: a libertarian nanny state. Even the nation\u2019s Freedom House score, 48 out of 100, shows how hard it is to categorise the place. (The UAE, to which Singapore is so often likened, scores 18. Switzerland, another expat hub, rates 96.)\n\nIt is difficult to examine each issue one faces on its merits. This isn\u2019t, or isn\u2019t just, laziness, but a need for the comfort blanket of a worldview and a like-minded tribe. In the west, I sense, politics has come to provide the fellow-feeling that might once have come from religion, large families or a homogeneous town. If Singapore, or at least its officials, have been able to resist this, perhaps it is because the very idea of groupism has such raw historical connotations there.\n\nThe press is full of \u201cWhither Singapore?\u201d articles this month, and fair enough. The country has to navigate the US-China rift without the helpful scale of other Asean nations. It flourished in a world order that is decomposing. (LKY\u2019s all-too-prescient speech to Congress urged America to uphold free trade.) But the island\u2019s ultimate advantage, and example to the world, was always inside the head.\u00a0That rational incoherence isn\u2019t so easily lost.\n\nEmail Janan at janan.ganesh@ft.com\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life & Art wherever you listen", "tag": "singapore?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6f59d545-8201-4fe6-b280-3e96cc245dc4"}, {"uuid4": "7866acc1-9eb4-47fd-b238-131be8fd2681", "title": "Lawrence Wong sworn in as Singapore\u2019s prime minister", "description": "US-trained economist succeeds Lee Hsien Loong to become country\u2019s fourth leader", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2024-05-15T13:16:18.742Z", "content": "Lawrence Wong has been sworn in as Singapore\u2019s new leader, as the city-state charts a new path after decades of rule by the founding Lee family.\n\nWong, 51, is only the fourth prime minister of the Asian financial hub. He succeeds Lee Hsien Loong, who had led the tightly governed island nation since 2004 but announced he was stepping down last month.\n\nA US-trained economist who has been deputy prime minister since 2022 and who also serves as finance minister, Wong was sworn in on Wednesday evening at the presidential palace, completing the rare political transition.\n\nSpeaking after his swearing-in, Wong warned that Singapore was grappling with a \u201cdangerous and troubled world\u201d. The city-state had enjoyed 30 years of peace in the Asia-Pacific since the end of the cold war, but that \u201cera is over\u201d, he said.\n\nAs a small country with an open economy, Singapore would be affected by international conflict and rivalry, \u201cmarked by geopolitical tensions, protectionism and rampant nationalism\u201d, Wong said in an often grim speech.\n\nWong\u2019s succession was carefully choreographed by the ruling People\u2019s Action party, which has governed Singapore continuously since 1959. Lee, who oversaw 20 years of stunning economic success for the country, will stay on in government as a senior minister.\n\nWong called the moment a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d for the young country. \u201cI am the first prime minister of Singapore to be born after independence [in 1965],\u201d he said, adding he and other so-called fourth generation politicians would differ from their predecessors.\n\n\u201cWe will lead in our own way. We will continue to think boldly and think far. We know that there is still much more to do,\u201d he said.\n\nAcademia SG, a collective of Singaporean scholars, welcomed Wong\u2019s pledge to \u201cmaximise the combined energies, imaginations and strengths of all Singaporeans\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe new team should reject the legacy of punitive and paternalistic responses to dissenting views,\u201d the group said.\n\nOn the domestic front, Wong and his team will face increasing pressures over deepening inequality, higher living costs and unhappiness among the country\u2019s local population with foreign workers, including expatriates.\n\nRecord capital inflows from greater China as well as countries such as India and the US have raised living costs and house prices.\n\nA financial hub and trading centre of just 6mn people, Singapore is reliant on overseas workers, from construction labourers to top-tier bankers. But the government has increasingly restricted the employment of foreigners to prioritise the local labour force.\n\nSingapore, which maintains friendly relations with both the US and China, is also navigating a more febrile geopolitical landscape in the Asia-Pacific region as a result of the superpowers\u2019 rivalry.\n\n\u201cWe have to be guided by what is in Singapore\u2019s national interest and do so in a way that is consistent and principled,\u201d Wong said. \u201cAnd that means from time to time, we will have to say things or do things that some countries may not be so happy with. It could be China one day, it could be the US another day.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s departure raises the likelihood of a general election, which Singapore is due to hold by November 2025, coming this year. The PAP has in recent elections suffered a declining share of the popular vote, making the first contest with Wong at the helm a consequential test for the ruling party.\n\nWong, who as with every prime minister to precede him is ethnically Chinese and western-educated, became a member of parliament in 2011 after more than a decade in the civil service.\n\nDespite the carefully managed succession, Wong was not always the intended next leader. The PAP\u2019s initial succession plans for Lee were thrown into disarray in 2021 after deputy prime minister Heng Swee Keat stepped out of the running. Wong was selected in 2022.\n\nLee\u2019s departure also draws to a close his family\u2019s leadership of the country. His father, the late Lee Kuan Yew, is regarded as the patriarch of modern Singapore, ruling from 1959 until 1990.\n\nWhen Goh Chok Tong, Singapore\u2019s second prime minister, took over, Lee Hsien Loong was waiting in the wings as deputy prime minister before becoming leader himself in 2004.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nSingapore still coping with foreign policy vulnerability\u00a0/\u00a0From Khaw Wei Kang, Macau", "tag": "singapore?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ac123050-af07-4119-8f36-e7c92487cf52"}, {"uuid4": "8b1420ee-52c5-4bf7-89fd-8428190ef64d", "title": "Lawrence Wong, Singapore\u2019s next PM faces an ever trickier balancing act", "description": "When the politician is sworn in next week, he will have to contend with rising social and geopolitical tensions", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2024-05-11T02:00:24.170Z", "content": "Shortly before Taylor Swift arrived in Singapore in March, the country\u2019s deputy leader, Lawrence Wong, went viral after posting an awkward TikTok video of himself playing her \u201cLove Story\u201d on his guitar.\u00a0The unassuming US-trained economist will have to get used to the spotlight. On May 15, Singaporeans will wake up to Wong becoming their first new prime minister in 20 years.\u00a0He will be only the second non-member of the Lee family dynasty to lead the tiny, affluent island city-state of 6mn people.\n\nThis is just the third transition of power since Singapore\u2019s independence from Malaysia in 1965. Last month Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced he would step down as head of the ruling People\u2019s Action Party. His late father, Lee Kuan Yew, regarded as the architect of modern Singapore, led the nation from 1959 until 1990.\n\nThe older Lee\u2019s combination of economic planning, investor-friendly policies and openness to trade gave the nation some of the highest living standards in the world. Under the current Lee, it has flourished as a global financial centre.\u00a0But Wong, a former civil servant, will take the reins as the city-state navigates a challenging geopolitical environment. Cracks are also emerging in its heavily state-directed society.\n\n\u201cWe punch above our weight in global affairs,\u201d says Chan Heng Chee, a Singaporean academic serving as ambassador-at-large at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But she warns against complacency. \u201cThe economic model is changing,\u201d she explains, \u201cshifting away from the globalising forces that helped make Singapore a success towards greater protectionism. Different times call for different leaders.\u201d\n\nNot that Wong\u2019s appointment signals a revolution. He has been preparing for a carefully choreographed transition since April 2022. Meanwhile, fissures in society have widened with a rising cost of living and greater inequality. Resentment of foreign workers, a large part of the city\u2019s labour force, has increased while the PAP faces pressure to transform from an illiberal leadership to a more inclusive government. In addition, the US-China rivalry is playing out in neutral Singapore\u2019s backyard, necessitating an ever trickier balancing act.\n\nWong, 51, comes from humble origins and did not attend elite schools. His father was born in China but moved to Singapore and his mother was a teacher. His political rise was swift. He served as Lee\u2019s principal private secretary from 2005 to 2008, then led the education and national development ministries before becoming finance minister in 2021 and deputy prime minister in 2022. One person who knows him calls him \u201crelatable, if a little uptight\u201d.\n\nAs co-chair of the Covid-19 task force, Wong was associated with Singapore\u2019s efficient handling of the pandemic. \u201cIt paved the way for his visibility with everyday Singaporeans for the first time,\u201d says Linda Lim, a professor emerita at the University of Michigan, who knew Wong when he studied economics there.\u00a0Yet it was not the public that chose Wong. Lim claims he was selected because he was acceptable to the largest group of people within the PAP, rather than for being a visionary. \u201cHe is a piece of the puzzle, but the party is still everything in Singapore,\u201d she says.\n\nOthers are more blunt. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the first choice for many but he is close to the prime minister,\u201d says one public servant who dealt with Wong as Lee\u2019s principal private secretary. \u201cNever did I think back then that he would be the next leader of Singapore.\u201d\n\nDespite carefully curated videos of his guitar playing and enjoying local landmarks, Wong, who is twice married with no children, has remained relatively private.\u00a0\u201cHe is not a natural politician, he is a technocrat by training and inclination and he will need to learn the cut and thrust of politics,\u201d says Eugene Tan, a professor at Singapore Management University. \u201cRight now, though, he still needs to prove he can rally not just the public but also his colleagues behind him.\u201d\n\nDonald Low, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, has known Wong for decades and describes him as an \u201copen-minded conservative\u201d whose ability to adapt quickly is often underestimated. \u201cHe favours incremental over radical change, evolution over revolution,\u201d he says.\n\nWong has stressed continuity and said there will not be cabinet changes until after a general election. Prime Minister Lee will stay as a senior minister. Others, though, would like to see more original policies. \u201cIn a more tumultuous world, will just some policy tweaks by the new leadership be enough?\u201d says Ja Ian Chong, associate professor at the National University of Singapore.\n\nBut first, Wong will need a mandate. The next general election is now expected as soon as this year.\u00a0It will be a consequential poll, even though a PAP victory is all but assured. The party, which has governed since independence, earned one of its lowest vote shares in the 2020 election. The opposition Workers\u2019 party meanwhile won the highest number of seats since independent Singapore\u2019s first general election in 1968 and has repeatedly called for more inclusive governance.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in independent Singapore history where the prime minister can no longer look to more advanced economies and say we just need to catch up,\u201d Low says. Strong leadership with more participation from voices outside the PAP is needed, he adds. \u201cThe road map has to come from within.

He had become one of the city-state\u2019s wealthiest people before his empire collapsed in 2020 as oil prices tumbled.\n\nWith its low corporate tax rates and stability, coupled with a location straddling the shipping lanes that connect China with global markets, Singapore has become one of the world\u2019s biggest commodities hubs, competing directly with London, Geneva and Houston.\n\nBut the wrongdoing exposed at Hin Leong, along with other commodities trading scandals, have raised questions about the integrity of Singapore\u2019s regulatory framework and its oversight of commodities trading houses.\n\nA high-profile accounting scandal in 2018 at commodities business Noble Group\u2019s Singapore entity brought the business to the brink of collapse, while Japan\u2019s biggest trading house Mitsubishi Corporation was forced to liquidate its Singapore unit Petro-Diamond in 2019 after a rogue trader lost more than $300mn through unauthorised transactions.\n\nHSBC and DBS, Singapore\u2019s biggest lender, were among the bank creditors that provided trade financing to Hin Leong for years, with Lim originally being charged in 2020 after confessing to hiding US$800mn in losses and directing the company\u2019s finance department not to disclose the losses, suffered in futures markets.\n\nHe also revealed he had sold a \u201csubstantial part\u201d of the company\u2019s oil inventories and used the cash as general funds, even though it was the subject of inventory financing agreements with banks.\n\nHe was later hit with more than 100 other charges, but prosecutors proceeded to trial on just three of them.

The Singapore Venture & Private Capital Association (SVCA) includes state funds GIC and Temasek, local and global venture firms, and buyout groups including General Atlantic, Warburg Pincus and KKR.\n\nDiscussions have been going on since the beginning of the year, the people added, and the SVCA\u2019s proposals are also being considered by the government\u2019s Economic Development Board, Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\nThe government did not commission the document, but it has appeared as it discusses policy changes with SGX to boost the stock market. The two are responding to the next wave of south-east Asian companies \u2014 such as Singapore-based automotive marketplace Carro \u2014 opting for the US over Singapore to list.\n\nAmong the proposals suggested is mandating stock market participation from the record sums of private capital that have poured into the city-state in recent years, such as into family offices and other wealth management businesses.\n\nThere are also more politically sensitive suggestions, such as mechanisms allowing pension and sovereign money to be invested in the stock market as seen in Australia or Thailand, the people said. While Temasek invests in local companies, GIC, which manages the government\u2019s foreign reserves, only invests internationally.\n\n\u201cThere has been a shift in thinking by the government that this is not just an SGX problem but important to Singapore\u2019s national agenda. Is it possible to be a well-rounded and relevant international financial centre with an anaemic stock market? Perhaps not,\u201d said an industry executive involved with the discussions.\n\nOne person involved in the document\u2019s creation who did not wish to be named said they had \u201cnot seen an all-government and industry approach like this since Singapore first decided it wanted to foster a tech and venture capital industry in the late 2000s\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, they seem more willing to consider more maverick, aggressive moves such as investing pension money \u2014 which is normal elsewhere but new for Singapore.\u201d\n\nSGX chair Koh Boon Hwee, appointed last year, has been heavily involved and more willing to hear fresh perspectives, the people said. Koh, a business veteran in the city-state, has also chaired telecoms group Singtel, the city\u2019s biggest bank DBS and Singapore Airlines.\n\nThe MAS said it \u201chas received the proposals and is reviewing them\u201d. SGX, the EDB and MTI declined to comment.\n\nSingapore has risen as a financial centre in recent years, boosted by a crackdown by China\u2019s President Xi Jinping on the rival business hub of Hong Kong and record amounts of private wealth and capital flowing into the island state, regarded as a haven for its stability and business-friendly, low tax market.\n\nBut the government\u2019s success in private markets has never flowed through to its stock exchange \u2014 even as more new economy and technology companies set up their headquarters in Singapore.\n\nSGX has been dogged by low volumes and questions over corporate disclosure practices. Delistings frequently outnumber listings. The bourse has a high concentration of businesses in which state investor Temasek has a big block stake, as well as asset-heavy companies such as real estate investment trusts that have languished in recent years amid higher interest rates.\n\nThe exchange was one of the quietest globally last year in terms of deals and funds raised, at seven and $300mn respectively, according to PwC research. Its poor performance has become starker with regional exchanges preparing for an initial public offering revival as global macroeconomic conditions improve.\n\nThe Indonesian stock exchange was among the top five exchanges globally by total number of IPOs in 2023. India recorded its highest number of IPOs since 2017 last year at 234, an increase of 56 per cent on 2022 while private investors are shifting more capital to it in preference to China.\n\nJapanese stocks last month broke a bubble-era record while Hong Kong Exchange has appointed new leadership as the city fights to maintain its status as a major financial centre.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing fear that even some private capital could leave Singapore in favour of being closer to those faster-growing markets, especially India,\u201d said one Singapore-based venture capital managing partner consulted by the government and SGX.\n\nThe government has also been closely watching other countries\u2019 policies, such as the UK dialling up the pressure on pension schemes to help companies grow, the people said. Like GIC, Singapore\u2019s Central Provident Fund also has abundant capital. While retail investors can use their CPF money to invest in selected stocks, that does not move the needle in terms of volumes. There is no government policy that mandates or encourages CPF investment into equities at a broader level.\n\nAnother proposal includes more collaboration with south-east Asian stock markets, including the potential for Singapore to host a regional exchange down the track and underpin any issues such as currency risk.\n\n\u201cSingapore trumpets that it is an \u2018innovation economy\u2019 but has a retirement system that is so risk averse. Building that liquidity might start to incentivise fund managers,\u201d another person familiar with the talks said.\n\nOthers however questioned whether the latest attempt would be enough to turn around SGX\u2019s trajectory.\n\n\u201cCreating supply and demand is hard. They really need to be talking to market makers like local funds and asset managers and I still am not seeing that,\u201d said one Singapore-based hedge fund executive.\n\nPrevious efforts, such as tie-ups with the Nasdaq and Tel Aviv exchanges to attract secondary listings, or a Spac regime being introduced in 2021, have failed to work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have ideas and to make it part of the Singapore national agenda. But fixing poor disclosure practices, or strengthening corporate governance to give investors more assurance, remain the broader issues for us,\u201d the hedge fund executive added.", "tag": "singapore?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/656b387e-a21e-4200-9fb6-8e9474408412"}, {"uuid4": "4bced31e-b8c4-4bc9-b7a3-447e41bbd888", "title": "Singapore gives top-level briefings to reassure foreign banks on stability", "description": "City-state keen to bolster its image as a reliable financial centre at a time of rising US-China tensions", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2024-04-21T02:00:59.139Z", "content": "Singapore has given international banks an unusual series of top-level briefings on geopolitics as it seeks to reassure them that the financial hub can remain stable and neutral at a time of rising tension between China and the west.\n\nIn meetings organised by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s office, officials discussed US-China rivalry, the Middle East conflict, the Ukraine war and the $2.2bn money-laundering scandal that rocked the city-state in August, according to four people with knowledge of the talks.\n\nThe meetings have been held over the past six months with US and European financial institutions including Citigroup and Standard Chartered as well as some local banks, they said.\n\nCo-ordinating minister for national security Teo Chee Hean, a top public official, led many of the discussions. Foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan, trade and industry minister Gan Kim Yong and minister for home affairs K Shanmugam, were also involved in some of the briefings, the people said.\n\nThe city-state has plotted a careful path as a neutral financial centre at a time of rising tensions between Beijing and Washington and the briefings show Singapore\u2019s determination to reinforce its neutrality after large inflows of people and capital from mainland China.\n\nOne attendee said the US-China tensions \u201cfeatured heavily\u201d in the talks and officials sought to correct a \u201cmisperception\u201d that Singapore is tilting towards China. \u201cThey were trying to explain that Singapore is not neutral but is friendly with both and chooses according to its own interests depending on the situation,\u201d they said.\n\nAnother person who attended a briefing said that the government sought to reassure those present that financial institutions were not going to face unnecessary regulation in the wake of a $2.2bn money laundering investigation, the largest in the city-state\u2019s history.\n\nTen foreigners linked to China have been charged with money laundering and the financial regulator is probing whether lenders and other institutions took necessary steps to mitigate risks as part of the probe.\n\nBanks have since significantly tightened up scrutiny of clients, with approvals for setting up private banking accounts and new family offices in the city-state now stretching into months and in some cases more than one year.\n\nMinisters overall sought to emphasise Singapore\u2019s safety, reliability and trustworthiness amid geopolitical uncertainty.\n\n\u201cWhile Singapore regularly holds meetings with business groups, briefings by such senior ministers are not routine. The government [being] proactive, especially after the money laundering episode and the current global political and economic uncertainty,\u201d one person familiar with the briefings said. \u201cSingapore\u2019s global stock as a financial hub is rising and the risks of being misunderstood and bad actors operating here have become greater.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s office said public officials have been engaging with various groups, including banks and finance institutions, for decades. \u201cWe engage on a variety of issues \u2014 not only on international developments but also economic and social issues\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Participants appreciate the opportunity to engage with ministers and public officials,\u201d Lee\u2019s office said.\n\nA US bank executive said the meetings had been well received by local employees, though senior leadership were surprised that the prime minister\u2019s office was contacting the business on geopolitical matters. The inclusion of ministers such as Teo, a former two-star rear-admiral who has been serving as co-ordinating minister for national security since 2015, \u201craised eyebrows\u201d, they said.\n\n\u201cThe ministers attending are among the top in Singapore, it is not something you say no to but it was surprising,\u201d the person said. \u201cThe overall message we got was they want to make clearer that Singapore is still the safest, most reliable financial hub in the region.\u201d\n\nStandard Chartered and Citigroup declined to comment.\n\nThis story has been amended to correct the name of the Singapore home affairs minister K Shanmugam", "tag": "singapore?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/cdea5463-3fd8-4642-94aa-d8ccd45c90b6"}, {"uuid4": "5bb27c40-43ff-4260-8ca8-f903dc59330a", "title": "Air India chief hails \u2018climb\u2019 phase in carrier\u2019s \u2018national mission\u2019 of revival", "description": "Former state-run airline now owned by Tata is spending billions to win back customers who had lost faith in its service", "author": "John Reed", "published_date": "2025-01-13T05:00:07.321Z", "content": "The chief executive of Air India has acclaimed the carrier\u2019s progress in an ambitious turnaround under its Tata Group owner, while acknowledging the challenge of restoring the reputation of the former state-owned national carrier that Indians love to complain about.\n\nCampbell Wilson, the Singapore Airlines veteran hired after Tata bought Air India in a $2.4bn deal in 2022, is taking steps to transform the airline\u2019s offering and expand and modernise its fleet as it looks to win back some of the customers who deserted it for Gulf or other foreign airlines.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a blessing and a curse to being the national carrier,\u201d the New Zealander told the Financial Times in an interview at Air India\u2019s headquarters outside Delhi. \u201cThere is a lot of love and a lot of expectation, and there is a lot of commentary \u2014 for better or worse.\u201d\n\nIn India, he said, \u201cit\u2019s just a little more heightened because of the profile of India\u2019s decline and the hopes and dreams of India\u2019s rise\u201d.\n\nUnder the airline\u2019s five-year transformation plan dubbed Vihaan (Sanskrit for \u201cdawn of a new era\u201d), Wilson has steered Air India through the \u201ctaxi\u201d and \u201ctake-off\u201d steps of the turnaround. By its own account it is now in the final, \u201cclimb\u201d phase, merging its sprawling operations, driving profitability and enhancing customer value, and taking Indian aviation to the global stage.\n\nNew aircraft from 2023\u2019s huge 470-jet Boeing and Airbus order are beginning to arrive at an average rate of one every six days, allowing Air India to open more routes. Meanwhile, the company is overhauling tired interiors in some of its older aircraft \u2014 a process that has been delayed by supply chain bottlenecks in the global industry.\n\nWilson completed two mergers in 2024 \u2014 between Air India and Vistara, its joint venture with Singapore Airlines, and between its two regional airlines, Air India Express and Air Asia India.\n\nThis is a corporate turnaround story in sync with India\u2019s triumphalist narrative under the Narendra Modi government of a rising nation proudly shedding its past of colonial oppression and economic underperformance.\n\nFor Tata, the business opportunity is clear: if Air India successfully transforms its fleet, upgrades its service and flies more new routes between India and Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, it can win back customers who had sworn off it, including passengers among India\u2019s large diaspora.\n\nThe airline is still in the red: it reported a net loss of Rs44bn ($520mn) in the financial year to the end of March 2024, narrower than the Rs114bn it had lost the previous year.\n\nFor some, the change is not fast enough. Indian media and social media have revelled in Air India\u2019s mishaps since Tata bought it, from missing luggage and damaged seats to poor food and two emergency landings in Russia for safety reasons in 2023 and 2024.\n\n\u201cPeople are getting impatient about why it is taking so long for Air India to be rejuvenated, to be made into a world-class airline, which has been the ambition of the Tatas,\u201d said Jitender Bhargava, a former executive director of the airline and author of a book on the carrier, The Descent of Air India.\n\nWilson insisted the turnaround is on track, saying it was a feat to have managed two mergers, an overhaul of the Air India brand \u2014 including a new logo, uniforms and livery \u2014 and to have recruited more than 9,000 new employees, reducing the workforce\u2019s average age from 54 to 35.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no airline that I\u2019m aware of in history that has done all these things at the same time, and done it in two and a bit years,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Tata bought Air India, it was struggling to pay vendors and had 30 aircraft on the ground that, Wilson recalled, the airline was cannibalising for parts to keep the rest of the fleet in the air. Staff were using private Gmail accounts for company business. Air India was the last airline using its ancient, mainframe computer reservation system.\n\nTata committed $200mn to revamping its IT system and consolidated 63 offices into a single campus in Gurugram.\n\nIn February 2023 it announced what was then the biggest jet order in aviation history for 470 aircraft, later to be pipped by its biggest domestic rival IndiGo, which ordered 500 jets from Airbus in June.\n\nWilson also set about refurbishing interiors and sourcing components for Air India\u2019s existing fleet, including the 30 grounded jets that had been raided for parts.\n\n\u201cSomething like 30,000 components we had to find \u2014 and that was just one aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\nDelivery of some of the Boeing aircraft, he added, had been delayed by the recent strike by machinists at the US group, further straining a \u201ctight market\u201d for delivery of aircraft and componentry.\n\n\u201cEvery airline is affected,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just probably a little bit more frustrating for us, in an aircraft and product renewal process with an appetite for massive expansion.\u201d\n\nAir India has, however, managed to induct 100 aircraft in less than two years, allowing it to launch more than 100 new routes.\n\nOutside critics of the airline say Wilson should have taken a more radical approach to overhauling its existing fleet, which still includes old aircraft with dowdy interiors on many domestic routes. Indian media have made headline news of customer complaints about its \u201cunclean, worn-off seats\u201d or a traveller on a New York-bound flight who said she was served an omelette with a cockroach in it.\n\n\u201cThe problem with Air India was never about the branding,\u201d said Mark Martin, an aviation analyst and chief executive of Martin Consulting. \u201cThe problem with Air India was the quality of the product \u2014 the seats, the cabins, the heat exchanges, the in-flight entertainment \u2014 and the first priority should have been to get the 180 existing aircraft back online.\u201d\n\nBecause some of the jets were older and their parts no longer in production, Wilson has had to turn to Air India sister company Tata Technologies to help reverse engineer plastics, trays and recliners for business and first-class seats. (A business seat in a Boeing 787, he said, had 11 different actuators to control its position.)\n\nAir India still faces entrenched scepticism among Indians who abandoned it during its decades of decline. It also faces vigorous competition from the foreign carriers that fly to India and from IndiGo, which introduced an \u201cIndiGo Stretch\u201d business class on the Delhi-Mumbai route last month, taking the flag carrier on directly for its highest-value customers.\n\nBhargava thinks that in a growing Indian market both Air India and IndiGo \u201cwill give any Gulf airline a run for the money\u201d once they take delivery of all of their long-haul aircraft on order.\n\nWilson acknowledges the competition, but points to small victories, such as Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller having recently voted Air India the world\u2019s 12th-best airline.\n\n\u201cWe do see this as a bit of a national mission, to make a new Air India,\u201d he said. \u201cIf and when we get it right \u2014 and I\u2019m quite convinced it\u2019s when \u2014 there will be a huge level of support and engagement and customer loyalty that will come.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo I\u2019d rather there be some interest than no interest.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8ace7407-2e4f-4729-b747-7f21ffe90d85"}, {"uuid4": "49088062-e0b3-49eb-938c-be4c39cfcb13", "title": "Nadella\u2019s micro gift to India", "description": "Also in this newsletter: the bull run in defence stocks, and the car industry\u2019s software problem", "author": "Veena Venugopal", "published_date": "2025-01-10T01:30:29.082Z", "content": "Good morning. Last week, we talked about India\u2019s slowing GDP and now official estimates have placed it at 6.4 per cent, the slowest year since the pandemic. Over the next few weeks, we\u2019ll assess the impact this will have on our investment and consumption climate and what the government\u2019s Budget proposals to spur growth are likely to be. In today\u2019s newsletter, we also take a look at the bull run in defence-sector stocks in Indian equities. But first, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive is on a whirlwind tour of India, leaving a trail of gifts behind him. It\u2019s good news, but could it have been better?\n\nMicrosoft chief Satya Nadella was in India earlier this week, dropping gifts like a belated Santa Claus. Local news reports led with the $3bn investment that the company is planning to make over the next two years in India. This money is mostly for developing artificial intelligence and cloud services under Azure, Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing platform, and part of it will also go towards training 10mn Indians on AI skills by 2030. Nadella described this as the single largest expansion that Microsoft has ever done in India.\n\nNadella is excited by the level of development activity going on in India; some 17mn Indian developers are on GitHub, a platform that allows developers to create, store and share their code, which Microsoft acquired in 2018. He expects Indians to be the largest community on GitHub by 2028. Indian developers are working on more than 30,500 generative AI projects.\n\nThese numbers are interesting but not phenomenal. The global AI arms race, at this point, is clearly between the US and China. American technology companies are hoping the incoming Donald Trump administration will not place any regulatory shackles on the development of AI in order to stay ahead of China. These groups include Microsoft itself, whose president Brad Smith wrote an impassioned blog post on the topic earlier this week.\n\nWhile a few Indian companies are doing some interesting work on AI, at this point they are nowhere near any significant breakthroughs in technology or product development that would make them leading global players. Microsoft\u2019s $3bn investment in India should also be viewed within the company\u2019s global plans: it expects to spend $80bn this year developing data centres globally, with more than half of that figure invested in the US.\n\nMy take may seem negative about India to some, especially those who feel we should be taking this chance to revel in the praise Nadella has heaped on the country. I see my view as that of a concerned parent urging their child to prepare before an examination. In investing in our technological future, it will serve us better to be ambitious and driven at this point than to be sitting back in smug satisfaction. All I am doing is looking Microsoft\u2019s gift horse in the mouth and finding it to be too small.\n\nKnow an Indian company that is doing groundbreaking work on AI? Tell me about it at indiabrief@ft.com\n\nThe Make in India initiative is paying off, quite literally, in the arms and armaments industry.\u00a0There\u2019s a bull run in stocks of companies that are engaged in defence production. This trend has not gone unnoticed by India\u2019s mutual fund industry, with four large asset management companies launching funds that are dedicated to investing in this sector. Companies such as Hindustan Aeronautics, missile maker Bharat Dynamics and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, the country\u2019s largest naval shipyard, have seen their order books swell as the Modi government pushes the military to shop locally. Consequently, their share prices have significantly outperformed the index.\n\nWhile state-owned companies are still the largest manufacturers of defence equipment, big Indian conglomerates such as the Adani Group, Larsen & Toubro and the Tata Group have started or augmented their investments in the sector in recent years. India is hoping to eventually become an exporter in the arms business, after being the world\u2019s largest importer for more than two decades.\n\nThese are great developments for India\u2019s manufacturing sector as well as the defence industry. I am less enthused about the defence funds. The dominant companies in the sector are government owned, with very little free float in the market. Big fund houses buying and selling this limited float can lead to high price fluctuations, and it is anyone\u2019s guess whether retail investors are aware of these risks.\n\nLaunching funds with sectoral themes to quickly mop up some fresh funds is an old habit in the asset management business, something I remember writing about 20 years ago as a young reporter covering the industry. Every once in a while, it leads to some finger wagging from the regulator and then it is business as usual. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nAs cars get more software heavy, US automakers are seeing an increasing number of software-related car recalls.\n\nI am reading Character Limit: How Elon Musk Destroyed Twitter (love a title that is direct and to the point), written by journalists Kate Conger and Ryan Mac. I first heard about the book on a podcast, Elon\u2019s Spies. The book is a fascinating, and sometimes frightening, insight into how the world\u2019s richest man operates.

Today\u2019s economically dynamic India is his legacy. Almost as significant is the example he gave of intelligent, informed and honourable public service. Singh took ideas seriously, yet was unfailingly courteous and open to the ideas of others. I had the privilege of knowing him from 1974, when I was a senior economist in the World Bank\u2019s India Division and he was the government of India\u2019s chief economic adviser. He was one of the greatest men I have known.\n\nSingh\u2019s most important achievements as a policymaker were made during his years as finance minister from 1991 to 1996. He was appointed, to his surprise, by prime minister PV Narasimha Rao, at a time of a huge foreign exchange crisis. Cometh the hour; cometh the man. He seized the opportunity to deliver radical reform of an anti-trade and anti-market policy regime that had crippled India\u2019s economy since independence. He had known of these errors since he wrote India\u2019s Export Trends, his doctoral thesis at Oxford, published in 1964.\n\nWith the prime minister\u2019s backing, Singh duly transformed India\u2019s policy regime. The reforms ultimately included radical trade liberalisation, deregulation of industry, liberalisation of finance and a shift to a more modern monetary regime, without direct monetary financing of the government by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nThe subsequent transformation in Indian economic performance is dramatic. Over the 41 years from 1950 to 1991, real GDP per head (measured at purchasing power parity) increased by 108 per cent. Over the shorter period of 32 years from 1991 to 2023, it rose by 360 per cent. This was a jump from trend annual growth of 1.6 per cent to one of 5.2 per cent. Roughly speaking, the post-1991 trend and the broad policy regime have persisted ever since.\n\nThe past three decades, then, have transformed India. Whether this will be sustained in the decades ahead is unknown. Whether India will become the developed country it aspires to be in 2047, a century after independence, is also unknown and, in my view, rather unlikely. But India\u2019s population is the largest in the world, at 1.4bn and rising. If growth continues, it will be an economic superpower by then.\n\nYet China\u2019s real GDP per head rose by 1,150 per cent between 1991 and 2023, \u2014 an astounding trend annual rate of 8.4 per cent. Moreover, surprisingly, the share of manufacturing in Indian GDP has fallen, according to the World Bank, not risen, as one would have expected, from 16 per cent in 1991 to 13 per cent in 2023. Again, while ratios of trade to GDP soared after the reforms, they have fallen back somewhat more recently.\n\nInequality also seems to have risen. According to the World Inequality Database, the share in income of the top 1 per cent soared from 10 per cent in 1991 to 23 per cent in 2023, while the share of the top 10 per cent jumped from 35 per cent to 59 per cent. Meanwhile the share of the bottom 50 per cent fell from 20 per cent to 13 per cent. This data is contested. Yet even if true, this would still imply an increase of 180 per cent in the real incomes per head of the bottom 50 per cent over the period. Moreover, by 2023, the average real incomes of the bottom 50 per cent were slightly above the all-India national average in 1991. The absolute number of people in extreme poverty and so the proportion, too, have collapsed. Fast growth is, as always, the most powerful way to eliminate poverty and improve opportunity.\n\nSingh\u2019s period as prime minister from 2004 to 2014 is more controversial than his period as finance minister. He was appointed by the leader of the Congress party, Sonia Gandhi. Indian democratic politics are deeply tainted by money. Yet he remained untainted. Moreover, as Pratap Bhanu Mehta argues, his achievements are underrated, partly because of the defeat by Narendra Modi\u2019s BJP in 2014. Yet they were substantial. They include the nuclear deal with the US, which ended the long-standing friction between the two countries. They also include the national rural employment guarantee scheme of 2005. Not least, in 2009 his government invited Nandan Nilekani of Infosys to launch India\u2019s unique identification system (Aadhaar), on which many of the BJP\u2019s reforms have been based.\n\nSingh was a global asset for India. Montek Singh Ahluwalia, a friend of mine since I joined the World Bank and a close associate of Singh in Indian policymaking, spoke recently about something former US president Barack Obama said of him in the G20 meetings: \u201cWhen the prime minister speaks, the world listens.\u201d\n\nSingh achieved what he did because he was a special man at a special time. Ultimately, however, technocrats only succeed if those with power trust them with it. India benefited from the fact that people with power were willing to trust him to use it well at critical moments. He, in turn, provided something that today\u2019s populists increasingly despise: knowledge, wisdom and experience. He also knew the importance of brilliant colleagues. A recent paper from the Mercatus Center describes him as \u201cIndia\u2019s finest talent scout\u201d. In some quarters today, all this would condemn him as an embodiment of the \u201cdeep state\u201d. That is because these people lack belief in the ideal of public service. Singh did believe in it. He believed, too, in a thriving democracy. Indeed, he thought India could not survive without one.\n\nThe economically dynamic India of today is his legacy. So, too, is his example of service to the cause of a prosperous India in harmony with the world.\n\nmartin.wolf@ft.com\n\nFollow Martin Wolf with\u00a0myFT and on\u00a0X\n\n\u200bLetters in response to this article:How corruption dogged Singh\u2019s second term as PM / From Pradeep S Mehta, Secretary General, Consumer Unity & Trust Society International, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India\n\n\u200bSingh showed reform was possible without autocracy\u00a0/\u00a0From Ismail Kenessy, Dakar, SenegalPraise for Indian taxpayer boondoggle is misplaced / From Nathan Punwani, Scottsdale, AZ, US\n\nSingh\u2019s record does not fit easy left-right pigeonholing\u00a0/\u00a0From Pritam Singh, Professor Emeritus, Oxford Brookes Business School, Oxford, UK", "tag": "india?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/263ea342-b4cf-440c-9ebc-07f2a75ead60"}, {"uuid4": "7db2c1c6-bdde-4095-9017-3f3b7f674c25", "title": "Indian investors rush into highly valued defence stocks", "description": "Asset managers have launched specialist funds as push for domestic armaments sends share prices soaring", "author": "Krishn Kaushik", "published_date": "2025-01-07T02:00:27.404Z", "content": "Retail investors in India are pouring money into defence stocks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s push for domestic arms manufacturing drove the sector index up nearly 56 per cent in a year.\n\nAt least four large asset managers have launched sector-specific funds as experts forecast India\u2019s defence production will grow by as much as 20 per cent a year until the end of the decade.\n\nIndia shares a long, tense border with an increasingly assertive China, and with ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, there is strong demand for weaponry both at home and abroad.\n\nBut whereas New Delhi has been the world\u2019s largest arms importer for more than two decades, Modi is now pushing for the military to buy more weapons at home. He hopes that defence will help to turn India into a global manufacturing hub.\n\nThe drive for indigenisation has led to burgeoning order books at large local companies such as Hindustan Aeronautics, which produces fighters, helicopters and jet engines; Bharat Dynamics, which makes ammunition and missiles; and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, the country\u2019s largest naval shipyard.\n\nLong the domain of state-owned groups, which still account for 85 per cent of arms production, Modi has opened up the sector to private companies, including Adani Group, Larsen & Toubro and Tata Sons. The prime minister has set an annual target of nearly $35bn by the end of the decade for domestic defence production, from about $20bn currently.\n\nA Balasubramanian, chief executive of the asset manager Aditya Birla Sun Life \u2014 which launched a defence fund in August \u2014 said the \u201cvery large and growing order book\u201d at the top companies was a \u201cselling point\u201d for investors.\n\nBut he noted that state-owned companies still dominated the sector and the government maintained a shareholding of about 80 per cent in some of the largest companies.\n\n\u201cUnlike most other spaces that are truly open, this is not an entirely open space,\u201d Balasubramanian said.\n\nThe limited free float in the defence sector means there is a risk that stocks can be squeezed higher by relatively small amounts of investor buying.\n\nWith a market capitalisation of $31.9bn, Hindustan Aeronautics now trades at almost 10 times book value, on a trailing price-to-earnings multiple of 36 times. That implies investors must pay 36 rupees for one rupee of current profits.\n\nHDFC, one of the country\u2019s largest asset managers, was the first to launch a defence-focused fund in June 2023, and has given its investors an annualised return of nearly 73 per cent since then.\n\nThe fund generated so much interest that HDFC closed it for fresh investments this July, due to risks from the \u201ccurrent market valuation, volatility and the narrow universe\u201d, it said.\n\nThree more asset management groups have launched similar schemes after HDFC, tracking the only index for the sector managed by the National Stock Exchange. Motilal Oswal, a stockbroker and asset manager, promotes its fund by asking: \u201cIndia is investing in defence, are you?\u201d\n\nWith returns of nearly 56 per cent in 2024, the Nifty India Defence index has drastically outperformed the 10 per cent return on the wider Nifty 50 benchmark during the same period.\n\nIndia is slowly upgrading its ageing military hardware and desperately needs to buy new fighter jets, tanks, warships and artillery guns, as nearly two-thirds of its military equipment is classified as vintage.\n\nThe government allocated about $20bn for military modernisation for the fiscal year ending March 2025 \u2014 marginally up from $19bn last year \u2014 of which 75 per cent is earmarked for the domestic industry.\n\nA banker managing one defence fund said the total market cap of the sector was minimal 18 months ago, but since then, \u201cwe have seen a very sharp jump, not just in the valuation, but even the number of funds that are tracking\u201d.\n\nApart from the significant financial returns, retail buyers also latch on to an emotional, nationalistic motivation, even when the banks choose not to advertise it.

The government has released rules to govern its data protection regulation: we take a look at some central provisions. I\u2019ll also be keeping an eye on earnings season, which kicks off\u00a0later this week, starting with Tata Consultancy Services on January 9. Plus, India\u2019s forex reserves dip to an eight-month low. But first, where will our data reside?\n\nA year and a half after passage of the digital data protection bill, the government on Friday published the draft rules that will govern it. There were two surprises. First, the government has brought back the data localisation requirement, which prevents technology companies from transferring certain kinds of data out of the country; and second, children under 18 will need parental consent to use social media. However, the details remain vague and bureaucratic.\n\nAccording to its new rules, the government will set up a committee to determine what kind of personal data can be processed by large companies (identified as \u201csignificant data fiduciaries\u201d) such as Meta, Google, Apple and Microsoft. Export of personal data will be subject to restriction by a \u201cgeneral or a specific government order\u201d.\n\nThe government has gone back and forth on the data localisation requirement through various drafts and versions of the bill. In the version that was published in 2020, data localisation was a mandatory condition but after significant lobbying by big tech, the act passed in 2023 merely created a black list of countries for data export. The new draft rules are open for public comment until February 18, and it will be interesting to see if large technology companies manage to push back once again.\n\nThe other significant area is on how minors can use social media. Users who are under 18 will need parental consent and companies must carry out due diligence to establish that the parent is indeed an adult. Yet the entire premise of this regulation hinges on children self-identifying themselves as minors, after which the onus is on technology companies to obtain \u201cverifiable consent\u201d from the parents, who will (presumably) have to upload some kind of government-approved identification to prove their credentials. Companies are prohibited from targeting advertisements at children or tracking their behaviour.\n\nThe government\u2019s intent is to protect children while preserving their access to information online, but the process suggested in the rules is severely flawed. Offenders are liable to strict penalties of up to Rs2bn, so perhaps the government\u2019s strategy is to leave it to technology companies to come up with a solution. However, even they are unlikely to be able to get an errant child to own up to their age online.\n\nDo you have any ideas on how this will work? Write to me at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply.\n\nIndia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have declined to an eight-month low. This is largely due to the gradual but continuous depreciation in the value of the rupee, which has been falling to new lows every week in the last month. Overall, the rupee lost 3 per cent against the dollar in 2024. The Reserve Bank of India has sold dollars from its reserves to prop the rupee up. In December alone the reserves declined by $17.8bn, and now stand at $640.28bn.\n\nThe central bank has a difficult task at hand. It wants to manage the value of the rupee to avoid the economic shock from a sharp fall, and global conditions are not helping. US markets are rallying ahead of a Donald Trump presidency. In China, the government announced a slew of economic stimuli. These measures prompted global investors to sell their holdings of Indian equities and route that money to more lucrative markets abroad. I mentioned previously in India Business Briefing that in October and November, foreign investors sold $13.7bn of Indian equities.\n\nAnalysts expect the dollar to continue to strengthen in the weeks ahead, and most Asian currencies remain weak.

Sure, there\u2019s a handsome stone portico and nicely restored window shutters, but nobody strolling south from the nearby Piazza del Popolo, with its remarkable twin domed basilicas, would have given number 246 a second glance.\n\nThey might now, at least if they were to peek inside.\n\nAfter a 12-year transformation by a Neapolitan multi-millionaire and the late Zaha Hadid, in what would be one of the Iraqi-British architect\u2019s last projects, the palazzo has been reborn as a 74-room luxury hotel. Just before Christmas, I am the first journalist to check in. I\u2019m stunned by what I find \u2014 and not always in a good way.\n\nThe Romeo Roma, which is due to open fully this month after years of delays, is the second hotel from Alfredo Romeo, a 71-year-old entrepreneur, newspaper proprietor, lawyer and property tycoon. His first hotel \u2014 Romeo Napoli \u2014 landed in his hometown in 2008, in a converted 1950s shipping company headquarters.\n\nBy then, Romeo had already set his sights on Rome and in 2012 he spotted the palazzo for sale. Originally developed in the 16th century by the Serroberti family of Perugian apothecaries, it then housed the Capponis until the death in 1746 of Alessandro Gregorio Capponi, a noble collector of literature.\n\nAfter an inheritance feud, the house was altered, rented and then sold off in 1818. It steadily lost its grandeur and most of its original features as it hosted residents as diverse as a deposed Portuguese king and the offices of the National Institute for Insurance Against Accidents at Work.\n\nThe location appealed to Romeo. The area around the Piazza del Popolo, at the northern end of Via del Corso, Rome\u2019s most famous shopping street, had become a high-end hub for the capital\u2019s fashion crowd. Hotels were already part of the draw, with the Palazzo Ripetta and the more famous Hotel de Russie just yards from Romeo\u2019s new doorstep.\n\nThe obvious solution for a neglected old palazzo would have been a restoration, perhaps with a hint of the contemporary. But Rome is not short of lodgings inspired by its rich lasagne of history. With an undisclosed budget that I suspect would have given Nero pause, Romeo was determined to look forwards.\n\nThe Italian says Hadid was intrigued when he first met her in 2014, two years before her sudden death, aged 65. \u201cShe hadn\u2019t created a hotel interior and I wanted her to think of an exclusive design that has never been done before,\u201d Romeo tells me via a translator. His elegant navy blazer and silk tie do not hint at his interest in the avant-garde.\n\nThe results of their brief and at times fraught partnership are startling. I\u2019m talking to Romeo in the hotel bar, which looks out on to a transformed courtyard. He says it\u2019s his favourite space, and it epitomises the wider approach. Which is to say, we are enveloped by extraordinary quantities of expensive, lustrous surfaces.\n\nEbony is the dominant material \u2014 tonnes of it. In many spaces, the ceilings, walls and floors are bedecked in macassar ebony veneer. Its black-and-brown grain flows in curves, ridges, spines and slashes, in a modernist, very Hadidist take on the forms of classical vaulted ceilings. Some of the craftsmanship is breathtaking.\n\nWhere there isn\u2019t ebony, there is enough polished white Carrara marble to have sunk Caligula\u2019s giant barge. In a recurring motif, raised sculptural fireplaces burst out of the walls like huge slashed blisters. Inlaid seams of stainless steel flow along floors and leap up walls. Draped folds of brass shingles shimmer behind twin reception desks, which look as if they have been pulled up from the ground in great basalt fists.\n\nOf the building\u2019s original features, only a marble staircase and a clutch of rooms on the piano nobile had survived intact. There are now five \u201cfresco suites\u201d. In one, a staircase in Krion, a kind of matte porcelain that has also been used extensively, curves around an enormous sculptural bath tub to a space-age mezzanine bedroom. The bed sits right under centuries-old frescoes and an ornate ceiling. It\u2019s a dizzying juxtaposition.\n\nRomeo Roma is nothing if not original, and anyone who cocks a snook at the corporate safe-playing of much of the luxury hotel market is to be admired. But it\u2019s also, well, a lot. I\u2019m told the wood\u2019s marine topcoat was applied to protect Romeo\u2019s investment (he nods when I ask him if his ebony bill alone would have been enough to build a very nice hotel). But the high gloss adds to the overall, slightly claustrophobic feeling of entering a sheikh\u2019s superyacht.\n\nThose sculptural fireplaces are all fake, meanwhile, and have been equipped with remote controlled fake fires with fake logs and a tinny, crackling sound effect. They seem irredeemably naff. But when I diplomatically ask Romeo if he is happy with the way form and fake fire sit together, he says the question hadn\u2019t occurred to him.\n\nRomeo collects benches, and some are comically incongruous (I\u2019m thinking in particular of a bright red metal number in the courtyard that is shaped as a musical stave next to a giant guitar). Then there are the water features. In the palazzo\u2019s now covered original courtyard, where carriages would have disgorged nobles, Romeo has installed a computer-controlled water curtain against the principal wall. A row of dozens of nozzles creates a noisy kind of water screen, lit up with coloured lights, that fleetingly displays the words \u201cRomeo\u201d and \u201cWelcome\u201d as the water falls. It would be a bit much at a Disney resort in Dubai, never mind in the middle of Rome.\n\nBehind the palazzo, a larger new courtyard is bordered by a more recent wing housing a spa and most of the rooms. It includes a remarkable Hadid staircase that rises to a drinks terrace like the rib cage of some cubist whale. But there\u2019s also more rainbow-lit water, flowing from a marble fountain, and down the walls beside a fresco of the Virgin Mary.\n\nRomeo freely admits that, while he admired Hadid greatly, their thinking often diverged. The ebony was his idea, and so were the fireplaces. \u201cIt was mainly the materials we argued about,\u201d he says. \u201cTo her, it was unthinkable that anyone would spend so much to create such structures.\u201d\n\nPerhaps such differing views contributed to the delays; Romeo had hoped to open in 2016. He says it had more to do with a Roman ruin discovered under the modern wing and new courtyard. For almost five years, archaeologists excavated a suspected taverna, along with crates of artefacts. A small bust of Livia Drusilla, wife of Emperor Augustus, now surveys the old courtyard. A swimming pool in the new courtyard incorporates a glass floor above the ruin.\n\nFor all its quixotic vigour, the Romeo triumphs in many areas. Alain Ducasse has done amazing things in the main restaurant, only his second in Italy (the first opened in Romeo Napoli last June). A tasting menu executed by the French food wizard\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and head chef St\u00e9phane Petit, who is 29, is a much defter marriage of old and new, as well as Italian and French (charred puntarelle with anchovy and a delicate pot-au-feu stand out).\n\nThe dining room itself, which looks out on to Via di Ripetta and is mostly clad in ebony, is also remarkable. Square columns flow into vaulted canopies that are backlit through long, slashed perforations. Marble walls and a gleaming open steel kitchen bring more light to the space.\n\nParts of the Sisley spa are also spectacular, including a relaxation room clad in bricks of pink Italian rock salt, and a gym in shaped wood that benefits from having escaped the high-gloss treatment. Lacquered ebony dominates my bedroom, meanwhile, which is nonetheless a masterpiece of modernist cabinetry \u2014 fake fireplace and all.\n\nWhatever one thinks of his vision, Romeo was wise to recruit two creative heavyweights to bring it to life; a rash of openings at the top end of the market in the past five years has included a Six Senses, the Rome Edition, a W, and the Bulgari Hotel, which occupies the hulking 1930s former headquarters of the Italian social security agency (I\u2019ll have your most ironic cocktail).\n\nThey are all modern spaces competing for the same international market, yet none can claim a Hadid or a Ducasse in its marketing. That the Romeo thinks it has an edge is clear in its prices. They start at \u20ac2,450 per night for the smallest digs (rising to \u20ac37,000 for the largest), which is a chunk higher than any of the above properties.\n\nPerhaps Romeo, who plans to open his third hotel on the Amalfi coast later this year, is also trying to claw back some of the money he has poured into the place. At one point, he whispers the total bill, before later asking me not to share it. Let\u2019s just say that, on a per room basis, I suspect you would struggle to find a costlier hotel.\n\n\u201cIt seems unsustainable from a financial point of view,\u201d Romeo tells me with half a smile, before supervising the repositioning of a new sofa near his digital water curtain. \u201cBut beauty is always an investment.\u201d\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nA hotel so appealing it\u2019s hard to tear yourself away / From Michael Webb, Architectural Writer, Los Angeles, CA, US", "tag": "india?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0ed6d781-8d51-4df1-b6bb-2d24144a7575"}, {"uuid4": "4b681e2a-47a9-429a-a4f9-b70bf2c25066", "title": "India\u2019s next digital payments boom", "description": "Also in this newsletter: Is India\u2019s stock market run waning and some New Year\u2019s Eve party stats  ", "author": "Veena Venugopal", "published_date": "2025-01-03T01:30:21.771Z", "content": "Good morning and happy new year. In a move that will significantly widen and deepen the digital payments ecosystem, WhatsApp will now be allowed to roll out its payment service to all users. In today\u2019s newsletter, I also look at whether India\u2019s two-year stock market run is coming to an end. In cricket, the fifth test match of the Border-Gavaskar series started in Sydney today, and your social media feeds are probably already full of Rohit Sharma drama. But first, what\u2019s up on WhatsApp?\n\nIndia\u2019s robust digital payments infrastructure is set to explode now that WhatsApp is being given a free run by the country\u2019s digital payments regulator, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). Until Tuesday, the popular messaging service had not been allowed to offer its payment service beyond a fraction of its users (100mn). With this restriction now lifted, WhatsApp can proceed to roll out the service to its full base, estimated at more than 500mn users. This move will widen the base of transacting accounts for the Unified Payments Interface \u2014 the technology that enables digital payment transactions in India \u2014 and increase its depth.\n\nOn Tuesday, the NPCI (which was clearly busy at work on the last day of 2024) also extended the deadline to comply with a market share cap that restricts digital payment firms from accounting for more than 30 per cent of the volume of transactions processed through the UPI. Firms now have two more years to meet this requirement, good news for Walmart-backed PhonePe and Google Pay, which have 47.8 per cent and 37 per cent of all UPI transactions respectively. Both of these companies would have had to clip back their service after Tuesday had this extension not come through.\n\nClearly, the governing body\u2019s intent is to build on the early success of UPI and significantly expand the market. There is no doubt that the pervasiveness of digital payments, their ease of use and widespread acceptance, has helped transform our everyday financial lives. However, fraud remains a concern. Rolling out payments to all WhatsApp users leaves a large chunk of people who are financially or technologically inept vulnerable to scams.\n\nOther than running vague advertisements that put the onus of caution on users, WhatsApp parent Meta has done little to educate users about safe in-app digital payments. I have myself been surprised by how quickly WhatsApp pay options pop up on my screen every time I click on a QR code from my image gallery, despite the fact that I have neither signed up nor used the service. Frictionless transactions will also enable fraud in the blink of an eye. While opening up the market, it is imperative that the regulator imposes strict guidelines on WhatsApp to minimise fraud, educate users, and insure them against dubious transactions.\n\nAm I being overcautious?

Foreign portfolio investors sold a record $11.2bn of Indian stocks in October and a further $2.5bn in November. There were both push and pull factors at play here. In September 2024, China announced a series of stimulus measures, which led to investors liquidating their India positions to invest in Shanghai. On the push side, slowing consumption and GDP growth in India are real concerns in the economy. These, added to the high valuation that stocks were at, made Indian stocks a difficult buy.\n\nDecember was a slightly different story though. Foreign investors were net buyers during the month, even if the amount\u00a0was relatively modest, at $1.97bn. And there was even more heartening news this week when auto sales numbers were published. Maruti Suzuki reported a 30 per cent increase in total sales compared with November and Mahindra & Mahindra sold 16 per cent more vehicles. Hyundai Motor reported a dip of 2.4 per cent in December sales, but the company achieved its highest-ever annual sales in the year. Are these signs of green shoots? It\u2019s too early to tell. But in times like these, perhaps we should celebrate these small wins \u2014 and keep our fingers firmly crossed.\n\nBullish or bearish \u2014 what is your view on the Indian stock market for 2025?

Quick commerce companies posted some interesting facts about what people ordered on December 31. Here are some highlights.\n\nDo you have any new year resolutions? An interesting survey I saw on Statista suggested that in the US, the top trending resolution for 2025 is to save more money (21 per cent). This was followed by the usual suspects \u2014 to eat more healthily (19 per cent), to exercise more (17 per cent)\u00a0 and to lose weight (15 per cent). Some 9 per cent want to quit smoking, but an equal number want to reduce their spending on living expenses such as food and energy costs (how?!). And the biggest chunk of people? They have no resolutions at all (43 per cent).\n\nI don\u2019t often make resolutions myself, although I give myself some goals to chase. I have two for this year \u2014 reduce my screen time as reported by my iPhone every Sunday and take the metro to work (instead of driving) at least three times a week. For the first quarter of the year, in solidarity with a friend\u2019s resolution, I will not be buying any non-essentials. That will be the hardest one.\n\nHave you made yours?

A further $2.5bn was offloaded in November.\n\nAnalysts say that \u201cpull\u201d factors were at play, with China\u2019s recent stimulus measures luring back some foreign investors. Many foreign investors had also struggled to buy into the India fervour because of lofty stock valuations.\n\n\u201cThere is a wide acknowledgment that there is a slowdown,\u201d said Aditya Suresh, head of India equity research at Macquarie Capital. \u201cWhat people are grappling with is [the] duration: how long?\u201d\n\nInternational markets had cheered India\u2019s economic resurgence since the Covid-19 pandemic, with Franklin Templeton in 2023 anointing the world\u2019s most populous country the \u201cnext China\u201d. Morgan Stanley foretold \u201cIndia\u2019s decade\u201d, pointing to an \u201ceconomic boom\u201d led by offshoring, manufacturing, green energy and advanced digital infrastructure.\n\nIndian companies rushed to sell shares, buoyed by domestic investors ploughing savings into exuberant public markets, while the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy joined benchmark bond indices in 2024.\n\nBut India has begun to lose some of its momentum. GDP growth in the quarter ended September came in at just 5.4 per cent year on year, the lowest rate in nearly two years. The Reserve Bank of India in November cut its growth forecast for the 2024-25 financial year from 7.2 per cent to 6.6 per cent.\n\nCore industries such as mining, manufacturing \u2014 the focus of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s flagship \u201cMade in India\u201d push \u2014 and construction also sagged in the quarter.\n\nGross value added growth, which measures actual production value, for manufacturing dropped to 2.15 per cent, from 14.3 per cent rate in the September quarter last year. Construction sector GVA also slowed.\n\nMacquarie analysts pointed to a series of factors behind India\u2019s slowdown, including weaker government spending during an election year, following a yearlong infrastructure drive, and severe monsoon rains that disrupted economic activity.\n\nThey also noted that Indian households were increasingly struggling as wage growth has failed to keep pace with high inflation, while a central bank crackdown on unsecured loans and retail credit has weakened spending, forcing many families to dip into savings already depleted by the pandemic.\n\nIn October, headline inflation accelerated to more than 6 per cent, above the RBI\u2019s target band of 4 to 6 per cent. Despite moderating in November to 5.5 per cent, the RBI has continued to hold its key lending rate at 6.5 per cent since early 2023 \u2014 drawing outcry from ministers in New Delhi, who say high borrowing costs are hurting businesses.\n\nIndia\u2019s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in December that the drop in economic growth was a \u201ctemporary blip\u201d. But many economists believe the slowdown is not just seasonal, pointing to a drop in spending among overleveraged urban and middle-class Indians.\n\nSales growth for fast-moving consumer goods slowed to just 2.8 per cent in the September quarter, from 11 per cent in the same period last year, according to NielsenIQ. Largely poorer rural areas are now outpacing urban growth rates.\n\nThe RBI has also voiced repeated concerns over the past year on the rapid growth in consumer loans and credit card debt, and demanded lenders allocate more capital against their exposure to rein in bank borrowing.\n\n\u201cThere is a moderation in income, there is a moderation in credit availability,\u201d said Sonal Varma, a Singapore-based economist at Nomura.\n\n\u201cUrban consumption is important because if it doesn\u2019t pick up and exports are weak, then capacity utilisation is not going to move up\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[and] the private investment cycle that everybody has been hoping to take off for many years now will not be able to by next year.\u201d\n\nMacquarie\u2019s Suresh said the cumulative impact of a more than 35 per cent rise of food and beverage inflation since 2020 has also eroded spending power among hundreds of millions of India\u2019s poor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a quick fix here for this,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if there was a shot in the arm, it\u2019s a sugar rush rather than a lasting solution. The duration\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009may not be as straightforward as one quarter or two.\u201d\n\nSluggish investment by Indian companies, which reported a weak set of earnings in the third quarter, is another factor, impeding the creation of much-needed formal jobs, economists said.\n\n\u201cSince investments have been very low for a fairly long time, the economy has not generated enough jobs of the good kind that lead to a bump in consumer spending,\u201d said Mahesh Vyas, chief executive of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.\n\nCorporate investments\u2019 share of GDP has declined in recent years, dropping from about 25 per cent in the 2008 fiscal year to about 13-14 per cent since the 2020 fiscal year, according to analysis from financial group Motilal Oswal.\n\nNomura\u2019s Varma believes demand has not picked up to a level to \u201ctrigger new capacity expansion\u201d and that cheap imports from neighbouring rival China have provided a disincentive for Indian corporates from investing to expand domestic output.\n\nGoing into 2025, many economists expect an easing of monetary policy as a new RBI governor takes the helm, as well as an increase in government spending.\n\nNevertheless, \u201cmomentum is going to be softer\u201d, said Varma. \u201cWe think this is going to last for at least another six months.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b667ccd3-b066-4308-8d6f-8ee0a08f635e"}, {"uuid4": "5ed6e9fa-8cfd-48be-934d-f1fc042d3549", "title": "Three dates in 2025 that\u2019ll set the tone for India", "description": "Also in this newsletter: health insurers\u2019 claims record, and how Rishad Premji stays sharp  ", "author": "Veena Venugopal", "published_date": "2024-12-31T01:32:51.592Z", "content": "Good morning. On the last day of the year, it is tempting to gaze into the future and make big predictions. But I\u2019ll resist adding to the slew of \u201coutlook 2025\u201d reports out there (some FT favourites: what investors need to look out for; FT Alphaville fed ChatGPT some investment outlook reports; and what to read in 2025). Instead, let\u2019s take a look at three big dates in the first quarter of the coming year that will have a significant impact on our businesses and economy.\u00a0Mark your calendars!\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s inauguration day, and perhaps this time the headlines will not be about the size of the crowd. For India, the big issue at this stage is Trump\u2019s threats to impose reciprocal tariffs. The US is India\u2019s biggest trading partner, accounting for $77.5bn worth of goods and 18 per cent of total exports. Without knowing the specifics of what Trump plans to do (this will probably be a common tune for the next four years), it is difficult to predict how exactly it will impact the Indian economy.\u00a0Analysts predict the damage to be anything between 0.3 and 0.8 per cent of GDP. The government is trying to stay one step ahead, with officials running sector by sector analyses and drawing up negotiation strategies to minimise the damage to the economy.\n\nFor Indians, the other main area of concern will be the H-1B visas the US issues for foreign workers in \u201cspecialty occupations\u201d. As of 2023, nearly 73 per cent of H-1B visa holders were Indians. Since the programme is tilted towards technology and software jobs, providing onshore IT professionals has been a reliable business model for software companies as well as a robust career path for Indian software professionals. But battle lines over the number of Indians in the US with H-1B visas have already been drawn. While Trump\u2019s adviser, \u201cFirst Buddy\u201d Elon Musk, sees it as a critical route to recruit talented engineers, the president-elect\u2019s Maga base has hit out at what it sees as more jobs going to immigrants. Trump has backed Musk \u2014 but for how long?\n\nMuch like an Indian Premier League match or a Diwali blockbuster, excitement about the Union Budget is a uniquely Indian thing and we are here for it. With lower than expected GDP growth and higher than anticipated inflation, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has her task cut out for her. Preparations are in full swing. Last week, the prime minister met economists and policy experts at Niti Aayog (formerly the Planning Commission) to thrash out strategies for the Budget, and Sitharaman chaired the fourth pre-Budget consultation with experts from various industry sectors.\n\nFebruary\u2019s Budget will set the tone for Narendra Modi\u2019s third term as prime minister, and it will be interesting to see what the government prioritises. I\u2019m betting on three central areas: one, sectors that will generate employment, including those that require a large number of gig workers; two, expansion of the government\u2019s capital expenditure plans in order to restart growth momentum; and three, some tax sops for the middle class, whose grumbles about paying money and not getting much in return have only grown louder in recent years.\n\nThe challenge of balancing the books continues to be tricky, with an ever-widening current account deficit. On social media, Sitharaman gets a lot of criticism for her stern expression and straight talk. But who can blame her? Her job sounds like it will rob anyone of all joy.\n\nNewly appointed Reserve Bank of India governor, Sanjay Malhotra, will announce his first decision on interest rates. The government wants the central bank to cut rates to jump-start growth. Last week, a finance ministry report directly attributed the recent slowdown in demand to the RBI\u2019s monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. This lends credibility to the whispers early in the month that former governor Shaktikanta Das was denied an extension of his term because of his reluctance to cut rates, but let\u2019s not get bogged down by arguments of correlation and causality now.\n\nThe RBI\u2019s December meeting was the 11th consecutive time the central bank decided to hold rates in order to battle soaring inflation. It is reasonable to expect that Malhotra will want to keep the finance ministry happy; who among us has not strategised to establish early success in a new job? But the question is whether the inflation gods will be kind to him. To my mind, it is unlikely that there will be a sharp drop in the headline number. Further, global uncertainties are only worsening, and who knows what a fortnight of Trump\u2019s America will unleash. These conditions are not ideal for a rate cut, but as my last act of bravado for 2024, I\u2019m going to stick my neck out and say there will be one. (Will I crow about this or eat crow?

It also exports to more than 30 countries.\n\nThe divestment comes as Indian food companies have struggled with weak demand among hundreds of millions of poor and middle-class households, who have been hit by heightened inflation and scaled back their spending.\n\nAdani Wilmar\u2019s operating income fell 41 per cent in the last financial year to about $90mn after it was hit by declining food oil prices and losses at its Bangladesh subsidiary, although its latest quarterly earnings have since shown a recovery, according to Indian credit rating agency Care Ratings.\n\nBut the company\u2019s stock has also fallen 12 per cent this year, compared with the 8.8 per cent gain of India\u2019s blue-chip Nifty 50 index.\n\nNeither Adani nor Wilmar referenced the US charges in their statements on the decision.\n\nThe Adani Group has denied any wrongdoing in response to the US allegations, while Gautam Adani said \u201cevery attack makes us stronger\u201d after the indictment.\n\nAdani Group\u2019s international ventures have come under increased scrutiny since the US indictment, with Kenya\u2019s President William Ruto cancelling $2.6bn in proposed deals and Bangladesh probing a cross-border electricity deal.\n\nThis article has been changed since publication to give a correct figure for Adani Wilmar\u2019s operating income.", "tag": "india?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7a3edf8a-f8ea-46f7-8264-c023f8f9158f"}, {"uuid4": "c373f954-9aa6-4389-be98-103b9916aac0", "title": "What the \u2018year of democracy\u2019 taught us, in 6 charts", "description": "The billions who voted in 2024 sent an angry message to incumbents, and warmed to populists on left and right", "author": "John Burn-Murdoch", "published_date": "2024-12-30T05:00:19.406Z", "content": "It was heralded as the year of democracy. With more than one and a half billion ballots cast in elections across 73 countries, 2024 offered a rare opportunity to take the social and political temperature of almost half of the world\u2019s population.\n\nThe results are now in, and they have delivered a damning verdict on holders of public office.\n\nThe incumbent in every one of the 12 developed western countries that held national elections in 2024 lost vote share at the polls, the first time this has ever happened in almost 120 years of modern democracy. In Asia, even the hegemonic governments of India and Japan were not spared the ill wind.\n\nIncumbent or otherwise, centrists were frequently the losers as voters threw in their lot behind radical parties of either flank. The populist right in particular surged forward, fuelled in significant part by a rightward shift among young men.\n\nThe results paint a picture of angry electorates stung by record inflation, fed up with economic stagnation, disquieted by rising immigration, and increasingly disillusioned with the system as a whole.\n\nIn a sense, the year of democracy produced a cry that democracy is no longer working, with the younger generation, many voting for the first time, delivering some of the strongest rebukes against the establishment.\n\nOn average across the developed world, incumbents\u2019 vote share fell by seven percentage points in 2024, an all-time record and more than double the decline as electorates punished elected officials in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\n\nThe range of countries producing similar results points to a common undercurrent, with inflation the obvious culprit.\n\nComing into 2024, high and rising prices were the public\u2019s top concern in the vast majority of the countries going to the polls. While recessions are deeply unpopular, their impacts are unevenly distributed. Inflation stings everyone.\n\nBut if the cost of living crisis acted as a handicap on incumbents, a closer look across different countries and regions shows that it was far from the only driver of discontent.\n\nThe biggest backlash against a sitting government came in Britain, where the Conservatives\u2019 charge sheet included not only high prices but a corruption scandal, a crisis in public healthcare provision, a self-inflicted economic shock and a sharp spike in immigration.\n\nAcross the channel in France, president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s attempt to fend off the populist right by calling snap legislative elections backfired. The resulting political chaos is yet to be fully resolved months later.\n\nIn India, Narendra Modi\u2019s formidable Bharatiya Janata party machine secured a narrow victory but lost its parliamentary majority, struggling to hold back the tide of dissatisfaction over the increasing disconnect between strong economic growth and weak job creation.\n\nThis was particularly pronounced among young people, whose unemployment rate climbed to almost 50 per cent ahead of the election, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.\n\nEven the exceptions to the anti-incumbent wave are less anomalous when considered in the context of other central themes of the year\u2019s political shifts.\n\nIn Mexico and Indonesia respectively, Claudia Sheinbaum and Prabowo Subianto each improved upon the margin of the sitting president. In both cases, they ran broad campaigns pledging continuity with their anti-elitist predecessors, illustrating the near-universal success of populists over the past twelve months. Prabowo also leaned heavily on dominance of the new social media landscape, another common theme.\n\nViewed across the world as a whole, the weak performance of centrist parties and the march of populists, particularly on the right, was just as strong a theme as the anti-incumbent wave, perhaps stronger.\n\nEven the Labour party\u2019s victory in Britain is no exception here, as it won this year with fewer votes than in either of the two previous elections it lost. And just months after a landslide victory, opinion has turned sharply against both party and leader.\n\nThe French public\u2019s souring on Macron and his centrist party, meanwhile, reflects the wider global mood of disillusionment with the political establishment, and the sense that elected officials either don\u2019t know or don\u2019t care what ordinary people think.\n\nAlthough ultimately falling narrowly short of its hoped-for victory, the 15-point swing achieved by France\u2019s Rassemblement National in parliamentary elections was the largest recorded by any party in any developed country this year. The second, third and fourth-biggest gains of the year were all by fellow rightwing populists in the form of Austria\u2019s Freedom party, Britain\u2019s Reform UK and Portugal\u2019s Chega.\n\nThis speaks to the fact that immigration has been a rising concern across the developed world in recent years, and was one of the key issues on voters\u2019 minds as they went to the polls.\n\nWhere conservative parties lost ground, it was generally parties outflanking them on the right who were the main beneficiaries. The success of Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK in peeling off Conservative voters in Britain has been widely attributed to the latter\u2019s failure to meet its promise to reduce immigration numbers.\n\nBut anti-establishment successes were not limited to the right. The Greens in the UK were one of a smattering of radical leftwing parties that also gained ground as voters disillusioned with a stale centre broke in both directions.\n\nWhile the timing and magnitude of the anti-incumbent wave point primarily to the short-term shock of higher prices, the populist surge looks more like the continuation \u2014 or perhaps acceleration \u2014 of a trend that has been playing out in a growing number of countries over two decades at least.\n\nOne prominent theory for why we\u2019re seeing this unfold was laid out in an influential paper published earlier this year by a team of Harvard economists, who found that people who grow up against a backdrop of weaker economic growth and less progress between generations are more likely to view the world as zero sum, where one person\u2019s gain must come at someone else\u2019s cost.\n\nThe steady decrease in upward economic mobility in rich countries could thus explain much of the rise in these views, which tend to be associated with support for parties and politicians on both left and right that promise to tear up the existing system or to protect against external threats.\n\nOne further possibility is that the dramatic changes to the media landscape over the past two decades have played a part in eroding previously long-standing norms against populist rhetoric and talking points. The emergence of social media has made it easier for political outsiders to speak directly to the public, levelling a playing field that had previously tilted towards established figures and parties.\n\nBeneath the surface of the headline results, one of the most striking patterns seen in country after country has been the rise in support for the populist right among young men.\n\nIn Britain, support for Reform is now higher among men in their late teens and early twenties than among those in their thirties, and a marked gender gap has opened up among the youngest voters. A very similar pattern can be seen in the US, where young men also swung sharply towards Donald Trump in November, and the same pattern appears across much of Europe.\n\nNotably, there appears to be plenty of room for this trend to continue: the share saying they would consider voting for the radical right is even higher than those who already have.\n\nSuch a pronounced shift is startling, but is not without plausible explanation. If discontent with economic stagnation drives zero-sum attitudes, few groups have experienced such a flatlining as young men, whose relative socio-economic status has been in steady decline across the west.\n\nBut it\u2019s not only young men moving to the extremes. Young women in the US also swung towards Trump, while in the UK they shifted heavily to the Greens.\n\nThis fits with research from the polling company FocalData earlier this year, which found young people far more likely than their elders to support a hypothetical national populist party, and a 2020 study which found satisfaction with democracy in the developed west plummeting further and faster among young adults than any other group.\n\nAll indications are that both defining trends of 2024 are set to continue next year. The latest polls show the incumbent governments of Australia, Canada, Germany and Norway all on course to lose power in the coming months.\n\nAnd in most of these countries it is once again the populist right that looks set to make the biggest gains. Norway\u2019s rightwing populist Progress party currently leads after finishing fourth in 2021, and Germany\u2019s AfD are currently polling in second place.\n\nThe acute inflation crisis may have passed, but with stubbornly weak economic growth, a widening generational wealth gap and a fragmented media, 2024 may prove to be less an anomaly than one particularly jagged point on a downward trend.", "tag": "india?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/350ba985-bb07-4aa3-aa5e-38eda7c525dd"}, {"uuid4": "baee91ca-60e6-466d-a614-1871543ebdca", "title": "India is overlooking the climate drag on its economic growth", "description": "The country\u2019s climate-neutral GDP forecasts require urgent revision", "author": "Parag Khanna", "published_date": "2024-12-29T12:00:10.505Z", "content": "The writer is the founder and chief executive of AlphaGeo and author of \u2018The Future is Asian\u2019\n\nThe November COP29 summit ended predictably: a last-minute, watered-down commitment to support developing countries in their urgent climate adaptation efforts was delivered. India\u2019s delegate then led the equally predictable outcry with a fiery diatribe against the paltry sums promised. India is right to worry: it is facing a combustible mix of climate volatility and demographic vulnerability from being an overpopulated poor country.\n\nThere is a widespread consensus that India will be the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy for the next decade and perhaps beyond. The World Bank recently upped its growth forecast for the country from 6.6 per cent to 7 per cent in the fiscal year to next March 31. Yet India still faces major economic headwinds such as slow structural reforms, trade barriers, too heavy banking sector regulation and high youth unemployment.\n\nAnd almost entirely ignored in the heady growth forecasts is the role of climate change. This is in spite of environmental shifts beginning to bite into India\u2019s corporate sector. Leading food delivery app Zomato cited heat stress in explaining its lower-than-expected Q1 earnings, and infrastructure giant Larsen & Toubro is shifting working hours to adapt to searing heat. Ironically, during the COP summit, India\u2019s air pollution reached record levels, with schools closed and flights grounded.\n\nAsia as a whole \u2014 and south Asia in particular \u2014 is bearing the brunt of global climate volatility. Asia now accounts for more than half of global greenhouse gas emissions, which have in turn led to record-breaking heatwaves, droughts, floods, hurricanes and rising sea levels. More than 80 per cent of India\u2019s people live in districts that are at risk of climate-induced disasters, according to the World Bank.\n\nIn October, the Asian Development Bank warned that climate change could hit India\u2019s GDP by as much as 25 per cent by 2070. This is not unrealistic: a third of India\u2019s GDP is linked to nature-related sectors. Increasingly frequent droughts are threatening agricultural output, a \u201cday zero\u201d water event, in which all water sources dry up, has already hit Chennai and heatwaves are stressing the electricity grid. India\u2019s most recent official Economic Survey claims that the country is spending more than 5 per cent of GDP on climate adaptation.\n\nIt is also important to note that one of India\u2019s most significant exports is people. Climate stress will only accelerate the brain drain to countries with a more temperate climate and labour shortages.\u00a0That will in turn have an economic impact.\n\nIt is clear that climate-neutral growth forecasts for India need a systematic correction. The nascent field of climate econometrics is making welcome progress on this more generally. Swiss Re has issued dire warnings about the aggregate hit to global GDP from increasing climate stress. S&P considers climate hazards \u2014 sea level rise, extreme heat, flooding \u2014 to calculate GDP at risk and the ability of countries to avoid and respond to some of these losses based on their economic and institutional strength.\n\nBut the impact of climate change on India\u2019s growth prospects also needs to be looked at more from the bottom up. At AlphaGeo, we have calculated a revised GDP outlook for each state, considering factors such as population density, the sectoral composition of its economy, climate hazard exposure and a composite of metrics such as the reliability of energy grids and flood control measures.\n\nWe estimate that India\u2019s GDP will rise up from $3.97tn today to $7.75tn by 2030. This represents a climate correction of about $500bn from the Ministry of Finance\u2019s projections for state-level growth that suggest an aggregated trajectory to $8.26tn at the end of the decade \u2014 a substantial penalty for a developing country, to say nothing of the human toll it represents.\n\nIndia needs climate econometrics that capture more granular data on the real-time impact of natural disasters on supply chains and commercial activity. This is possible by methods such as collecting satellite imagery of night-time lights and real-time commercial transaction data. But even a perfect digital twin of the economy is less useful than pragmatic measures such as flood controls, water desalination and communal cooling centres that ensure population health and infrastructural resilience.\n\nLiving up to India\u2019s dreams of superpower status will require nothing less. India may yet remain the fastest-growing large economy, but this will only remain the case if climate adaptation becomes a strategic priority for the government, corporates and investors.", "tag": "india?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/927a4c8b-db4c-4a46-af68-71c5a03452ab"}, {"uuid4": "c0814451-760e-4aeb-907d-c67d46ad172f", "title": "Manmohan Singh, former Indian prime minister, 1932-2024  ", "description": "As finance minister, he paved the way for a transformative liberalisation of the state-controlled economy", "author": "James Lamont", "published_date": "2024-12-26T21:49:18.006Z", "content": "India\u2019s former prime minister Manmohan Singh, who died aged 92 on Thursday, launched a transformative liberalisation of the state-controlled economy during a 1991 currency crisis, putting the country on a long-term trajectory of faster growth and rising global influence.\n\nAs finance minister from 1991 until 1996, Singh overcame entrenched political resistance to end decades of isolation and stagnation, open India\u2019s doors to greater foreign trade and private investment, and begin its integration into the global economy.\n\nThe Oxford-trained economist, known for his mild, self-effacing manner and personal integrity, was subsequently tapped by Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born Congress party leader, to serve as premier after the party\u2019s shock electoral victory in 2004.\n\nSingh was considered by Gandhi a safe, technocratic choice to lead India, who would not emerge as a political rival to her or her young son, Rahul, whom she was grooming to eventually take over the party leadership.\n\nDuring his premiership, Singh\u2019s hope of continuing India\u2019s economic reforms was thwarted by Congress\u2019s coalition partners, which objected to many of the measures he wished to pursue.\n\nHis second term in office from 2009 was seen as opportunity to press ahead with more dramatic reforms. But he ended up weak and isolated within his party as high-profile corruption scandals plagued his administration.\n\nBorn in 1932 in a rural village in what is today part of Pakistan, Singh, a member of the Sikh faith, migrated to India when British-ruled India was divided into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.\n\nHe attended university in India, then obtained a degree from Cambridge and a PhD in economics from Oxford, writing a thesis and book entitled \u201cIndia\u2019s Export Trends and Prospects for Sustained Growth\u201d.\n\nIt challenged India\u2019s then pervasive export pessimism that was to blight its development for a further three decades. Singh subsequently worked for several years at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\n\nIn 1969, he returned to India to teach economics. Then in 1971, Singh took up a post as economic adviser in the commerce ministry, the start of a long career in government service in which he held many top posts, including governor of the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nBut his fundamental role in transforming India came in 1991, as it was facing a severe foreign exchange crisis, which had forced the country to fly some of its gold reserves abroad as security for an IMF rescue loan.\n\nSingh seized the opportunity to break with the antitrade world view that had dominated India post-independence, and begin the process of opening up the country\u2019s tightly controlled, socialist-oriented economy to greater private and foreign investment, bringing an end to an era of chronically low growth.\n\nHis steps, alongside prime minister PV Narasimha Rao, to dismantle the so-called \u201cLicence Raj\u201d of strict economic controls during his five-year tenure as finance minister laid the foundation for a rapid acceleration of India\u2019s economic growth, hitting highs of nearly 9 per cent, up from an average of around 2 to 3 per cent.\n\nIn his first term as prime minister from 2004, Singh created debt relief and job creation schemes for farmers, and sought to establish social welfare programmes to assist those yet to benefit from India\u2019s accelerated growth.\n\nHe also tried to bring more transparency to government by implementing a freedom of information law, similar to those in the west.\n\nBut the most significant achievement was his transformation of New Delhi\u2019s relationship with Washington, which had imposed sanctions on India for its nuclear tests a decade earlier.\n\nIn 2008, he staked his political future on a quest to obtain parliamentary approval for a major civil nuclear agreement with the US, in spite of opposition from leftist former coalition partners and the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party.\n\nThe successful parliamentary vote buried the legacy of cold war animosity between the two countries despite India\u2019s refusal to relinquish its nuclear weapons programme, while sealing Singh\u2019s unlikely friendship with the then-US president George W Bush.\n\nLater that year, after Pakistan-based militants launched a seaborne terror strike on Mumbai, killing 170 people, Singh showed considerable restraint by resisting calls for harsh retaliation, thus averting a potential regional conflagration.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, many of Singh\u2019s advisers said he should have handed the premiership over to a younger leader after the election victory of 2009.\n\nHis second term was one of bitter disappointment and paralysis, marred by corruption scandals, unruly allies and an economy retreating from double-digit economic growth amid stubbornly high inflation.\n\nHowever, during this time, he did empower Nandan Nilekani, cofounder of tech giant Infosys, to lead a team that built an advanced biometric identification system known as Aadhaar, which gradually led to vast improvements in the delivery of welfare payments for millions of poorer Indians.\n\nStill, public disillusionment with Singh\u2019s seeming inaction as economic and political conditions deteriorated paved the way for the 2014 election of the BJP leader Narendra Modi, who promised muscular leadership, faster job creation and accelerated growth.\n\nSingh kept a low profile after retirement, though he did make occasional public criticisms of his successor\u2019s performance. In 2019 he accused Modi of creating a \u201ctoxic\u201d environment and \u201cclimate of fear\u201d that had led to a sharp economic slowdown by undermining business confidence.\n\nDuring his final months as premier, back in 2014, Singh predicted that \u201chistory will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter opposition parties\u201d.\n\nLetter in response to this obituary:\n\nWhen Manmohan Singh left me lost for words / From Richard Lambert, former FT Editor", "tag": "india?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0eeb0d5e-3e6b-4f00-ba26-f7b0ac51de2c"}, {"uuid4": "b412a0e8-cd91-4cec-9ecc-3c0d593b9481", "title": "India\u2019s former prime minister Manmohan Singh dies", "description": "Oxford-educated economist liberalised the country\u2019s economy and paved the way for strong growth", "author": "Krishn Kaushik", "published_date": "2024-12-26T19:24:38.428Z", "content": "India\u2019s former prime minister Manmohan Singh, who liberalised the economy and then led the country through a period of strong economic growth, has died.\n\nSingh, 92, was being treated for age-related medical conditions, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi said, as it announced his death on Thursday.\n\nThe Oxford university-educated economist set India on a path to becoming a fast-growing economy as finance minister from 1991 to 1996, when he opened up the country to more foreign trade and private investment.\n\nConsidered a political lightweight by some in India at that time, Singh was a surprise choice by the Congress party to be prime minister after it won parliamentary elections in 2004.\n\nAlongside a growth rate of almost 7 per cent, Singh\u2019s decade as premier was marred by allegations of widespread corruption against his party\u2019s leaders, although his personal integrity was rarely questioned.\n\nSingh was accused of inaction and opposition parties claimed he was subservient to Sonia Gandhi, Congress\u2019s chief at that time.\n\nShortly before Congress lost elections to Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party in 2014, Singh said in a speech to parliament that \u201chistory would be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter opposition parties\u201d.\n\nPrime Minister Modi on Thursday described Singh as one of India\u2019s most distinguished leaders, saying he left a \u201cstrong imprint on our economic policy over the years\u201d and had \u201cmade extensive efforts to improve people\u2019s lives\u201d as premier.\n\nRahul Gandhi, a senior member of the Congress party, paid tribute to Singh, saying he had lost a \u201cmentor and guide\u201d whose \u201chumility and deep understanding of economics inspired the nation\u201d.\n\nA member of parliament for more than three decades, Singh retired from active politics earlier this year.\n\nThe mild-mannered Singh, who belonged to India\u2019s minority Sikh community, was born to a humble family in 1932 in a village in India\u2019s Punjab province prior to the country\u2019s independence, which is now part of Pakistan.\n\nSingh rose to become one of India\u2019s most successful economists, serving the government in various capacities, including as head of the central bank in the 1980s.", "tag": "india?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/66ad6592-3764-443e-9298-e3fa30218e2d"}, {"uuid4": "2793e47f-0e34-4af8-a608-390cc2015b46", "title": "India roars ahead of China to top Asian IPO rankings", "description": "Fast-growing Indian market behind only the US in money raised by company listings", "author": "Krishn Kaushik", "published_date": "2024-12-26T05:00:22.565Z", "content": "India has eclipsed China as Asia\u2019s top market for company listings this year, as buoyant stock prices spark a boom in initial public offerings.\n\nPropelled by companies including Swiggy and Hyundai Motor, India will be the world\u2019s second-largest equity fundraising market behind the US for the first time, according to data from Dealogic for 2024.

Meanwhile, companies have rushed to take advantage of high valuations following a multiyear rally in Indian equities, despite concerns over whether the market can weather an economic slowdown.\u201cIt\u2019s been one of the most busiest times in the history of Indian capital markets,\u201d said V Jayasankar, a managing director at Kotak Investment Banking, which worked on some of the country\u2019s biggest IPOs this year. \u201cIndia is certainly getting noticed \u2014 China needs to probably do a lot more to really consistently attract that business.\u201dThe market has been buoyed by \u201cvery solid\u201d Indian domestic flows thanks to a significant \u201cdemocratisation of investment\u201d as households increasingly pour money into local equity markets, Jayasankar added. \u201cThe overall activity has taken us by a positive surprise.\u201d\n\nThe value of primary and secondary listings in mainland China, which in 2023 was the world\u2019s largest market, fell about 86 per cent from more than $48bn to just $7.5bn in 2024 by early December, according to Dealogic.\n\nAnalysts said that a weaker economy coupled with restrictive regulation on company listings has held up the pipeline of Chinese companies looking to enter public markets, although the announcement of monetary and fiscal stimulus plans in September has helped to stabilise markets after a sell-off earlier in the year.\n\nChina\u2019s IPO slowdown was in line with Beijing\u2019s policy aims, according to Scarlett Liu, Apac equity and derivative strategist at BNP Paribas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a regulatory attempt to achieve balance between primary and secondary market,\u201d she said, adding that authorities were concerned that too many listings could drain activity from secondary market trading.\n\nHong Kong, China\u2019s offshore financial hub, saw a relative increase in equity raising activity to more than $10bn by December from $6bn in 2023, including some large transactions such as electronics maker Midea raising more than $4bn in a secondary listing.\n\nAnalysts say Hong Kong will continue to benefit as a listing venue for mainland Chinese companies to raise offshore capital.\n\n\u201cFor Chinese companies pursuing IPOs, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange remains a top venue offering a more streamlined listing process, market stability and transparency, and greater access to global capital,\u201d said Frank Bi, partner and Asian practice head of corporate transactions at law firm Ashurst.\n\nIndia, which had a large volume of relatively smaller deals in 2024, has been buoyed by companies seeking to raise funds while valuations remain sky-high, including by spinning off Indian units of multinational companies such as Hyundai.\n\n\u201cObviously the number of transactions has gone up but the average ticket size per transaction is down about 75-80 per cent in the last two years,\u201d said one Mumbai-based banker. \u201cNow, what that tells me is [companies are thinking] \u2018run for the hills, let\u2019s try to cash in as quickly as we can, whatever we can while market conditions remain supportive\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut as the world\u2019s most populous nation\u2019s rapid growth slows, with corporates reporting weak earnings and GDP growth falling sharply to 5.4 per cent in the third quarter \u2014 the lowest rate in almost two years \u2014 foreign portfolio managers have turned cautious on its frothy equity market.They pulled more than $11bn out of Indian stocks in October, a record monthly exodus, as well as a further $2.5bn in November.\n\nHowever, bankers think that the wider exuberance in primary and secondary listings in India is likely to be sustained into the new year. \u201cNot to comment on the quality of the offerings,\u201d a second banker in Mumbai said, \u201cthere is enough activity lined up so long as the markets are supportive and the liquidity is there.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair to say that the first two quarters of 2025 will see no change from where we are right now,\u201d he added.\n\nGlobal investment bankers too remain bullish on India, while warning that its relative growth may be eclipsed by a larger comeback in the US and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cGlobally we expect the IPO market activity to normalise in 2025 and we will see a pick-up in volumes especially in the US and Europe and possibly also out of China.

In the first 10 months of this year, Indian box office collections were $1bn, down 7 per cent from the same period last year. What\u2019s more,\u00a02024\u2019s big hits were all from the south of the country, with Pushpa 2: The Rule and Kalki 2898 AD running to packed houses.\n\nViewer time and wallet share are severely fractured. There are a dozen Indian video streaming services, a few international ones, as well as competition from YouTube, Instagram Reels and other user-generated content vying for eyeballs. Watching a film in a multiplex is not a cheap exercise; the tickets are pricey and the popcorn pricier (scroll down for the appropriate tax rates). A large chunk of the audience now prefers to wait for the movie to land in a streaming service than watch it in cinemas.\n\nAt the same time, the costs of movie making have only increased. Despite the astronomical price tags that come with Bollywood\u2019s A-listers, big names\u00a0are no longer guaranteed to draw in crowds. In October, director Karan Johar, who had managed to seize the zeitgeist for the past two decades, sold a 50 per cent share in his Dharma Productions to vaccine billionaire Adar Poonawalla. The press release announcing the merger was telling; it talked about the challenges of the digital future without saying how the company planned to navigate it \u2014 only that it would need the resources to do so.\n\nThere are no simple fixes. It\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to tear people away from their devices and into theatres \u2014 and the Hindi film industry is suffering a crisis of confidence. As budgets bloat, production houses are playing it safe by falling back on the same old formula and not taking any creative risks.\n\nAjay Bijli, the head of India\u2019s largest multiplex operator PVR Inox, told the FT that Bollywood\u2019s content makers were still \u201cgrappling with what the consumer wants\u201d. Cinemas\u00a0are instead counting on big Hollywood films to fill up seats next year, and who can blame them?

Sheikh Hasina has denied the allegations.\n\nThe diplomatic request will fuel tensions between New Delhi and Dhaka just weeks after India\u2019s foreign secretary visited Bangladesh to try to mend relations between the neighbours.\n\nA spokesperson for India\u2019s foreign ministry confirmed it had received a \u201cnote verbale from the Bangladesh High Commission today in connection with an extradition request\u201d, but declined to comment further.\n\nSheikh Hasina\u2019s dramatic toppling roused suspicion and concern in New Delhi, which has historically supported her Awami League, Bangladesh\u2019s oldest and biggest political party.\n\nRivals and rights groups have accused the Awami League of extrajudicial killings, bending state institutions to its whim and rigging elections. Many Indian officials believe the installation of Bangladesh\u2019s caretaker leader, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, was the result of a US-backed regime change.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has also raised concerns about the safety of minority Hindus in India\u2019s Muslim-majority neighbour. Yunus has acknowledged limited incidents of violence against Hindus, though human rights groups have not confirmed any mass atrocities.\n\nYunus told the Financial Times in October his government would not ask for Sheikh Hasina\u2019s extradition from its dominant south Asian neighbour until a verdict had been reached by the investigative tribunal, which last week extended the deadline for its probe into February.\n\nBut last month, Yunus called for her return following the arrest of dozens of former Bangladesh government officials and regime associates. In an address he said: \u201cWe will seek the extradition of the ousted autocrat from India.\u201d\n\nWhile Sheikh Hasina has not been seen in public since she left Bangladesh, she made a broadcast address earlier this month accusing Yunus, with whom she has long feuded, of being the \u201cmastermind\u201d behind the violence and her removal. The Awami League also claims his interim government has \u201cweaponised\u201d the country\u2019s institutions against them.\n\nSheikh Hasina denied she had ordered security forces to use lethal force against protesters and claimed the allegations against her were \u201cfalse propaganda\u201d and part of a \u201cconspiracy against us to push us out of power\u201d.\n\nHer son Sajeeb Wazed, who has also previously denied any wrongdoing by his mother, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA high court in Bangladesh earlier this month also ordered an investigation against Sheikh Hasina and her niece Tulip Siddiq, a UK Treasury minister, after their family was accused of embezzling $5bn. A UK government spokesperson has said Siddiq denies \u201cany involvement in the allegations\u201d.", "tag": "india?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1277b3bb-a299-47e1-8973-e68591e7d982"}, {"uuid4": "2607bc10-cedb-4a02-afd7-b24e2157d259", "title": "Indian cinema turns to high-octane movies to overcome box office \u2018famine\u2019", "description": "Action films from country\u2019s south have won audience favour while Bollywood has endured string of flops", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2024-12-22T05:00:45.275Z", "content": "India\u2019s entertainment industry is banking on a solid line-up of local and Hollywood releases to drag it out of a blockbuster \u201cfamine\u201d and get people back into cinemas after a series of flops.\n\nIndian box office takings have fallen 7 per cent to Rs89.5bn ($1bn) from January to October, compared with the same period in 2023, according to Ormax Media.\n\nBut the Mumbai-based consultancy expects the strong performance from sequels and franchises, including Hindi-language horror-comedy Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 and southern Indian macho thriller Pushpa 2: The Rule, to help reverse 2024\u2019s relatively muted performance.\n\nAjay Bijli, the head of India\u2019s largest multiplex operator PVR Inox, said the next financial year starting in April would see a \u201cfull slate\u201d of domestic and international offerings, including the latest Mission Impossible and Marvel movies.\n\nBut Mumbai-centred Bollywood has been wrestling with a string of recent Hindi-language flops as viewers kept away from movie theatres following the pandemic.\n\nAudiences have gravitated to high-testosterone action flicks from the country\u2019s south, particularly those produced by the Telugu-language industry known as Tollywood.\n\nBijli said that the industry\u2019s issues were to do with the \u201cconsistency of content connecting with the audiences\u201d. Studios and cinemas struggled with either \u201cfeast or famine\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe volatility, the peaks and troughs, have become very, very pronounced post Covid,\u201d Bijli said. \u201cContent makers are grappling with what the consumer wants.\u201d\n\nIn response to changing preferences, Bollywood has pushed out extravagant features that mirror some of the successful south Indian productions. Jawan, the highest grossing film of 2023 starring the country\u2019s biggest actor Shah Rukh Khan, was directed by south India\u2019s Arun Kumar, known professionally as Atlee.\n\nThis year, Jio Studios \u2014 the Indian film house owned by Asia\u2019s wealthiest person Mukesh Ambani \u2014 has had a run of hits, including Singham Again, the latest in a cop action series that heavily references the Ramayana, a Hindu epic. Jio\u2019s horror comedy Stree 2 had been one of the highest grossing Indian films of 2024.\n\nFollowing a series of titles for digital-only release, more Indian studios are focusing on theatrical releases.\n\n\u201cFor at least a couple of years, most of these [streaming] platforms were saddled with dead snakes around their neck and massively overpaid for content,\u201d said Jyoti Deshpande, Jio Studios chief and president of the media and content division at Ambani\u2019s conglomerate Reliance Industries.\n\n\u201cI think that correction has happened,\u201d she added. \u201cOne must produce carefully, produce for theatrical [release] unless commissioned in advance by some platform.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s box office revenue is now expected to expand at a 14 per cent compound annual growth rate to Rs237bn by 2028, according to a PwC report published this month.\n\nJio Studios is hoping to expand globally and is targeting deals with Hollywood. Deshpande said talks are on with US studios to collaborate more widely \u201con various tracks\u201d, including co-production, distribution and superstar crossovers \u2014 whether big US names in Indian productions, or vice versa.\n\n\u201cOur talent in their films, their talent in our films\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I think that\u2019s the next phase,\u201d Deshpande said about collaboration between Bollywood and Hollywood. \u201cWe haven\u2019t scratched the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nSo far only a few Indian megastars, such as Alia Bhatt, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Deepika Padukone, have acted in big-budget US features. Chopra Jonas has appeared in Hollywood flicks such as 2021\u2019s The Matrix Resurrections and the 2017 cinematic remake of Baywatch. Bhatt made her Hollywood debut in the 2023 spy thriller Heart of Stone, while Padukone starred in the 2017 Vin Diesel vehicle xXx: The Return Of Xander Cage.\n\nDeshpande predicted that India\u2019s fragmented entertainment industry would enter a period of consolidation.\n\nIn October, Indian vaccine billionaire Adar Poonawalla marked his first foray into the film business. He spent $199mn to buy a 50 per cent stake in Dharma Productions, the studio headed by Karan Johar, the powerful Bollywood director behind blockbusters including romantic comedy Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and family melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be survival of the fittest,\u201d Deshpande said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big boys\u2019 game.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ce4c131a-a849-41de-8c01-37bba950e1fc"}, {"uuid4": "fa698be4-870a-466a-807e-7b4187720f30", "title": "Across Rajasthan by rail \u2014 our family adventure", "description": "From bustling cities to encounters with big cats, a tour by train proves an eye-opening holiday for Kate Maxwell and her children", "author": "Kate Maxwell", "published_date": "2024-12-21T05:00:19.663Z", "content": "It was 5.30am, a week before Diwali, and a crescent moon hung horizontally above Jaipur railway station. It looked, my son said, \u201clike a smile\u201d. People in suits and bright saris rolled wheelie bags along the platform, stray dogs slept through the plinky departure announcements and the growl of locomotive engines. The air smelled of dust and chai.\n\nMy husband, our children, aged nine and eight, and I were here to board the fourth and final train of our tour of Rajasthan, the five-hour Jaipur to Jodhpur Express. Two weeks on the beach in Greece is our usual holiday speed, so travelling around India was a major step up. I\u2019d approached the trip with some trepidation, worried we\u2019d get ill \u2014 an Indian friend even suggested we take Imodium prophylactically \u2014 and that the multiple destinations and sensory overload would be too much for our kids; and to start with, it was.\n\nNegotiating Kolkata\u2019s steamy, marigold-strung Mullick Ghat flower market 10 days earlier, my daughter clutched my hand so hard I developed a bruise. But now, she and her younger brother strolled confidently ahead with their red and yellow backpacks.\n\nWe\u2019d come to India to visit Shuktara, a Kolkata-based charity my husband is involved with, and had decided to explore Rajasthan while we were here.\u00a0When I heard that Original Travel was launching a new tour of the region by rail, using the sorts of local trains millions of Indians take every day, I was keen to try it: I hoped it would \u200bi\u200bntroduce us to Rajasthani life in a way that criss-crossing the state in a hermetically sealed minibus might not.\n\nThe trip would take in the temples, palaces and forts of Rajasthan\u2019s Rajput and Mughal past, as well as exposing us to its rapidly changing present, with bespoke, family-friendly activities \u2014 including, we hoped, encounters with \u200ba\u200b couple of apex predators.\n\nAs well as booking our train seats (having read Monisha Rajesh\u2019s\u00a0Around India in 80 Trains,\u00a0I knew this was no mean feat) in air-conditioned carriages, and providing drivers and guides, the company\u2019s Delhi concierge would \u200balways\u00a0be on the end of a WhatsApp. If we were going to leave our sandcastle\u200b-building\u00a0comfort zone, this was the way to do it.\n\nThe rail journeys, it turned out, were high points of the holiday, not just for the hubbub of the stations and the views, but also because of the people we met. As the train left Jaipur and the sky turned a hazy pink, the city gave way to farmland dotted with haystacks that looked, we thought, like the straw houses from The Three Little Pigs.\n\nA samosa seller began his rounds and a couple across the aisle giggled through YouTube videos as the vast, milky Sambhar Salt Lake hove into sight. Later, I struck up conversation with a man on his way home for Diwali. \u201cMy brother likes crackers,\u201d he told me, when I asked him if he\u2019d be lighting fireworks. \u201cI prefer beer.\u201d\n\nOur train trip began in Delhi, where we stayed at the Imperial hotel, its marble and teak hallways decorated with photos of elephants leading processions, military regiments, and busts of King George V and Queen Mary. The next day, we swapped the hotel\u2019s jasmine-scented interiors for a rickshaw ride around the hectic streets of Old Delhi with our polymath guide, Robinson.\n\nSo much for food poisoning \u2014 the greatest health hazard of the holiday came in the form of a rampaging bull that spun around in front of us before collapsing from dizziness. Somehow, my husband and I managed not to convey our terror to the children, for whom the experience was a holiday highlight.\n\nThe following morning, we boarded the Gatiman Express for Agra, en route to the Taj Mahal. I found the sight of the white marble mausoleum at dawn, when it glowed like a pink pearl, spellbinding. But again, animals were the biggest draw for the junior members of the party, my son grabbing my phone to snap two Egyptian vultures perching on a minaret.\n\nOur next hotel also had royal connections. On the edge of the Aravalli hills, Six Senses Fort Barwara is an exquisite conversion of a 14th-century fort\u200b\u200b\u00a0built by the Chauhan Rajput clan. Ancient frescoes line the walls of the women\u2019s temple, now part of the spa, and though most of the building is new, including the swimming pool, with a raised platform on which my children lounged like mini maharajas, it melds elegantly with the original crenellations and domes.\n\nMost of our fellow guests here and at our other hotels were Indian tourists: the Covid pandemic, we were told repeatedly, persuaded prosperous Indians to discover their own backyards, just as it had for British holidaymakers in the UK.\n\nFort Barwara was our jumping-off point for Ranthambore National Park, an hour\u2019s drive west, where we went in search of tigers.\u00a0The closest my children had been to a safari was Whipsnade Zoo, and they were agog at the mongooses, sambar and spotted deer, and peacocks we saw on our afternoon drive.\n\nAn hour in, our 4x4 stopped, and\u00a0our guide Jyotirmoy Chaturvedi\u00a0pointed out tiger tracks\u200b. A series of \u200bloud\u00a0barks followed: warning calls from a sambar deer\u200b. We clung on as the vehicle shot off at high speed, pulses soaring. The tiger eluded us, but no one minded: being on a mission, binoculars clapped to our eyes, the rolling green-and-ochre landscape darkening as the light faded, was enough of a thrill.\n\nIn fact, our favourite part of the day came when we left the serene park in our open-top 4x4 and entered a maelstrom of daily life on the outskirts of Sawai Madhopur. Motorbikes hooted and swerved around marauding warthogs, goats and families of monkeys; children waved from balconies strung with neon Diwali lights as the smells of evening meals being cooked drifted by.\n\nFrom Sawai Madhopur, the closest station to Ranthambore, it was a two-hour train ride to Jaipur. That evening on our hotel\u2019s terrace: we were stunned to see over 100 kites swinging high above the Old City\u2019s rooftops, practice for Jaipur\u2019s\u00a0centuries-old kite festival.\n\nBuilt at the start of the 19th century,\u00a0Samode Haveli became a hotel in the 1980s\u200b,\u200b and members of the \u200baristocratic\u00a0Samode family still live there: \u200bs\u200btaff walk their dachshunds under a 200-year-old banyan tree\u200b.\u200b Jaipur\u2019s royal family still occupies its City Palace, too, as we saw first-hand: one minute we were admiring a photograph of 25-year-old Princess Gauravi Kumari, the next she was zooming past in a golf buggy.\n\nThe following day, we were driven \u200bto the village of Bagru, where the 400-year-old craft of block printing is going strong. We were shown bubbling vats of natural dyes and the pomegranate flowers used to fix the colours, before being invited to have a go. My daughter loved it, stamping her fabric \u200b\u200bso vigorously with the leaf blocks she\u2019d chosen that I was surprised we weren\u2019t printed head to toe by the time we left. Back at home, she used her new skill in a school art project, carving potatoes instead of wood.\n\nMy son is less interested in crafting but obsessed with cricket \u2014 no gender stereotypes here \u2014 and Original Travel had arranged for him to have a game with boys from Blue Heaven School, outside \u200bJaipur. While he picked up spin-bowling tips from Nardeep Rajawat, school director and former cricket pro, I chatted to his teenage teammates about their career plans. Most were would-be entrepreneurs; true Modi citizens, keen, they told me, to capitalise on India\u2019s raw materials and infrastructure.\u00a0India\u2019s GDP grew by about 7 per cent in 2024, a trajectory it was easy to imagine continuing as we chatted.\n\nBut as the economy has grown, wealth and income inequalities have widened, and we saw plenty of evidence of that during our trip, too. Before coming to India, my husband and I debated whether we should be exposing our children to the country\u2019s appalling poverty. \u201cIndia\u2019s got riches,\u201d my daughter observed, \u201cbut they\u2019re not shared out.\u201d If nothing else, I hope our trip made them realise how lucky they are with their cosy London lives, food in the fridge and drinkable water in the taps.\n\nAfter exploring Jodhpur\u2019s Mehrangarh fort, a feat of Rajput engineering that hovers 120 metres above the Thar desert and had the best arsenal of any fort we\u2019d visited \u2014 \u201cArms & Weapons\u201d signs, I\u2019d discovered, are catnip to eight- and nine-year-olds \u2014 we drove to three hours to our last stop. Suj\u00e1n Jawai is a spectacularly beautiful camp with just 10 tents, each with a terrace, bathtub and marble shower, in a wilderness area known for its leopards.\n\nLeopards are notoriously hard to spot, and after the tiger no-show we were prepared to be disappointed. Our intrepid zoologist-ranger, Siddarth Waradkar (\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, I was rescuing a 12-foot rock python,\u201d was his introduction), refused to be drawn on our chances either.\n\nBut within five minutes of leaving the camp, we found Baliraja, a dominant male leopard, beneath a tree. It was an emotional moment: we were so close we could see his chest rise and fall. \u201cHe winked at me,\u201d said my daughter.\u00a0That same afternoon, we watched a hefty eight-month-old cub stretch and yawn on a rock. Suj\u00e1n\u2019s rewilding efforts, which began a decade ago and included uprooting an invasive species of acacia, have helped increase the leopards\u2019 prey, and their population has risen by about 50 per cent.\n\nThe animals are now comfortable with humans \u2014 as long as they stay in their vehicles \u2014 hence our\u00a0\u200bup-close\u00a0sightings. The property has a community-focused approach to conservation: 90 per cent of the camp\u2019s staff, including its red-turbaned Rabari guards, come from local villages, and it sponsors 10 nearby schools.\n\nThe following morning, Sid received a call from one of the camp\u2019s spotters, and we sped towards Jawai dam (\u201cthis is literally like Mario Kart,\u201d said my son appreciatively as we rollercoastered over the granite rocks), where we found another cub, rolling on its back as if asking to be tickled. On our last dusk drive, cicadas chirping as loudly as alarm clocks, we were escorted back to Suj\u00e1n by a leopard that strolled six feet in front of our vehicle. \u201cHe\u2019s saying goodbye,\u201d said Sid.\n\nIn the end, it was the constant gearshifts I\u2019d worried about that made our tour of Rajasthan so magical. \u201cEverything\u2019s so different,\u201d said my children again and again: different from yesterday, and different from home. Hopping between cacophonous, kaleidoscopic cities and pristine wildernesses where big cats roamed hadn\u2019t just been electrifying, it had stretched our holiday horizons.\n\nAs\u00a0the kids stuck their train tickets in their journals and I put four unopened packets of Imodium in the bathroom cupboard, I\u00a0\u200bwondered if\u00a0we\u2019d ever be content with two weeks on the beach again.\n\nKate Maxwell is the author of \u2018Hush\u2019 (Virago)\n\nNote: this article has been corrected. The original version wrongly said that Mehrangarh fort in Jodhpur was a feat of Mughal rather than Rajput engineering.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life & Art wherever you listen", "tag": "india?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c06c9303-3841-401f-9d3d-4bd0b8994654"}, {"uuid4": "c3a493e4-4cbf-488e-9321-b3388aa863b7", "title": "Crooked road to the C-suite", "description": "Also in this newsletter: Starlink\u2019s woes in India, and R Ashwin\u2019s brilliant career", "author": "Veena Venugopal", "published_date": "2024-12-20T01:30:28.952Z", "content": "Good morning. Even as Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink awaits government clearances to operate in India, its devices seem to be popping up in various parts of the country. In other news, a mostly unproductive winter session of parliament ends today; the only notable event is that the \u201cone nation, one election\u201d bill will be moved to a joint parliamentary committee. But first, one in three senior executives lie on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s!\n\nEven those at the very top lie in their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. KPMG carried out a million background checks on job applicants in India over a year and found that 30 per cent of senior management and C-suite candidates had misrepresented themselves during the recruitment process. As a group, executives had a discrepancy rate comparable to applicants in real estate and infrastructure \u2014 the industry with the highest share of errant candidates (31 per cent). The average across different industries was 11 per cent.\n\nThis is not good news for companies. At the senior executive level, they found candidates misstating the actual reason for leaving a job, not mentioning legal disputes, as well as interpersonnel issues around how senior managers were treating their staff members.\n\nVideo interviews, that enduring post-pandemic legacy, also make it hard to assess candidates, especially on softer issues such as alignment with the company\u2019s culture and values. But technology is catching up, with digital tools that help detect interview impersonation (!) and document tampering. For senior managers, companies also conduct extensive background checks, gathering \u201chuman intelligence\u201d to ensure the candidate is the right fit for the job.\n\nJob hunt experts and interview coaches emphasise the importance of crafting your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for the job description. But that only means highlighting the roles and accomplishments that are most relevant for the job, not adding falsehoods. Hiring is an expensive process for corporations and rectifying wrong decisions even more so. Consequently, the use of sophisticated tools (now backed by AI) will only grow. Taking creative liberties with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s will be counter-productive.\n\nDo you have a story about fantastical r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or hilarious interviews?

Just this week, the billionaire rejected claims that the satellite communication devices were used in strife-torn Manipur, the second time in a fortnight that Starlink has been accused of facilitating\u00a0criminal activity in the country. Earlier this month, officials in the Andaman and Nicobar administration had sent a legal demand to the company\u2019s headquarters, seeking the name of the customer of the device used by smugglers who were caught in the island with $4.2bn worth of methamphetamine, according to news reports. Musk took to X to clarify that Starlink\u2019s satellite beams were turned off in India and that its use would not have been possible.\n\nThese accusations aside, the company, which registered its India operations in 2021, has long been seeking approvals from the Indian government to start its service. Currently, only Jio Satellite communications and Bharti-group backed OneWeb have licences. Security clearances are, rightly, a long and difficult process and it has been an especially fraught wait for Starlink. However, in October, the company got a boost when the government said it would not be auctioning spectrum for satellite broadband and instead would award it administratively. Jio\u2019s Mukesh Ambani and Airtel\u2019s Mittal were pushing for an auction. The whispers in New Delhi\u2019s corridors suggest that Musk will get a licence sooner rather than later. But this is a fight among giants \u2014 it\u2019s premature to predict anything.

India\u2019s stock market regulator would like to bring the benefits of algorithmic trading to all investors \u2014 it is currently restricted to foreign funds and proprietary traders. I\u2019m also keeping an eye on parliament, where there\u2019s talk that the One Nation One Election bill could be introduced this week. We\u2019ll know more today. Plus, the cost of India\u2019s huge spam call problem.\n\nLast Friday, after holding out for years, India\u2019s stock market regulator, Sebi, signalled that it was likely to open algorithmic trading to retail investors. In September, the board published a study that showed that algo trading was responsible for 97 and 96 per cent of the profits in the futures and options segment of foreign investors and proprietary traders respectively.\n\nSebi\u2019s draft guidelines are tight: each algorithm will have to be approved by the stock exchanges, and all orders will be tagged by unique identifiers so they can be traced and audited accurately. Even individual \u201ctech-savvy\u201d investors will be able to approach the exchanges through their brokers to register their algos. Sebi has split algos into two categories: white box, whose logic and rules are public, and black box algos, which are closed to external scrutiny. The regulator has codified specific rules for each, and mandated that stock exchanges have access to a kill switch in order to ensure that rogue algos don\u2019t result in price manipulations in the market.\n\nThe regulator is right to temper enthusiasm with caution in opening algo trading to all investors. The past few years have witnessed tremendous participation by retail investors \u2014 many of whom are young and technologically knowledgeable \u2014 in the stock markets, and it would be unfair to deprive them of the opportunities that large fund houses can enjoy. At the same time, the fast-paced nature of these transactions leaves investors vulnerable to big losses, especially in the futures and options segment. Additionally, there is the ever-looming shadow of fraud (which is inadvertently turning out to be the word of the day in today\u2019s newsletter) and it is the board\u2019s responsibility to protect investors from unscrupulous operators running dubious algorithms.\n\nInitial responses to these rules have criticised their tedious nature. Registering each algorithm with the stock exchange will most certainly be a time-consuming process. White box algos will be prone to easy duplication and institutional investors continue to have an edge because these restrictions do not apply to them. But Sebi is probably investing in the wisdom of taking baby steps. I don\u2019t blame them.\n\nThe draft guidelines are open for public comments until January 3. If you have any ideas or suggestions, head over to Sebi\u2019s website and record them.\n\nDo you think Sebi\u2019s rules are good for retail investors? Let me know at indiabrief@ft.com\n\nOver the past seven days, I received four spam calls on average each day. This is nearly three months after my mobile service provider, Airtel, launched its sophisticated AI-powered spam call filtering system. Last week, Airtel said the filter had flagged 8bn calls and 800mn messages in the 10 weeks since it was rolled out. That\u2019s a million spammers every day, which accounted for 6 per cent of all calls, the company said.\n\nThese numbers are staggering. Spam calls are not just a nuisance (anyone who has tried to take a nap on a weekend afternoon will use a stronger word than that), they are also the feeder system for cyber fraud. Indians lost Rs113.3bn to such frauds in the first nine months of this year, according to data reported from the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre. Stock trading and other investment scams constituted the largest chunk of this, accounting for more than 325,000 complaints filed. \u201cDigital arrests\u201d \u2014 a scam where uniformed (fake) law enforcement officials appear on video calls to extort victims \u2014 accounted for the second-highest share, with more than 63,000 people losing Rs16.16bn. They have become so prevalent that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi cautioned people against them in his radio programme. In most of these cases, the scamsters approached their victims through spam calls or messages.\n\nIn an interconnected world, it is not easy to wipe out cyber fraud. But it is puzzling why this is not a priority for the government and the telecom regulatory authority. There is, understandably, a high degree of suspicion about data security in India, and a leak-proof Do Not Disturb (DND) registry is step one in building trust in the system.

It\u2019s Friday the 13th, but I\u2019m feeling lucky to have received all of your feedback and suggestions after Tuesday\u2019s inaugural newsletter. Thank you for the messages, and please keep them coming.\n\nFor today: should India Inc look beyond the balance sheet and contribute to nation building? Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman urges companies to blend commercial considerations with the nation\u2019s priorities. I am also keeping an eye on the winter session of parliament, where chaos continues with the BJP and opposition parties butting heads on the political situation in Manipur, as well as the role of American billionaire George Soros in \u201cdestabilising India\u201d. Plus, how will Adani Group pay its big bills?\n\nIn a familiar admonishment, the finance minister told Indian CEOs this week that their commercial considerations should blend with the nation\u2019s priorities and strategic needs.\n\nWhile she elaborated on the requirement for large corporates to work with small and medium enterprises and focus on job creation, her primary bugbear is capital expenditure. In public and private, Sitharaman has expressed her frustration that Indian companies are not investing enough, and that the responsibility for capital expenditure is overwhelmingly carried by the government (although this has recently slowed; official figures showed that government capex grew only 5.4 per cent in the second quarter, a further drop from 7.5 per cent in the previous quarter).\n\nCorporations are not going to be let off easily. According to several news reports, the government has asked the National Statistical Office to conduct a survey of private capex, the results of which will be published in March. With high inflation and low GDP growth, the Indian economy is in a tight corner and the government needs all the help it can get. But shaming corporations into increasing their capital expenditure is not a sustainable way to grow the economy. It is the government\u2019s responsibility to ensure that conditions are favourable enough for private capital to be deployed.\n\nThe government wants India Inc to step up on the demand side, too. Last week, chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran urged companies to hire more and pay better. Listed companies are making higher profits while their wage costs are shrinking. It\u2019s self-destructive that there isn\u2019t adequate demand in the economy for the companies\u2019 own products to be bought, he pointed out.\n\nCorporate pay scales are determined by market forces and the low wage scale is a reflection of high unemployment. Even if they are responsible citizens, CEOs are paid to focus on their balance sheets and it is inevitable that if they can reduce wage costs, they will. You can either be a capitalist or socialist; it is difficult to be both.\n\nDo you think companies have a responsibility to the nation and not just their shareholders? Write to us at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply.\n\nThis week Adani Group said it would no longer tap $500mn in US development financing for the port the conglomerate is building in Sri Lanka, and will instead use internal accruals and its capital management plan to fund the construction. Adani had secured support for the project from the US International Development Finance Corporation in November 2023, after the short seller Hindenburg Research published its report accusing the company of manipulating its stock price. A US federal agency\u2019s backing\u00a0was seen as a ringing endorsement of the company and its business practices.\n\nA year later, Adani is in even bigger trouble after US prosecutors announced their decision to indict Gautam Adani and seven others. The big question now: how is Adani Group going to raise money? It has significant debts to service, with $1.7bn reportedly due in March, as well as high working capital requirements.\n\nLast month, after the news of the indictment broke, the company abandoned its $600mn bond offering for Adani Green Energy and reassured investors that the group\u2019s companies have enough cash to service their debts for the next 12 months. Infrastructure projects are expensive businesses to fund and even if the group has enough internal accruals to continue the port project and service its debts until March, it will have to find ways to raise funds soon.

Adani\u2019s conglomerate has rejected the charges, with the billionaire telling an audience last month that \u201cevery attack makes us stronger\u201d.\n\nReNew is planning to offer $7.07 a share, compared with Tuesday\u2019s closing price of $6.34, in a buyout deal with a consortium of companies, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated December 10.\n\nThe consortium includes Masdar, the state-owned UAE renewable energy company, and other strategic investors such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, one of the world\u2019s biggest pension funds, and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. ReNew declined to comment.\n\n\u201cThere is a high probability the consortium will be able to buy out the other shareholders and take ReNew private, although they might have to make a better offer,\u201d Bernstein India analysts wrote in a note. \u201cSubsequent to that it won\u2019t be surprising to us to see the stock listed back in India with a capital raise to help ReNew realise its full potential.\u201d\n\nSumant Sinha, a former investment banker and chief executive of ReNew, told the Financial Times this year that markets were undervaluing renewable energy companies and hampering the green transition.\n\nHe added that ReNew was considering moving its listing from the Nasdaq over the prospect of Donald Trump\u2019s re-election hitting clean energy stocks.\n\nIn August, ReNew signed a supply contract to provide Microsoft in India with nearly 440MW of green electricity.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge is the US listing itself,\u201d said a Mumbai-based energy analyst, who added that the \u201clow liquidity\u201d company makes it a relative minnow for US investors. \u201cThe target market for the stock is very small.\u201d\n\nThe analyst added that ReNew\u2019s \u201chigh\u201d debt levels and costs had put pressure on profitability. \u201cYou cannot have a lot of overheads,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a low-returns business.\u201d\n\nIn a research note in September, analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded ReNew to \u201cequal weight\u201d, saying that while the company was likely to report strong earnings growth, its revenues would be volatile because of its large wind portfolio and that it had significant levels of debt.", "tag": "india?page=2", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/68a10e10-b241-4089-923c-0f01d41e3245"}, {"uuid4": "79019e8f-729d-4d55-bd6d-35549ad54031", "title": "Adani drops US financing for strategic Sri Lanka port", "description": "Conglomerate pulls out of $500mn loan deal as it wrestles with bribery allegations", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2024-12-11T05:24:20.012Z", "content": "Gautam Adani\u2019s conglomerate has said it will no longer tap $500mn in US development financing for a Sri Lankan port project after the group\u2019s billionaire chair was accused of orchestrating a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme.\n\nBacking from the US International Development Finance Corporation for the project was announced in November 2023, months after Adani Group had been accused of \u201cbrazen\u201d corporate fraud and stock price manipulation by short seller Hindenburg Research.\n\nAt the time, the conglomerate described the funding for the Colombo West International Terminal, the DFC\u2019s largest infrastructure investment in Asia, as \u201ca ringing endorsement\u201d of the company. Karan Adani, the billionaire\u2019s son who heads the ports business, said the loan was \u201ca reaffirmation by the international community of our vision, our capabilities and our governance\u201d.\n\nBut the conglomerate has pulled out of the loan deal as it wrestles with allegations of bribery brought by the US in November. The terminal \u201cwill be financed through the company\u2019s internal accruals and capital management plan\u201d, Adani Group\u2019s ports business said in a statement released late on Tuesday. \u201cWe have withdrawn our request for financing from the DFC.\u201d\n\nThe withdrawal shows how the Indian conglomerate may be hit by funding constraints in the wake of criminal and civil charges. The company has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and Gautam Adani said last month that \u201cevery attack makes us stronger\u201d.\n\nThe DFC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month, the development financing agency said it had yet to disburse the $553mn loan and was still conducting due diligence.\n\nThe loan for the Adani port in Sri Lanka was part of a broader US push to counter China\u2019s expanding influence in south Asia. Officials in Washington have publicly criticised Beijing\u2019s funding of infrastructure projects in various countries for being debt traps. In a visit to Sri Lanka in 2020, Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state Mike Pompeo called China a \u201cpredator\u201d.\n\nAdani, who has been accused by Indian opposition politicians of enjoying favoured treatment from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has previously criticised China and insisted the investments were designed to meet Sri Lanka\u2019s needs.\n\nThe Colombo terminal project, which was due to be operational this month, \u201cis progressing well and is on track for commissioning by early next year\u201d, Adani Ports said.\n\nStill, Adani Group\u2019s investments in Sri Lankan ports and green energy projects during the country\u2019s debt crisis have been criticised by local politicians, who have argued that the deals lack transparency.\n\nThe government of Sri Lanka\u2019s new leftist president Anura Kumara Dissanayake has opened investigations into Adani\u2019s projects across the island nation.\n\nThe group\u2019s overseas business interests are also coming under scrutiny in other countries. Kenya\u2019s President William Ruto cancelled $2.6bn in proposed deals after the US charges were brought against Adani and his associates.

My name is Veena Venugopal, and I\u2019m delighted to bring you news and insights from the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy every Tuesday and Friday. A bit about myself:\u00a0I started my career looking after European mergers and acquisitions for an IT company, before shifting gears and moving into journalism. In the two decades since, I\u2019ve covered everything from the Ambani brothers\u2019 feud to Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter, and also written three non-fiction books.\n\nAs you will know, in India news is often noisy and distracting and it\u2019s difficult to keep up with everything. I\u2019ll use my years of experience to sift through the headlines and dive deep into the stories that really matter to make sure you are ahead of the curve. I\u2019d also love your feedback, so please write to me at indiabrief@ft.com, or just hit \u201cReply\u201d.\n\nOn to today\u2019s agenda. The government announced yesterday that Shaktikanta Das, whom local media had expected to stay on as Reserve Bank of India governor, will be replaced this week \u2014 more on this below. I\u2019ll also be keeping an eye on protesting farmers, who have paused their \u201cDelhi Chalo\u201d (Let\u2019s go to Delhi) march and are deciding on the next course of action. Plus, is the sheen wearing off the CFA certification? But first: five companies are set to float this week, including fintech MobiKwik tomorrow and Blackstone-backed International Gemological Institute on Friday; we take stock of the surge in India\u2019s initial public offerings.\n\nIPO fever has seized India all year. According to S&P Global, 298 companies have gone public this year and raised Rs1.4tn ($16.6bn) in total, a 140 per cent increase from last year. Riding on this euphoria, predictions for IPOs in 2025 are off the charts. The Indian unit of consumer electronics group, LG, is planning a big offering in 2025, following in the footsteps of Hyundai, the other South Korean major that listed its Indian subsidiary this year. News reports suggest even Walmart-majority owned Flipkart is headed to the primary market next year. Each new interview with investment bankers seems to yield larger numbers of both volume and value of deals.\n\nBut colour me sceptical. Audacious optimism and animal spirits are one thing, but ground reality is quite another. Global markets are entering the new year with a whole bunch of uncertainties \u2014 the security situation in the Middle East is volatile, in Europe governments are falling like ninepins, and going by everything announced so far, Donald Trump\u2019s presidency will keep everyone\u2019s nerves on edge. Volatile markets aren\u2019t the best IPO vessels, as we have seen during and in the aftermath of Covid. Even in the buoyant markets we witnessed this year, IPOs haven\u2019t had a very smooth run. Hyundai, which was the largest offering, closed its first day in the bourses 5.73 per cent down, and the stock is still trading below its listing price. MobiKwik, which floats tomorrow, has had to cut down its issue size three times since it first started planning an IPO in 2021. The debacle that was Paytm\u2019s listing is still fresh on everyone\u2019s mind and unlike in the pre-Covid era, investors are quicker to punish companies that value themselves too highly.\n\nIt is in the interest of investment bankers to be optimistic about the IPO market, but I\u2019ll be taking their projections for 2025 with a bagful of salt. If markets hold, it is likely that we will see a handful of big listings and a bunch of smaller ones. But liquidity and macroeconomic concerns will keep all exuberance in check. Companies and their bankers will have to get the timing and the valuation absolutely right. Even Bollywood cannot count on guaranteed blockbusters these days, much less capital markets.\n\nDo you think 2025 will be a record year for IPOs? Write to me at indiabrief@ft.com.\n\nIt\u2019s December, which means it\u2019s the season for Spotify Wrapped. The music streaming platform published some mind-boggling stats about what users loved around the world.\n\nA chartered financial analyst certification once granted easy entry to top investment houses, attracting high numbers of candidates hoping to get jobs in the US and Europe. But the qualification is now struggling to find takers. There were 163,000 exam registrations last year, down 40 per cent from the peak of 270,456 in 2019.\u00a0In particular, the number of Chinese students taking the exam has fallen as the country\u2019s economic downturn affected demand.\n\nSo should Indian finance aspirants be eager to take the exam? The CFA Institute expects India to be the fastest-rising market for investment professionals, growing 33 per cent in the next decade. But don\u2019t bring out the party hats yet. The Indian education system, which tends to create technically qualified but not very well-rounded individuals, plays spoilsport here too. The report makes a cautionary note that many Indian candidates who have completed all levels of the CFA exams fall short of industry requirements because they lack soft skills. The other threat is posed by technology. As machine learning and artificial intelligence advances, many of the quantitative aspects of financial analysis can be run without human expertise. The CFA Institute is racing to stay relevant in the light of these structural changes, and it is not optimistic about \u201chyper growth\u201d in the future. It does have some words of advice: If you are young and just starting out, make yourself technologically savvy, and for those in middle management, be better communicators and leaders. If you are a successful top analyst, you don\u2019t need their advice \u2014 you have it all figured out!\n\n\u2014 Uday Kotak, founder and director, Kotak Mahindra Bank\n\nEach week, we invite a top Indian business leader to tell us their mantra for work and life.

Some groups have gained notoriety for headline-grabbing stunts, from throwing soup at works of art to breaking bank office windows.\n\nThe restrictions on protest and longer jail times across the world have sparked fears among academics and civil rights organisations of far-reaching consequences that could limit not just climate activists but the ability of any citizen to protest against any government, business or policy in the future.\n\nThe UN\u2019s rapporteur for environmental defenders Michel Forst told the Financial Times: \u201cDisproportionate sanctions for protests\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009have a significant adverse impact on the most fundamental freedoms.\n\n\u201cNot only of those who are personally criminalised for protesting, but also on every person concerned who would like to take part in protests but is deterred from doing so, by fear of being fined, tried, arrested or imprisoned for that.\u201d\n\nThe appellants argue that their \u201cconscientious motivation\u201d should have been taken into account during sentencing under both common and European human rights laws, while also questioning whether throwing soup at glass is an act of violence.\n\nThe UK has been at the forefront of attempts to curb protesters, according to academics, activists and non-profits. Until the emergence of activist group XR in 2018 and later JSO and Insulate Britain, which campaigns for greater energy efficiency, the country had little history of jailing non-violent climate protesters.\n\nOscar Berglund, a lecturer at Bristol university and specialist on climate activism, said protesters had been \u201ctargeted because they are effective to some extent\u201d.\n\nThe initial \u201cgreat wave\u201d of climate protests in 2019, with the emergence of XR and Fridays for Future, played a strong role in raising political and public awareness of climate change, said Andrew Firmin of Civicus, a non-profit group focused on strengthening citizen action.\n\nThe UK target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 was at least partially influenced by the climate protest movement, he said.\n\nBut critics say the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act of 2022 and the Public Order Act of 2023 have made it increasingly difficult to hold non-violent but disruptive protests, while also allowing for longer sentences.\n\nA report led by Lord Walney, commissioned by the previous government, called for a ban on extremist protest groups, arguing the \u201cbattle against climate change [has] been hijacked\u201d by those \u201cdetermined to bypass democratic norms and cause maximum disruption to society\u201d.\n\nThe Labour government declined to comment. Before being elected, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he backed stiff sentences for climate protesters who blocked roads.\n\nAmong those appealing against their sentences this week are 78-year-old grandmother and retired teacher Gaie Delap. Last year, she was jailed for 20 months for climbing on to gantries over the M25, but later released early. Before Christmas she was recalled to prison after no electronic tag \u2014 a condition of her early release \u2014 was available to fit her wrist.\n\nPhoebe Plummer, 23, who threw soup at the glass covering Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cSunflowers\u201d, is also appealing against her two-year sentence.\n\nIn other cases, protesters have been jailed without being found guilty of their alleged crimes. This includes 39-year-old Amy Pritchard.\n\nDuring her trial for public nuisance for blocking traffic, the presiding judge banned the defendants from mentioning climate change \u2014 Pritchard defied the order, intending to explain to the jury what had motivated her actions.\n\nWhile jurors failed to reach a verdict, the judge, Silas Reid, sentenced her to seven weeks in jail for contempt of court.\n\n\u201cThere are people who say that what he did was completely\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009justified, to separate the law and motivations,\u201d said Pritchard, but she felt the ban was \u201coutrageous\u201d. \u201cFor my understanding of the legal process, you go there to explain why you did what you did.\u201d\n\nPritchard received another jail sentence for criminal damage last year for cracking a window at a JPMorgan office.\n\nA report from Climate Rights International, a non-profit, in September also warned of heavy-handed treatment of climate protesters in Australia, the US, Germany, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing this [crackdown] in global north countries that have positioned themselves internationally as climate leaders,\u201d said Firmin. \u201cGovernments have closed down the space for protest.\u201d\n\nBut other senior figures said there was a balance to be struck. \u201cThere is a very wide envelope within which people can protest legitimately and lawfully,\u201d said Sir Robert Buckland, former lord chancellor and Conservative justice secretary.\n\n\u201cThe interests of freedom of speech are very important, but so are the rights and freedoms of other people who find their lives are disrupted.\u201d\n\nWhile officials argue that the crackdown is needed to deter protesters, it is also making some activists more resolute, said Linda Lakhdhir, legal director at Climate Rights International.\n\n\u201cMany protesters are going to worry more, think twice\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. [but] some people will think: \u2018If I have to go to jail, I will go to jail.

The US is the world\u2019s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cMovements actually work better when they\u2019re pushing back against a common enemy,\u201d she added.\n\nFisher said that historically social protest movements either \u201cpeter out and give up\u201d, often as their cause becomes less of an issue, or they \u201cradicalise until they achieve their goals\u201d, as was seen with the suffragettes and the civil rights movement.\n\nJust Stop Oil said the group expected more people to take to the streets as the effects of climate change became more apparent, and that Labour was not doing enough to tackle climate change.\n\n\u201cAs the consequences play out, as farming collapses, as millions are flooded and social order breaks down, as the risk of ruin becomes apparent the number of those prepared to act to defend our traditions, heritage and hard won rights will increase,\u201d the group said.\n\nMore than 1,000 people are expected to occupy the Strand outside the Royal Courts of Justice, where the appeal is being heard on Thursday lunchtime.\u00a0Television personalities Chris Packham and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and singer-songwriter Billy Bragg are among those due to attend.\n\nAhead of the appeal, XR spokesperson Zoe Cohen said: \u201cIt is shameful that the new government has not yet repealed these laws and restored the right of ordinary people to effective protest.

The previous plug-in car grant scheme, which paid out \u00a35,000 for an EV, was reduced over time and eventually scrapped in 2022 by the Conservative government.\n\nThe potential intervention on EVs comes after Labour chancellor Rachel Reeves weighed into a Supreme Court case to prevent the motor finance sector having to pay out billions in compensation to consumers.\n\nThe rise of pay-monthly deals for car purchases has transformed the country\u2019s auto finance sector. The most popular finance deal is called a \u201cpersonal contract purchase\u201d, which is a pay-monthly scheme that sees motorists finance the value a vehicle loses over three years rather than the total cost of the car.\n\nThe collapse in used prices for electric vehicles in the past two years means that EV repayments are typically higher than for petrol cars.\n\nAdrian Dally, FLA\u2019s motor finance director, said zero-interest loans would not fully equalise the cost between EVs and internal combustion vehicles, but he added: \u201cIf there was a way where the government could underwrite cheaper loans\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that would be extremely helpful.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the scheme on the public finances will depend on how the UK decides to structure any support.\u00a0Ministers hope that a change in the government\u2019s debt target to a new measure called \u201cpublic sector net financial liabilities\u201d \u2014 that counts more assets alongside public liabilities \u2014 could help the proposal.\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson declined to comment on the Financial Times report, but said 2024 was a \u201crecord year for switching to electric\u201d with 382,000 EVs sold and nearly 20,000 public chargers added to the network.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re investing over \u00a32.3bn to support industry and consumers make the switch.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6381ffbe-3d4b-4fdb-9a56-cf929b58cbfd"}, {"uuid4": "c89efff3-163d-41b0-a207-499a69e68c0f", "title": "UK hopes of security deal with EU hit by fishing dispute", "description": "Member states\u2019 demand for a youth mobility scheme also bogging down \u2018reset\u2019 talks", "author": "Henry Foy", "published_date": "2025-01-29T05:00:47.888Z", "content": "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s plan to agree a security pact with the EU is being blocked by French and other member states\u2019 demands over fishing rights and a youth mobility scheme, complicating hopes of an early win in \u201creset\u201d talks with Brussels.\n\nIn recent weeks, UK efforts to sign a bilateral security and defence partnership with the European Commission have met growing opposition from EU capitals that want to link it to a broader package of agreements, officials from both sides said.\n\nA senior UK government official said: \u201cOver the last four or five weeks it has become clear that it won\u2019t happen without early assurances on fish and mobility.

But a positive signal for what?\u201d\n\nUK ambitions have until recently been limited to signing a veterinary agreement to reduce border red tape for animal and plant products, a deal for recognising professional qualifications and an accord to make it easier for touring artists to play in the EU.\n\nHowever, Britain has recently signalled it may go further, within its red lines, by looking to re-link the UK and EU\u2019s carbon markets and being open to joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention, a customs agreement between the EU and 20 countries.\n\nThe EU has made clear that a youth mobility agreement to allow for 18 to 30-year-olds to study and work in the UK \u2014 which Brussels is calling a youth experience scheme \u2014 is vital to any wider reset with the UK.\n\nStarmer has repeatedly ruled out such a deal, saying it would contradict Labour\u2019s election manifesto promise not to return to free movement of people that Brexit ended, but some UK ministers are privately confident a \u201clanding zone\u201d will be found.\n\nThe UK Cabinet Office said it would not provide a running commentary on reset talks, while noting the EU and Britain\u00a0faced a common set of security challenges.\n\n\u201cAs part of resetting our relationship with our European neighbours we\u00a0continue to\u00a0work towards strengthening co-operation on areas of mutual\u00a0benefit, such as on security,\u201d a spokesperson added.\n\nA French official said the position of Paris had long been that after Brexit the UK could not \u201ccherry pick\u201d parts of EU policy or regulation, and added that this stance was widely shared among member states.\n\n\u201cSecurity and defence cannot be separated from the rest,\u201d said the official, citing migration, energy, mobility and fishing as issues that also needed resolution before any security pact with the UK.\n\nOlof Gill, a European Commission spokesman, said: \u201cWe look forward to the UK defining its priorities, including on defence and security, and will engage on that basis.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Leila Abboud", "tag": "world-uk?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3fb38bd6-c1a3-4ba7-80d7-290d4bea06fb"}, {"uuid4": "0bde0f25-6913-46dd-ae8b-615c56f25625", "title": "Can Rachel Reeves boost the UK\u2019s weak economic growth?

Output is likely to undershoot the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s outlook for 2025 as well, with the IMF predicting an expansion of 1.6 per cent in its latest outlook.\n\nOne of the factors dragging on growth was the UK\u2019s \u201cvery poor international trade performance\u201d, said Andrew Wishart, economist at Berenberg, with total exports falling while they held steady in other major economies. The UK\u2019s high production costs weighed on the export sector, he added, as companies face some of the highest electricity costs in the developed world alongside unusually big increases in labour costs.\n\nAt the same time, the leading services sector stopped contributing to overall growth. Services lifted growth at the start of 2024, with an expansion of 0.9 per cent in the first quarter, but registered no growth in the three months to September and the three months to November, the latest available data.\n\nAlan Taylor, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, has warned of \u201cebbing confidence\u201d due to a \u201ccash flow squeeze\u201d being felt by both businesses and households, in the form of tax hikes and continued high mortgage costs.\n\nBusiness groups say that elements of Labour\u2019s Budget in October made this uninspiring picture worse.\n\nReeves\u2019 decision to raise \u00a325bn via an increase in employer national insurance contributions, coupled with a sharp increase in the national living wage, has added to employment costs and dragged sharply on business sentiment.\n\nThere are increasing signs that businesses will shed staff as they attempt to keep costs under control. The S&P Global flash purchasing managers\u2019 survey last Friday showed the net share of businesses reducing staff numbers in January and December was the highest since the global financial crisis in 2009, apart from the start of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nSushil Wadhwani, a former Bank of England rate-setter, said Reeves had \u201clost the growth narrative\u201d partly as a result of the tax hike on businesses, adding that the decision had also muddied the labour market outlook for the BoE as it weighs how rapidly to cut interest rates.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot about animal spirits, and she damaged animal spirits,\u201d said Wadhwani.\n\nAll this comes in the context of a weak longer-term picture in the UK, in particular moribund productivity. Output per hour worked for April to June 2024 decreased by 0.9 per cent compared with the same quarter a year ago, according to the ONS.\n\nCompared with Q4 2019, before the pandemic, output per hour worked rose only by 0.8 per cent, according to the latest figures, well below the 2 per cent previously estimated. This is particularly weak compared with the US, where labour productivity rose by 8.3 per cent over the same period, buoyed by factors including strong corporate investment and a booming tech sector.\n\nBusiness investment has been lacklustre, particularly during a long period of stagnation following the Brexit referendum in 2016.\n\nIn the three months to September 2024, business investment was up 5.7 per cent compared with the same period the previous year, according to official data.\u00a0But it was up by the same amount in the eight years since early 2016, reflecting the lack of growth after the vote to leave the EU and the contraction during the pandemic.\n\nThis is a much weaker rate than in the US, where private non-residential fixed investment has risen by 40 per cent since 2016. And in the eight years before the Brexit referendum, UK business investment rose by about 26 per cent.\n\nReeves has been pledging radical changes to the UK\u2019s planning system to unlock more infrastructure projects and housebuilding, as well as reforms to better tap into pension savings.\n\nShe has been signalling her support for a third runway at Heathrow airport to boost connectivity, alongside support for a so-called\u00a0Oxford-Cambridge Arc that would bolster output in the science-rich region.\n\nAn industrial strategy focusing on key sectors including advanced manufacturing, creative industries such as film and TV, and financial services will follow in the spring.\n\nWith Donald Trump vowing to slash regulation in the US, the UK government has also been promising business it will hack away at red tape, including easing constraints on mortgage lending and a change of leadership at the competition regulator.\n\nA new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority has been announced to get to grips with endemic project delays.\n\nJim O\u2019Neill, a former Treasury minister and Goldman Sachs economist, said it was critical for the chancellor to convince the private sector that the UK\u2019s trend rate of growth can be lifted, and that meant explaining the value of her strategy to boost investment.\n\nThe poor growth rate reflects weak investment and productivity, said O\u2019Neill. \u201cHer framework in principle is designed to deal with that but they have to be serious about it and make sure anyone who will be a co-investor believes it.\u201d\n\nWadhwani said he doubted the short-term picture would improve unless Reeves \u201cbreaks the expectation\u201d that taxes will have to go up again given the weak state of the public finances.\n\nProgress in lowering barriers to trade with the EU, the UK\u2019s biggest market, would deliver a positive jolt to sentiment, he added.\n\nMichael Saunders, of Oxford Economics, said many of Reeves\u2019 policies on public and private investment made sense, but did not go far enough. The government needed to focus on bolstering investment in intangible assets, not just physical ones, he said.\n\nAnd it was likely to run up against shortages of construction workers given the breadth of its infrastructure and housing ambitions, he added, which meant devising a convincing labour force development plan.\n\n\u201cA broader strategy for potential growth is needed,\u201d he said.

Both programmes are widely credited with a significant increase in the number of students taking A-level maths.\n\nEntries for maths A-level in England have risen from 64,500 in 2009 to more than 98,000 in 2024, while the number of students taking further maths increased from 9,400 to almost 17,000 over the same period.\n\nThe AMSP also drove an uptake in the core maths programme, which is offered alongside A-levels\n\nSince 2018, the number of students in England awarded certifications in core maths, a level 3 qualification for students who have chosen not to study A-level maths, has almost doubled from 6,600 to 12,500.\n\nThe Department for Education confirmed it was making the cuts, but said it was looking for alternatives. \u201cWe are looking at all options, including other sources of funding, to make sure that the most important parts of this programme can continue,\u201d a spokesperson added.", "tag": "world-uk?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/aca9722c-27f7-44f6-9c67-81a33629a481"}, {"uuid4": "07ba9ad9-91a0-4d0c-ae35-026927613452", "title": "Can I continue to invest in my future wife\u2019s company?", "description": "I\u2019m worried that being married to the owner will affect my eligibility to invest via SEIS", "author": "Lucy Warwick-Ching", "published_date": "2025-01-29T05:00:47.793Z", "content": "My partner and I got engaged over Christmas and we\u2019re excited to begin thinking about setting a date for the wedding. My wife-to-be is an entrepreneur and last year I invested in one of her small businesses through the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS), to help the business grow and for the tax advantages the scheme offers. I plan to make further such investments over the coming years. However, will being married to the owner affect my eligibility to invest via SEIS? Are there any alternative venture capital schemes I could use which offer tax relief?\n\nGuy Wilmot, partner in the corporate and commercial team at law firm Russell-Cooke, says rules around SEIS are notoriously complicated, so it is right to think about this in advance. Unfortunately, it is likely that when you are married the previous relief will be disapplied and you will not be able to make further SEIS (or EIS) investments in your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s company.\n\nSEIS relief is not available if an investor is \u201cconnected\u201d to the company they invest in. An investor will be treated as being connected if they, together with their associates, hold more than 30 per cent of the company\u2019s shares or voting rights.\n\nAn associate\u00a0under these rules\u00a0includes a spouse, parents and grandparents, children and grandchildren. As such, for the purposes of SEIS and EIS, a married couple are treated as a single unit. If that married unit holds more than 30 per cent of the company\u2019s shares, the relief is not available. It is worth bearing in mind that extended family members, such as aunts, uncles and even brothers and sisters, may still be eligible to invest under EIS or SEIS.\n\nEven if the shareholdings were below the threshold, it is still highly likely that the relief would not apply because employees of a company (and their associates) are also connected with that company.\n\nThe test of whether an investor is connected to a company applies for three years after the investment is made. If the test is breached within that period, then the previous relief may be withdrawn. As your investment was made last year, a delay in the marriage of potentially more than two years might be needed to avoid withdrawal of the relief, which perhaps takes tax planning to an extreme level, but is of course a personal choice.\n\nAs you plan your future with your fianc\u00e9e, one option could be to consider becoming a part owner of the business. Gifts of shares between spouses do not attract CGT and there may be suitable strategies you could consider for supporting the growth of what will soon be a family business, including use of capital allowances.\n\nNeedless to say, couples considering merging business and financial interests on marriage will probably wish to take appropriate family law advice, potentially including putting in place a suitable pre- or postnuptial agreement.\n\nIt\u2019s natural and common for entrepreneurs to turn to friends and family when getting their business ventures off the ground. But entering into a marriage does change the nature of the relationship, not only with the entrepreneur, but also with the business.\n\nI am 75, living with my wife. We have two daughters, the younger one living and working in London. She is hoping to buy a flat and we are trying to downsize to help her fund the purchase. I am aware of the seven-year inheritance tax (IHT) rule.\n\nHowever, to reduce IHT on the estate (of less than \u00a31mn) we are also considering putting the house into trust for the two girls.\u00a0If we did that, would that make the London daughter part-owner of the house and prevent her from gaining first-time buyer privileges?\n\nHarry Cousens, an associate in the private client and tax team at Withersworldwide, says that with regard to your inheritance tax exposure, you should be aware that\u00a0everyone has a \u201cnil rate band\u201d of \u00a3325,000 to set against the value of their estate.\u00a0Also, where a residence or interest in it is inherited by children, an additional nil rate band (the \u201cresidence nil rate band\u201d) of \u00a3175,000 is available, in certain circumstances, where the individual downsizes and assets of an equivalent value were left on death to direct descendants. This means that on your death, it may be possible for your daughters to inherit your estate IHT-free (on the basis that your estate is still worth \u00a31mn or less).\n\nNevertheless, it is understandable that you may wish to make a lifetime gift to your daughter to help her on to the property ladder.\u00a0For inheritance tax purposes, a gift to your daughter will be classed as a potentially exempt transfer (Pet).\n\nPets can become taxable at a maximum of 40 per cent if you die within seven years of the gift, with a tapering scale if you survive the gift by more than three years. You and your wife should consider which of you (or both) should make the Pet in light of this.\n\nHowever, if you were to die within seven years of the gift, as outlined above, you should have your nil rate band of \u00a3325,000 to set against the value of the gift and the residence nil rate band may provide further relief. In addition, there is the \u2018annual small gift exemption\u2019 of \u00a33,000.\n\nIf you sell your property, this will count as a disposal for capital gains tax, but provided the property is your only home that you have lived in throughout your period of ownership, principal private residence relief would apply and no capital gains tax would be payable.\n\nTurning to the question of a trust, whether settling your home will create a stamp duty issue for your daughters depends on the trust\u2019s terms. If the girls have a right to occupy the property and/or receive any rental income, then this would jeopardise the availability of first-time buyers\u2019 relief and it would also result in the additional property surcharge (now 5 per cent, following the Autumn Budget) applying to the purchase of a property by your daughters.\n\nHowever, settling your property on trust is unlikely to be a good idea for other reasons.\u00a0First, to the extent the property is valued higher than \u00a3650,000 (assuming both you and your wife have your full nil rate bands available), an immediate 20 per cent inheritance tax charge would apply to the creation of the trust.\u00a0Second, if you continue to occupy the property you have given away, anti-avoidance provisions would apply, and the property would be treated as remaining in your estate for inheritance tax purposes.\n\nUnder current rules, with a joint estate worth less than \u00a31mn, your daughters are unlikely to have any further inheritance tax to pay if you survive the Pet of the excess sale proceeds by seven years.\u00a0The opinions in this column are intended for general information purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice.

Eutelsat shares have lost three quarters of their value since the deal was announced.\n\nThe UK\u2019s government\u2019s injection of funds into Orbex represents half the \u00a340mn the company had been hoping for in a fundraising launched last year.\n\nIn total Orbex has raised \u00a323mn in the series D round, including investments from the Export and Investment Fund of Denmark, Octopus Ventures and private investor Sohaib Abbas.\n\nChambers said having the UK government as \u201cpart of the consortium will really bolster\u201d the final fundraising efforts.\n\nThe UK\u2019s support for Orbex will be welcomed by the UK space industry, which has criticised successive governments for a failure to develop a clear space strategy.\n\nIan Annett, former deputy chief executive of the UK Space Agency and now an independent consultant in the industry, said he supported the investment. \u201cIt is a clear signal of the intention to support a competitive launch industry within Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving assured access to space, whether for security, economic prosperity or science, will be an important asset for the UK.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, the latest year for which accounts are available, Orbex reported pre-tax losses more than doubled to \u00a317.2mn.\u00a0The company has raised a total of \u00a3129mn in public and private funding since it was founded in 2015.", "tag": "world-uk?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5ed95ee5-fb27-47a0-b461-45749066dde8"}, {"uuid4": "50ca432e-55de-46fa-b7ea-317d6fd9cd4a", "title": "Rachel Reeves to warn that UK must \u2018fight\u2019 for economic growth  ", "description": "Chancellor will use keynote speech to signal she wants to face down opponents of development", "author": "Jim Pickard", "published_date": "2025-01-29T00:09:45.320Z", "content": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will promise to go \u201cfurther and faster\u201d to kick-start the UK economy in a major speech on Wednesday, as she tries to convince business that the government is committed to driving growth.\n\nReeves will signal she is prepared to have a \u201cfight\u201d with opponents \u2014 including environmentalists \u2014 who stand in the way of the government\u2019s planning reforms.\n\nThe chancellor is under pressure to reassure companies and investors after her tax-raising Budget in October, the government\u2019s package of employment reforms, and a rise in gilt yields amid fears about stagflation.\n\nReeves will confirm that the government is reviving plans for an \u201cOxford-Cambridge growth corridor\u201d as part of a broader push to liberalise the planning regime and ensure more homes are built.\n\nThe chancellor will also emphasise progress on an industrial strategy and signal her support for airport expansion in Greater London.\n\n\u201cFor too long we have accepted low expectations, accepted stagnation,\u201d Reeves will say in her speech. \u201cLow growth is not our destiny.

The ONS now assumes a long-term fertility rate of 1.45, down from 1.59 in the previous projections.\n\nThe latest figures showed that the fertility rate in England and Wales fell to 1.44 children per woman in 2023, the lowest since comparable data began in 1938.\n\nThe number of children aged under 15 years is projected to decrease by 797,000, from 12.4mn to 11.6mn, by mid-2032, according to the ONS.\n\nOn the other hand, the number of people of pensionable age is projected to increase by 1.7mn over the same period, or 14 per cent, from 12.0mn to 13.7mn, taking into account the planned increases in state pension age to 67 years for both sexes.\n\nThe UK\u2019s projected population growth contrasts with the population already shrinking in many countries, including Italy, Japan, and China. The German population is also expected to start shrinking in the next few years, according to UN population forecasts.\n\nIn the outlook to 2047, the ONS said that \u201cnet migration is projected to be the only source of population growth in the UK over the next 25 years\u201d.", "tag": "world-uk?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e064ce02-8ba5-45d7-84fa-c56ea8b427b1"}, {"uuid4": "6ec6a362-5d14-4b03-a8b5-ceb719931873", "title": "How Oxford and Cambridge spinouts could boost UK growth ", "description": "The path from ivory towers to commercialisation is fraught and clearer ground rules are needed", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-01-28T10:47:38.358Z", "content": "Running trains between Oxford and Cambridge to create a bigger research and development hub \u2014 as per plans revived by the UK government \u2014 is one way to foster economic growth. Easing the path for universities to spin out their innovations into business opportunities would be even smarter.\n\nTrue, the UK beats its European peers when it comes to commercialising research birthed in university labs. The country\u2019s universities have spawned more than 2,000 spinouts since 2011, according to the Royal Academy of Engineering. Stars include Carbon Re, an industrial artificial intelligence company, spun out of Cambridge and University College London.\n\nBut the path from ivory towers to commercialisation is fraught. Last year\u2019s equity investment of \u00a32.6bn, according to the Royal Academy of Engineering, ended a two-year decline but is still below the 2021 peak. That\u2019s about a 10th of the equity raised in the UK capital markets.\n\nClearer ground rules would help. Universities, founders and investors clash frequently. All would agree that value resides in intellectual property, but where the IP itself resides is a knottier issue. At Cambridge, the university gets first dibs. Compare that with Sweden\u2019s Uppsala University, which usually confers ownership on the originator. One case, involving the University of Oxford, wound up in court.\n\nThat is just one hurdle. Extricating spinouts can be laborious; academia moves slowly. As the UK government\u2019s 2023 review noted, panels are composed of committees that only meet irregularly and lack commercial experts. The average spinout took 10-12 months; for 16 per cent it was more than 16 months.\n\nUniversities are reluctant to cede much of their innovations: one in four spinouts began negotiations demanding a 50 per cent equity stake. Investors balk at being accorded just crumbs. This is improving \u2014 the average university equity stake at spinout fell to 18 per cent in 2023, from 25 per cent a decade ago \u2014 but there is scope for further loosening of the reins.\n\nAttracting and retaining human capital is a priority, and the UK is not alone in finding this challenging. Even the US, start-up central, is seeing STEM brains return to China; blockchain researcher Chen Jing is just the latest to forsake the US for Beijing\u2019s Tsinghua University.\n\nStructural challenges remain for the UK. Many universities are broke; nearly all lack the generous endowments that buoy the coffers of US institutions. There are limits to the amount of money that can be poured into the type of research projects that could be spun out.\n\nBut innovation is flourishing in the country\u2019s seats of learning, as is the government will to overcome constraints. Add in the trains and the UK just might have found a recipe for growth.\n\nlouise.lucas@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nThriv\u00ading uni\u00adversity spin\u00adouts must not be an Oxbridge pre\u00adserve / From Professor Nick Jennings, Vice-Chancellor & President, Loughborough University", "tag": "world-uk?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/70ba190d-5c11-4bed-8bf3-77759d77e8e6"}, {"uuid4": "74ea25b4-99af-48d2-810e-62730a7fdeb3", "title": "To seize AI\u2019s benefits, ministers must be prepared to fail in public ", "description": "DeepSeek\u2019s lower costs bode well for Keir Starmer, but government needs to be more open about its use of AI ", "author": "Georgina Quach", "published_date": "2025-01-28T09:50:13.116Z", "content": "Good morning. DeepSeek, a small Chinese artificial intelligence lab, has stunned the world and sent US tech stocks tumbling after unveiling its new R1 reasoning model. Its cheaper cost than rivals has called into question the business model of some of the big early players in AI.\n\nBut those lower overheads are good news for governments \u2014 including that of Keir Starmer \u2014 hoping that AI will allow them to trim the costs of public administration. If there is \u201cno moat\u201d in AI then governments stand to save money on paying for staff without having to lose the same money to high costs for one company\u2019s large language model or another.\n\nMinisters in the previous government of Rishi Sunak and that of Starmer rave about some private companies and the products they make. But Sunak recognised, rightly, that government needed to build its own sovereign capacity in AI, hence the thing likely to be his biggest positive legacy to the UK: the Incubator for Artificial Intelligence (i.AI). The AI unit in the Cabinet Office was launched in November 2023 in the hopes of expediting how information was compiled from different departments and allowing officials to make faster decisions. DeepSeek\u2019s success is a positive indicator for the UK and for all governments that want to do the same.\n\nIn addition to costs, the development in AI will also involve some big cultural changes in government. Some thoughts on one of them in today\u2019s note.\n\nLast week, the government unveiled a series of new tools that, it says, will make government run faster for less. Consult is designed to use AI to reduce the cost of running consultations with stakeholders by cutting the time allocated to a civil service task that ordinarily requires hours and hours. Ministers launch about 700-800 consultations a year. Parlex and Lex (no, not that Lex) both support in researching legislation but also model how MPs might react to a policy issue.\n\nAll of these and more are designed to do the same thing: reduce the amount of time the civil service spends on administrative tasks that do not require a human brain and reduce the amount of policy work that gets done on projects that will never be signed off by a special adviser or a minister.\n\nAlthough such technology is new, the spin is very, very old in that these are all the fruits of things that Sunak established as prime minister. Taking advantage of the good things your predecessor did is a long-standing political trick. The tools are also pretty much all in either alpha (ie \u201cwe aren\u2019t sure if this works\u201d) or beta stage (ie \u201cwe don\u2019t know how much help it actually is now we\u2019ve got it to work\u201d).\n\nPart of seizing the benefits of AI and digital government more broadly is transparency about what you\u2019re doing, why you\u2019re doing it and what is working and isn\u2019t. And one of the unalloyed positives about digital government in the UK has been the capacity to not only publish data on the outcomes of government efforts but also to show its working.\n\nA good thing about i.AI is that it has had a long history of failures: if you are not failing most of the time you either a) aren\u2019t really innovating or b) aren\u2019t being transparent about what you are doing or, worst of all c) you are releasing a lot of projects for public use that don\u2019t work to save face.\n\nThere\u2019s an inevitable tension here that goes right to the heart of why governments are less nimble than private companies. As a taxpayer I want both national and local government to innovate, experiment, and be prepared to get things wrong to deliver better public services. As someone who uses public services, I want those services to work first time.\n\nAnd governments of all stripes are incentivised not to fail publicly, even at development stage. As a result, government programmes are often \u201cdoomed to succeed\u201d: something that is announced, whether as an old-fashioned pilot programme or a newfangled beta test, is incentivised to progress to a proper rollout. That\u2019s because governments are beaten up for failing.\n\nThe negative headlines arising from the government\u2019s difficulties in getting AI models that actually work in the Department for Work and Pensions are a case in point (as reported by Robert Booth over at the Guardian). My concern here isn\u2019t that the government has had many unsuccessful pilots: that is a good thing, and part of government seizing the benefits of AI is going to be trying things at pilot stage that don\u2019t work. My worry is that the story emerged through a freedom of information request. Government needs to shake off its old, old addiction to failing in secrecy if it is going to get the benefits both of sharing knowledge about how AI works with households and businesses, and for us to trust how governments use AI.\n\nThis week, I mostly listened to Emma Rawicz\u2019s Chroma while writing my column.", "tag": "world-uk?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/003062b2-eb5c-42a9-8361-9211ed7a45ee"}, {"uuid4": "734aaf9d-ece2-4f3c-ae1b-d5cb1ffb87b1", "title": "Keir Starmer vows to \u2018hard wire growth\u2019 into cabinet decisions", "description": "Changes will require UK ministers to prove economic impact of policies before approval", "author": "George Parker", "published_date": "2025-01-28T09:34:40.543Z", "content": "Sir Keir Starmer has promised to \u201chard wire growth into all decisions in the cabinet\u201d, as he set out what he called a new approach to policymaking at a meeting with senior executives in the City of London.\n\nDowning Street said that in future all cabinet ministers would have to \u201cset out the growth credentials of new policies in order to get approval from their cabinet colleagues\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cgrowth impact of proposals will be subject to the same rigorous assessment that already applies to new public spending\u201d, No 10 added.\n\nStarmer\u2019s change to the Whitehall \u201cwrite round\u201d process for cabinet decisions \u2014 in which cabinet ministers are consulted on new policies \u2014 is intended to focus attention on the growth potential of new policies.\n\n\u201cEverything has to be seen through the question of whether it is pro-growth,\u201d Starmer told business executives on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe message came as chancellor Rachel Reeves prepared to give a speech on growth on Wednesday in which she will signal support for a third runway at Heathrow airport, a policy previously opposed by senior cabinet members, as well as the prime minister himself.\n\nStarmer and Reeves on Tuesday met executives in the City of London, where both adopted a notably bullish tone on the prospects for the British economy, in stark contrast to their gloomy rhetoric last year.\n\nBusiness leaders had warned that Reeves\u2019 insistence that she had been handed by the Conservatives \u201cthe worst economic inheritance\u201d of any UK government since the second world war had sucked confidence out of the economy.\n\nThey have also criticised the Labour government for introducing measures that executives say will hit growth, including a \u00a325bn national insurance increase on employers and new labour laws.\n\nAt a round-table breakfast, Reeves adopted a markedly more bullish tone than last year. \u201cIt\u2019s the role of government to shout about all the amazing things we are doing as a country,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe want to partner with you in business to showcase all the great things we have going for us,\u201d she added.\n\nReeves will use her speech on Wednesday to promise to go \u201cfurther and faster\u201d on growth, including greenlighting airport expansion in the south-east, a move that has caused unrest in Labour circles.\n\nIn the last House of Commons vote on a third runway at Heathrow in 2018, seven members of the current cabinet voted against it, including Starmer.

One answer is that these acts shake our sense of what it means to be human. That Axel Rudakubana could murder three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport last year, or that Salman Abedi could blow himself up at a Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in 2017, killing 22 people, many of them children, is incomprehensible to most of us. That someone could set out one day with the intent to murder and kill isn\u2019t something we can get our heads around.\n\nAbedi\u2019s horrific crimes are no easier to justify but they are, I think, easier to categorise and explain. Abedi was a jihadist extremist who believed that his murders would advance his cause. He was a man who convinced himself that his ends justified his violent and heinous means. Rudakubana is harder to understand: for him, his violent means were his ends. The Southport murders are shocking in part because we can\u2019t categorise them.\n\nRudakubana confounds us because he is beyond our imagination. I think we can all imagine what it would be to be a fanatic. We all believe in something and we can at least conceive of, if not fully understand, what it means to be willing to kill the innocent in the service of an idea. We can imagine, too, what it might mean to lose our reason and to commit horrific crimes due to a psychotic break.\n\nThe idea of someone first convincing themselves of the rightness of their cause online and then turning to violent means to advance it does not lie beyond our comprehension. But we struggle to understand someone for whom viewing violent acts online is in itself a source of motivation \u2014 a person who could view the horrors of the world and decide that they wanted to add to them simply because of a fascination with violence.\n\nCategorising extreme violence is also how governments degrade, undermine and defeat those who wish to commit it. In the UK, where Islamist extremism makes up 75 per cent of the counterterror caseload in Great Britain (together with a growing threat from the extreme right), understanding the ideologies that drive or justify acts of extreme violence is part of how we stop them. Doing so helps us decide when events might require extra security, or which individuals might need enhanced monitoring. It tells us where they might attack, and it helps our security services infiltrate and undermine organised terrorism.\n\nThat is part of how MI5 and the police have managed to foil 43 \u201clate stage\u201d terror plots since 2017. It is also how Prevent, another strand in the UK\u2019s counterterrorism strategy, has diverted many more away from the cause of terrorism.\n\nBut it is much harder to work out how to tackle and stop someone like Rudakubana who commits violent acts seemingly for violence\u2019s sake. His motivations are still further from our own than those of someone who commits horrific acts for an ideological reason.\n\nSo some \u2014 not least the UK prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer \u2014 think that the way to deal with what Christopher Wray, former director of the FBI, dubbed \u201csalad bar extremism\u201d, a pick and mix of incomprehensible rationales and ideological justifications for extreme violence, is to change the state\u2019s definition of terrorism. How a state, particularly a liberal democracy, defines terrorism matters because states sometimes use that definition to suspend some or all of the safeguards that define liberal democracies in the first place. But as Jonathan Hall, the UK\u2019s independent reviewer, has argued persuasively in these pages, one effect of expanding the definition of terrorism would be to significantly increase the number of areas in which we reduce and curtail the rights of individuals.\n\nWhat really matters is not how the British state has categorised Islamist extremism and the extreme right, but its understanding of what drives them \u2014 what their centres of power are and how to undermine them. Such an understanding is what has allowed the security services to defeat extreme animal rights activists, whose activities used to blight and terrorise scientific researchers.\n\nTo defeat violence for violence\u2019s sake, we need to understand what drives it in the way that we have at least begun to understand ideologically and religiously-driven acts of extreme violence. As strange and alien as extreme violence seems to us, we have to find a way to make it comprehensible if we are to protect ourselves from it. Although it will always remain hard for us to understand the acts of extremists, it is only through deeper understanding that we will be able to find greater security.\n\nstephen.bush@ft.com", "tag": "world-uk?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3445b327-a3d7-47ed-87f3-6a872a4f2ee6"}, {"uuid4": "2c2453bf-64ee-4df6-9198-25d4731f6953", "title": "UK competition agency will make \u2018rapid decisions\u2019, new chair says ", "description": "Newly installed Doug Gurr wants to improve relations with industries and spur investment ", "author": "Suzi Ring", "published_date": "2025-01-28T05:00:37.564Z", "content": "The UK\u2019s competition regulator will speed up its investigations in order to try to unlock greater investment into the country, the newly installed chair of the regulator has said.\n\nWriting in the Financial Times, Doug Gurr said the agency would make its merger and market investigations \u201cas simple and rapid as possible\u201d.\n\nThe CMA will also bring in greater sector expertise so that businesses do not have to waste time educating the regulator about their industry.\n\n\u201cWe know it costs businesses when they have to deal with lengthy and uncertain investigations,\u201d he said. \u201cGood decisions, clear decisions, rapid decisions \u2014 that\u2019s what you tell us you need and that\u2019s on us to deliver.\u201d\n\nGurr, the former head of Amazon UK, was named as the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s interim chair last week, after former chair Marcus Bokkerink was ousted by ministers.\n\nHe wrote that \u201ca regulatory environment that encourages the greatest possible\u00a0level of business investment\u201d would be the agency\u2019s new \u201cnorth star\u201d, while also stressing the need to protect consumers.\n\nGurr ran Amazon\u2019s British operations during the tech group\u2019s tussle with the CMA over its minority investment in Deliveroo and is expected to take a more friendly approach towards business.\n\nThe CMA was previously criticised for being too interventionist, with its delay in approving Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision seen as damaging the UK\u2019s standing internationally.\n\n\u201cLast year, the UK again delivered the lowest level of business investment in the G7.

She has also supported Britain aligning permanently with EU rules in established industries such as chemicals.\n\nShe said she was \u201cabsolutely happy\u201d to look at the idea of Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention, a customs agreement between the EU and 20 countries, including in the Middle East and Balkans.\n\nIt comes as EU diplomats warned that unless Starmer showed more ambition, his reset would do little to boost the UK economy. \u201cNone of this would have any impact on growth,\u201d said one.\n\nLabour\u2019s general election manifesto last year ruled out Britain rejoining the single market, customs union or adopting free movement, but Starmer and Reeves are now looking to show that the reset can yield economic gains.\n\nOne senior UK government official said: \u201cBritish business wants to avoid any kind of cliff edge or extra costs. We are looking for win-win solutions to build confidence and relinking our carbon markets falls into that category.\u201d\n\nThe UK government has been under mounting pressure from industry to announce it will align its ETS scheme with that of the EU in order to remove additional border bureaucracy. There are also growing concerns, for example in the steel industry, about the impact of a decision to introduce the UK\u2019s CBAM in 2027 \u2014 a full year later than the EU tax.\n\nAdam Berman, director of policy at lobby group Energy UK, said relinking the UK and EU carbon markets was \u201cthe only solution that protects British industry from the incoming EU CBAM.

A leaked internal document setting out the EU\u2019s negotiating positions last month said the majority of EU states were open to linkage, but on condition that the UK submitted to \u201cfull dynamic alignment\u201d with EU law, which would require the UK to replicate relevant EU legislation on the UK statute book.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s administration has indicated it views carbon border taxes as discriminatory and that they could be subject to retaliation under plans the US president has ordered to be drawn up \u201cwithin 60 days\u201d.\n\nSir Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat leader, has urged Starmer to be more ambitious with his UK-EU reset, and wants Britain to rejoin the customs union.\n\n\u201cIt is clear they are ready to talk seriously, they are worried about Trump too,\u201d he told the Financial Times. \u201cThis is the moment for Labour to take a risk, be ambitious and go for a deal that can actually jump-start the economy.\u201d\n\nLabour\u2019s manifesto set out limited ambitions for a reset, including a deal to facilitate trade in animal and plant products, the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and a deal to allow UK artists to tour freely across the EU.\n\nBrussels will demand a number of concessions from the UK in exchange for any deal, including continued access to British fishing waters. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing without fish,\u201d said one EU official.\n\nThe EU is also demanding a bilateral \u201cyouth experience scheme\u201d to allow under-30s to be able to travel and work in the UK and the bloc.

Without growth, there is no money to support the rebuilding of\u00a0our vital public services and no prosperity for hardworking people and families.\n\nBut what drives growth? And how can a regulator like the CMA play a part? Well, we know that dynamic, competitive markets drive growth. But another thing we know for sure is that business investment drives growth and that here in the UK we struggle with\u00a0business investment.\n\nLast year, the UK again delivered the lowest level of business investment in the G7. This has been true for far too long. And this is where the CMA comes in \u2014 because in my experience, there are many factors in any investment decision but a big one is confidence in a stable, coherent and well-informed regulatory environment.\n\nThis is our north star: a regulatory environment that encourages the greatest possible\u00a0level of business investment, subject to respecting the absolute importance of healthy competition and strong consumer protection. We want both domestic and international businesses to see the UK as a great place to invest.\n\nThis means giving start-ups and\u00a0venture backers the confidence to launch their businesses here, not elsewhere in the world. It means encouraging multinationals \u2014 who have a pretty much free\u00a0choice to place their investments anywhere in the Emea timezone \u2014 to choose the UK.\u00a0And it means giving our domestic businesses the encouragement and confidence to get\u00a0on and invest.\n\nWhat does that mean in practice and what is the CMA going to do differently? Well, here are three simple \u2014 but powerful \u2014 things we want to drive forward.\n\nFirst, efficiency: we have to make our investigations and processes as simple and rapid\u00a0as possible. We know it costs businesses when they have to deal with lengthy and uncertain investigations. Good decisions, clear decisions, rapid decisions \u2014 that\u2019s what you tell us you need and that\u2019s on us to deliver.\u00a0We\u2019re already off to a great start with the \u201c4Ps\u201d framework announced by our CEO late last year. Proportionality, predictability, process and pace are all critical areas for us to dig into and I am confident we can make real progress in the near future.\n\nSecond, expertise: the CMA has a wealth of talent and a committed workforce. But we\u00a0also know businesses can find it frustrating when they feel they have to spend their time educating us about their sector dynamics and issues. And, of course, the deeper our understanding, the better the decisions we make will be. So, once again, we\u2019ve\u00a0listened. We will build mechanisms to ensure we invest in, and can access, world\u00a0class expertise to enable a rapid, meaningful and grown-up conversation with every sector we investigate.\n\nFinally, engagement. Ultimately, we serve UK consumers. But our work has a direct impact on businesses across the UK and those looking to grow and invest here. So it\u2019s essential we engage directly and meaningfully with the business community. Our commitment is an open door, open ears and open minds.\n\nWe\u2019re not naive and we\u2019ll never move away from a belief in the power of competition and consumer\u00a0protection. But we want to hear what works for you \u2014 what\u2019s going to give you the confidence\u00a0to invest. We\u2019re looking forward to the first meeting of the CMA\u2019s Growth and Investment Council today to do just that.\u00a0The council was launched at the start of this year and brings together the leaders of 12 major UK business and investor groups.\n\nWe love the UK.

In the process, 750 homes and a primary school would be demolished.\n\nOther options, such as a smaller third runway within the airport\u2019s current boundaries, are not being considered, the people said, in part because the northwestern runway project has been through six years of scrutiny and was backed\u00a0by a government-appointed\u00a0Airports Commission in 2015, parliament in 2018 and the Supreme Court in 2020.\n\nThe biggest unknown is the project\u2019s price tag. A third runway at Heathrow would be one of the most expensive private sector infrastructure projects in the UK. The estimated cost was \u00a314bn in 2014, but that number would now be far higher.\n\nNoble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, said the costs had been rising quickly, and there were now questions over whether the UK had the construction skills to deliver a project of that size.\n\nA third runway would compete for workers with the government\u2019s plans to build 1.5mn homes over five years, as well as more transport and water infrastructure, data centres and gigafactories.\n\nThe number of people working in construction has fallen by 366,000 in the past five years and is at its second-lowest level since 2001.\n\n\u201cThe big question in construction is who will actually do all the work and how much more will it cost,\u201d Francis said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unclear whether we have the skills.\u201d\n\nAviation industry executives believe the expansion is so politically and technically challenging that Heathrow will want Reeves to go beyond simply signalling her approval for the idea of a third runway this week.\n\nThe airport\u2019s management will want clarity on how the government\u2019s planning reforms could smooth the way, including potential delays caused by judicial reviews, and a commitment to redrawing the UK\u2019s airspace to fit in all the new flights.\n\nBut, most of all, the government will need to agree to reform how Heathrow is financed.\n\nAs a regional monopoly, the airport is funded via the regulated asset base model much like the water companies, which raise equity and debt and recover the costs from consumers.\n\nHeathrow is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority, which agrees every five years on how much can be recouped from the take-off and landing charges it levies on airlines. These charges and the cost of servicing Heathrow\u2019s debt, at present about \u00a319bn, are passed on to passengers.\n\nHeathrow and its airline customers agree the airport\u2019s charging model needs to be reformed, but do not agree on how.\n\nOne option would be a far longer charging cycle \u2014 potentially as much as 25 years \u2014 to run alongside the current system to help pay for the runway.\n\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of lobby group Airlines UK, said carriers backed growth, but it must be \u201caffordable, aligned with industry\u2019s net zero commitments and deliver meaningful improvements in operational resilience\u201d.\n\nThe airport\u2019s next steps would be to submit a planning application for expansion, which would need to be granted a \u201cdevelopment consent order\u201d by the transport secretary.\n\nWhile there are live DCO applications for the Gatwick and Luton expansions, Heathrow\u2019s plans are not as advanced.\n\nSome experts believe the challenges of building a third runway are so significant that the project will never get off the ground.\n\nThe government has previously said no runway expansion would be authorised unless it is compatible with meeting Britain\u2019s climate targets, complies with noise pollution and air pollution limits and provides economic growth across the country.\n\nPaul McGuinness, chair of the No 3rd Runway Coalition pressure group, said: \u201cExpansions at other London airports undermine the case for Heathrow\u2019s uniquely complicated and costly third runway, making it an even riskier, if not uninvestable proposition.\u201d\n\nSir Keir Starmer, prime minister, voted against the scheme in 2018. Sir Sadiq Khan, Labour mayor of London, last week said that if Heathrow came back \u201cwith plans for a new runway that was supported by the government, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to launch, with partners and colleagues, another legal challenge\u201d.\n\nThe airport\u2019s new board met last week, following a change in its ownership, in which French private equity group Ardian and Saudi Arabia\u2019s deep-pocketed sovereign wealth fund bought a 38 per cent stake.\n\nThe board was supportive of expanding the airport in principle, ahead of hearing more details from Reeves, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nTony Travers, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, said it was a key moment for the government.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe scale of opposition to a third runway at Heathrow means the chancellor\u2019s renewed interest in it poses the ultimate test of the government\u2019s commitment to growth. Drive a third runway through, and pretty much any planning obstacle can be overcome.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/805085cc-eedb-4cd7-84da-60878599ba3f"}, {"uuid4": "0dcca0c7-14ed-46a8-a8ca-450e6eee4824", "title": "Scottish state bank risks missing 2030 investment target ", "description": "SNIB faces potential shortfall of \u00a3400mn on \u00a32bn lending budget, estimates show ", "author": "Ramsay Hodgson", "published_date": "2025-01-28T05:00:37.328Z", "content": "The Scottish National Investment Bank is at risk of missing its target of investing \u00a32bn by the end of the decade by a fifth, after the government scaled back funding for the lender this year.\n\nThe state bank could fall short of its 2030 goal in three areas \u2014 net zero, communities and innovation \u2014 by as much as \u00a3400mn, according to previously unreported figures from its annual report.\n\nEstablished in 2020, the bank has a mandate to fund projects that cut carbon emissions, reduce inequality and promote innovation. The institution has a target to lend \u00a32bn to businesses over 10 years.\n\nThe bank has previously come under scrutiny for getting off to a slow start in its early phases and for previously failing to meet its annual spending targets.\n\nThe lender\u2019s performance improved in the 2023-24 financial year, with it investing in green infrastructure and housing projects. The figure was \u00a3227mn up from \u00a3151.9mn the previous year, while its income exceeded operating costs for the first time.\n\nThe bank said it was a \u201clong-term impact investor\u201d, with 39 businesses and projects now in its portfolio.\n\n\u201cTo date we have committed \u00a3696mn to business and projects that deliver against at least one of our three missions of net zero, innovation and community, crowding in over \u00a31.4bn of additional investment alongside us,\u201d it said.\n\nIn its annual report published in August, the bank\u2019s projected spending by 2030 was between \u00a3800mn and \u00a31bn on net zero projects, and \u00a3400mn-\u00a3500mn each on both communities and innovation projects.\n\nAt the lower end of the range, this suggests a potential shortfall of \u00a3400mn against the \u00a32bn total target.\n\nIn its most recent business plan the lender said it was \u201caiming at the top end of each range and, where we can, exceeding it\u201d.

From April 1, the level at which the property levy becomes payable reverts to \u00a3300,000 from \u00a3425,000 for first-time buyers and to \u00a3125,000 from \u00a3250,000 for others.\n\nThe renters\u2019 rights bill, which aims to reform the private rental sector and end \u201cno fault\u201d evictions, could also affect the market. But Rightmove noted \u201cno major signs of an immediate impact\u201d from the legislation which could come into effect this year.\n\nThe Rightmove rental price tracker, as well as similar data from Homelet and Zoopla, provide a more timely indicator of rental trends than the official data, as they track new tenancies rather than all rents.\n\nRents outside London were still 4.7 per cent higher than at the end of 2023. However, price growth marked its slowest annual pace since early 2021.\n\nIn the capital, rental prices were up 2.4 per cent year on year, the lowest annual rate since early 2021.\n\nAlex Bloxham, partner and head of residential lettings at the property consultancy Bidwells, said:\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a cooling of what has been a ferociously hot rental market over the last year, where tenants have endured intense competition and consistent rental inflation.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fac17559-63cf-4825-83da-c0f7f9b03fc9"}, {"uuid4": "4505c875-848c-4391-b50a-81849477e22e", "title": "UK to give businesses greater access to pension scheme surpluses", "description": "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s plan is intended to drive investment by companies and boost economic growth", "author": "Maisie Grice", "published_date": "2025-01-28T00:01:11.693Z", "content": "Sir Keir Starmer will promise on Tuesday to unlock some of the \u00a3160bn of surplus held in corporate defined-benefit pension schemes, in a bid to inject a surge of cash into the British economy and boost growth.\n\nThe UK prime minister will tell an audience of executives in the City of London that restrictions on the use of pension surpluses will be eased, a move praised by former Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt.\n\nStarmer\u2019s decision is intended to drive investment by businesses while also encouraging them to take more risk in their pension investment strategies. \u201cToday\u2019s changes will unlock billions for investment,\u201d Starmer said.\n\nThe government estimates that about 3,750 corporate defined-benefit pension schemes are in surplus, holding \u00a3160bn of assets in excess of the payments they owe to their members. Less than \u00a370bn is eligible to be returned to companies under current rules. Total assets in the system are \u00a31.2tn.\n\n\u201cThis reform has the potential to fundamentally change the way employers view their defined-benefit pension schemes, transforming them from liabilities to offload, into valuable assets worth running on for the longer term,\u201d said Morten Nilsson, chief executive of Brightwell, which manages the BT pension scheme, the largest in the FTSE 100. BT\u2019s scheme is in deficit.\n\nAfter several weeks in which chancellor Rachel Reeves has made a series of growth-related announcements, Starmer\u2019s move on Tuesday will be an answer to critics that he has taken a back seat on the economy.\n\n\u201cTo achieve the change our country needs requires nothing short of rewiring our economy,\u201d Starmer will tell the bosses of Lloyds, Nationwide and Tesco, along with other executives. \u201cIt needs creative reform, the removal of hurdles and unrelenting focus.\u201d\n\nThe pension reforms follow criticism from some business leaders that Starmer and Reeves have undermined growth with a \u00a340bn Budget tax rise, a thicket of new employment laws and gloomy rhetoric.\n\nHunt floated the defined-benefit pension reforms in his 2023 Mansion House speech but ran out of time to deliver them before last year\u2019s election, which delivered Starmer and Labour into power.\n\n\u201cI may have my political differences with Rachel Reeves on business tax rises but I strongly welcome the momentum she has put behind the Mansion House reforms,\u201d Hunt told the Financial Times.\n\nUnder Labour\u2019s plans, DB schemes could change their rules to permit surplus extraction where the employer and the trustees of the pension scheme agree. The plans would require legislation.\n\nCurrently, DB scheme surplus can only be accessed where schemes passed a resolution by 2016 to retain the power, under a 2004 law passed by the last Labour government. Some schemes had large deficits and did not pass such resolutions.\n\nSurpluses are also only accessible if they exceed the level needed for a business to sell its scheme to an insurer. The UK\u2019s Pension Protection Fund estimates that \u00a368bn of the \u00a3160bn of the total current surplus meets this threshold.\n\nAround \u00a3180mn of surplus was accessed by companies between 2018 to 2023, according to government estimates last year. Businesses are taxed at 25 per cent on surpluses they receive.\n\nPension scheme funding levels have improved dramatically in recent years because higher government bond yields have increased expected returns on assets, therefore reducing the current accounting value of future liabilities.\n\nPension trustees welcomed the government\u2019s announcement, provided member outcomes were protected.\n\n\u201cAll trustees really care about is paying scheme members, but as a general theme we would be supportive of releasing surpluses in the right circumstances,\u201d said Vassos Vassou, council member of the Association of Professional Pension Trustees.\n\nHe noted that in recent years, companies with large surpluses in their pension schemes had opted to sell them to insurance companies in bulk annuity transactions called buyouts. About \u00a350bn of pension obligations have been sold in each of the past two years, according to consultancy WTW.\n\nSome advisers are sceptical that many companies will make use of Labour\u2019s reforms. \u201cI just don\u2019t think there will be many people who want to do it \u2014 either they want to do a buyout or just put more money into the scheme until they can,\u201d said John Ralfe, an independent pensions consultant. He noted the 25 per cent tax levied on cash extracted from pension surpluses.\n\nOn Monday Reeves urged Labour MPs to get behind the growth strategy, with some backbenchers nervous that the party is damaging its environmental credentials and appearing to side with business over consumer interests.\n\n\u201cIf we get this right \u2014 and I know we will \u2014 the prize on offer is immense,\u201d she told the Parliamentary Labour party. Reeves, who has been criticised by business for appearing to talk the economy down, urged Labour MPs to be positive. \u201cNow is the chance for us to shout about that potential and the brighter future ahead,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added: \u201cOver the past six months as chancellor, my experience is that government has become used to saying \u2018no\u2019.

Kennedy noted that all his children were vaccinated, adding that he supported both the polio and measles vaccines. \u201cI believe that vaccines play a critical role in healthcare,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic Senator Ron Wyden said Kennedy had \u201cembraced conspiracy theories, quacks, charlatans\u201d, while his colleague Elizabeth Warren said \u201ckids might die\u201d because of Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine stance while he \u201ccan keep cashing in\u201d from his role in vaccine safety lawsuits.\n\nRepublicans James Lankford and Thom Tillis, both viewed as possible opponents to Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, took a more conciliatory approach. Kennedy assured Lankford that he would back the president\u2019s policies on abortion. Tillis said he expected the vote to split along party lines: \u201cSome of these nominations are going to be shirts and skins.\u201d\n\nKennedy said his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d campaign would solve chronic disease in the US, which he claimed was costing the country $4.3tn a year.\n\nKennedy also said he had been labelled a \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d to prevent him from \u201casking difficult questions of powerful interests\u201d.\n\nKennedy also sought to downplay Republican concerns over his plan to shake up the food industry. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take food away from anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you like a cheeseburger \u2014 a McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger and a Diet Coke like my boss \u2014 you should be able to get them.\u201d\n\nKennedy was grilled by Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, another crucial vote in getting him confirmed, over his plans to reform the state-backed Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programmes. \u201cI don\u2019t have a broad proposal for dismantling the programme,\u201d he said.", "tag": "us?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d2300063-ae5d-42f4-b209-115743f5d9eb"}, {"uuid4": "3d7d9c7b-6e8b-4507-a779-87f8e8aa1119", "title": "DeepSeek sticks a fork in utility investors\u2019 socket", "description": "A slowdown would be better news for the energy transition", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-01-29T17:34:16.782Z", "content": "One of the hottest debates in the energy sector over the past year has been exactly how much power artificial intelligence was going to soak up \u2014 and what the impact of this was going to be. On suppliers: good. On the green transition: mostly bad.\n\nDeepSeek has turned such conversations on their head. Following the Chinese group\u2019s release of a massively more efficient large language model, the question now is how much energy demand forecasts will need to be revised down \u2014 and where that leaves the utilities in this space.\n\nIt\u2019s mainly a US issue. While the need for rapid answers means that data centres required to use AI products are best located close to their clients, those needed to train the models can be built where power is cheap. Europe, with its expensive electricity, was always going to be a bit player here \u2014 and has hence been relatively insulated both from the excitement that gripped US utilities and from this week\u2019s ructions.\n\nIntuitively, it seems clear that US power forecasts are due for a cut. Training DeepSeek\u2019s model required less than a tenth of the computing power required to train Meta\u2019s Llama. The impact on power demand may not be entirely commensurate given data centres still need to be cooled, but this is game-changing efficiency.\n\nOnce up and running, DeepSeek may also be more efficient to use than, say, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, because it can apparently switch off the parts of its brain it\u2019s not using. True, lower costs may result in higher usage \u2014 as chipmakers the world over hope. But the risks are clearly on the downside.\n\nSuch insights are hard to translate into new long-term forecasts \u2014 not least because US electricity projections looked a bit dubious anyway. There are a lot of them. And they say very different things. That makes it difficult to understand what assumptions were baked in in the first place.\n\nMore pertinently, even if one believes that cheaper and more efficient AI leads to more AI overall, that is not going to do much to reassure investors in the US power sector. After all, assuming DeepSeek really has changed the AI calculus, greater uncertainty over the eventual shape and location of demand ought to make so-called hyperscalers more wary of committing to long-term energy contracts.\n\nOf course, while a slowdown would be bad news for energy stocks, it would be better news for the energy transition. A rapid increase in power demand would have been partly met by building new gas-fired plants. A more gradual approach gives renewables, batteries and nuclear power a better chance of filling the gap. One lesson from the DeepSeek drama is that AI can benefit the world even as it scorches some investors\u2019 portfolios.\n\ncamilla.palladino@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b9461632-3282-4980-a6b1-31449430bad5"}, {"uuid4": "620ff14f-e72a-453d-8915-b84cdcf19e8f", "title": "Nvidia shares resume fall despite gains in European chip stocks", "description": "ASML shares rally as Dutch group hails DeepSeek as \u2018good news\u2019", "author": "Tim Bradshaw", "published_date": "2025-01-29T17:33:45.296Z", "content": "Nvidia shares fell on Wednesday even as chipmakers in Europe and Asia rebounded following strong earnings from Dutch group ASML.\n\nThe US chipmaker fell 4.8 per cent in New York ahead of a flurry of Big Tech earnings later in the day, having rebounded nearly 9 per cent in the previous session.

There is a reason why the Fed is independent,\u201d Sahm said, adding that she expected the central bank to \u201cstick to its goals\u201d.\n\nPowell has helped steer the US economy towards a soft landing over the past year, curbing price rises without pushing the economy into recession.\n\nBut inflation remains above the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target, even though it has eased sufficiently for the Fed to cut interest rates last year by a percentage point to a range between 4.25 and 4.5 per cent.\n\nWhile the market widely expects the Fed to keep rates on hold on Wednesday, Trump has made clear he wants much faster reductions.\n\n\u201cI think I know interest rates much better than they do, and I think I know them certainly much better than the one who\u2019s primarily in charge of making that decision,\u201d the president said last week. \u201cI\u2019d like to see [interest rates] come down a lot.\u201d\n\nLawrence Summers, who served as Treasury secretary under president Bill Clinton, argued that such \u201cpublic interventions by governments can easily be counterproductive\u201d. He added: \u201cThe Fed won\u2019t listen.\u201d\n\nCentral banks across the world were granted full control to set interest rates after a wave of inflation during the 1970s and 1980s proved difficult to tame in an environment where political interference in monetary policy was rife.\n\nFew elected leaders have interfered in rate-setters\u2019 decisions since, with exceptions such as Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan undermining market confidence and stoking price pressures.\n\n\u201cNow that Trump has been calling quite vocally for lower interest rates, if the Fed eases monetary policy it will create the impression that they caved to him and forfeited their independence,\u201d said Isabella Weber, economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\nThe US central bank is already set to cut interest rates less aggressively than its counterpart in the Eurozone.\n\nThe possibility of several price shocks hitting the US economy \u2014 including ones instigated by the president himself \u2014 could also delay the two cuts that most Fed officials and markets expect this year.\n\nSome think the Trump administration\u2019s plans for tariffs and tax cuts, as well as a possible uptick in economic activity and in the markets, will prohibit lower US borrowing costs.\n\n\u201cUnless there is a collapse in financial market exuberance, which I think is a real possibility, my guess is that the Fed will have difficulty in cutting as much as it expects,\u201d Summers said.\n\nThe central bank is keen to play down tensions with the White House. Powell is expected to duck questions on politics and avoid mentioning Trump by name in his post-meeting press conference on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIn the transcript for [the] December [press conference] the name of the president appears once in total. And that\u2019s because a reporter used it,\u201d said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Investments and a former Fed official. \u201cPowell doesn\u2019t want to talk about politics.\u201d\n\nEconomists expect that the Fed chief will instead stick to the central bank\u2019s script, emphasising that rate-setters will follow the data, rather than trying to anticipate the impact of Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nSome see a danger that such an approach would result in the Fed underplaying the threats in bringing inflation down to 2 per cent, especially in the guidance it gives.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t act in advance of political decisions that are uncertain. So they cannot provide satisfying guidance about policy,\u201d said Reinhart.\n\nDespite his demands on the Fed chief, Trump has indicated that he would not remove Powell from his post before his term as chair ends in May 2026. Powell has signalled he would fight in the courts if the president attempted to oust him.\n\nSome view the pressure on the Fed as part of the trade-off for being able to set rates as its officials see fit.\n\n\u201cThe most persuasive argument for why politicians decided to make central banks independent is that they wanted somebody else to blame,\u201d said Reinhart.\n\n\u201cThat means the quid pro quo for being independent is being criticised. And chair Powell appreciates that,\u201d he added. \u201cA central banker is going to be disliked.\u201d\n\nData visualisation by Joel Suss in London", "tag": "us?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/692aba10-5e1c-43ea-801a-e1d697aaef42"}, {"uuid4": "1a42f138-2a79-4cc4-acd7-905589246d3c", "title": "An insider guide to Miami\u2019s craft cocktail scene", "description": "Meet the new wave of bartenders shaking things up in the Magic City", "author": "Cheryl Tiu", "published_date": "2025-01-29T05:00:48.054Z", "content": "This article is part of FT Globetrotter\u2019s guide to Miami\n\nMiami\u2019s cocktail scene has never been short of vibrant. But these days it\u2019s more abuzz than ever. When bars like Broken Shaker and Sweet Liberty opened around a decade ago, they demonstrated that tropical-inspired craft cocktails could go beyond the daiquiri and the mojito \u2014 and beyond the velvet ropes and stringent dress codes of South Beach. Their fun yet complex beverages \u2014 Broken Shaker\u2019s Old-Fashioned infused with Cocoa Puffs, Sweet Liberty\u2019s pi\u00f1a colada with coffee beans and PX sherry \u2014 are paired with come-as-you-are vibes. It\u2019s a combination that has earned them both national and international accolades.\n\nFollowing in their footsteps, Caf\u00e9 La Trova, run by Julio Cabrera, opened in 2019 in Little Havana and put a spotlight on the Cuban cantinero-style of bartender \u2014 known for \u201cthrowing\u201d cocktails, memorising more than 200 recipes and dressing formally in long sleeves, waistcoats and bow-ties. Cabrera trained as a cantinero in Cuba in the 1980s, and in 2023 he received an \u201cindustry icon\u201d award from North America\u2019s 50 Best Bars. He\u2019s also one of the key inspirations for a new generation of impassioned bartenders and exciting cocktail bars, found in residential buildings, hotels and even a food hall.\u00a0These are some of the city\u2019s best.\n\nBar Kaiju sits on the mezzanine level of The Citadel food hall in the Little River neighbourhood. The glowing red space is decorated with posters of mythical creatures, and each cocktail is inspired by a monster in terms of ingredients, taste profile and strength.\n\n\u201cI themed Kaiju around monsters to celebrate the interconnectivity and creativity shared across cultures,\u201d says owner and anime-fan Derek Stilmann. \u201cThese creatures symbolise indescribable moments, lessons and dreams, evoking nostalgia and connecting us to our childhoods. I aimed to link our guests to both old and new tales, allowing them to explore the world through the menu and bar.\u201d\n\nStilmann has organised the menu into three core sections: carbonated, sour/tropical and spirit-forward/strong. Chukwa (the colossal \u201cworld turtle\u201d from Hindu mythology) is a carbonated milk punch inspired by the Indian yoghurt-drink lassi, built with single malt whiskey, mango, cardamom and coconut. The ingredients may sound complex but they go together very smoothly. G\u00fcije (a creature said to dwell in rivers and lagoons in Cuba) is a tropical, slightly sweet and savoury rum cocktail spiced with mojo criollo (a citrus and garlic Cuban marinade), rounded out with mango and served in a hand-painted cup. And Yara-Ma-Yha-Who (a monster from Australia that preys on unsuspecting travellers) is a remake of the 1930s New Orleans cocktail Vieux Carr\u00e9, with coconut-infused rye whiskey, cognac, sweet vermouth and fig, topped with a piece of white chocolate.\n\nClassic Italian cocktails are done exceptionally well at ViceVersa, a dark- green aperitivo bar in Downtown Miami that opened its doors last June. \u201cThe first cocktails I ever made were negronis and americanos,\u201d says Rome-born co-owner Valentino Longo, who in 2020 won the Tales of the Cocktail Foundation\u2019s North America\u2019s Most Imaginative Bartender competition. \u201cIn Italy, everyone has bottles of vermouth and amaro in their homes. I wanted to bring a little bit of my culture to Miami and offer a contemporary look at aperitivo.\u201d\n\nThe house negroni has a base of its own-made dolce amaro blend, MI-TO (Milano-Torino), and is built with gin then garnished with a lime as well as orange and lemon twists, in a nod to Miami\u2019s tropical locale. The savoury martini doppio is a slightly dirty Gibson, served with a powerful onion pickled in sherry vinegar, dry vermouth, juniper, oregano and thyme. The Vice President, meanwhile, is a potent rum Manhattan \u2014 with more fortified wine than rum \u2014 topped with a negroni-infused cherry.\n\nNon-alcoholic cocktails are also available upon request, and Longo recommends the N/A spritz. \u201cWe make this with Martini Floreale, which has the same botanicals as a regular aperitivo \u2014 lemon and orange peels, rhubarb, Roman chamomile.\u201d\n\nThe food here is created in partnership with the Sunny\u2019s steakhouse team with the kitchen overseen by Carey Hynes \u2014 it\u2019s run by executive chef Justin Flit (formerly of Jaguar Sun). Don\u2019t skip the white-sauce clam pizza with middleneck clams. And on Mondays from 5pm they do a special ViceVersa burger that\u2019s extremely popular with locals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m originally from Miami,\u201d says Alexa Delgado, director of bars at The Miami Beach Edition hotel, home to chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s Matador Room restaurant and the adjacent Matador Bar. \u201cI was born right before Hurricane Andrew \u2014 something that drastically defined the city.\u201d It was also a reference point for her signature Cat 5 cocktail, a vodka-based refresher built with Sauvignon Blanc, guava, lemon and catnip. \u201cIt encompasses category-five hurricanes \u2014 it\u2019s made of five ingredients \u2014 but\u00a0it\u2019s also served in a kitschy, bespoke white-ceramic cat cup. But more than that, I really wanted it to represent the resilience of Miami and South Florida after the storms.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the drinks on the Matador Bar menu were crafted around various team members\u2019 perspectives of Miami, most of whom have moved here from out of state. On paper, the negroni colada may give the impression that it\u2019s a sweet blend of pineapple and coconut, but on the contrary, it\u2019s a stirred-down, spirit-forward bitter cocktail. \u201cIt\u2019s more the essence of tropical life,\u201d says Delgado. The non-alcoholic options are no less refreshing, including Sowing Seeds, made with distilled herbal botanicals, cucumber, ginger and lemon. Guests can choose to sit in the cosy walnut-panelled bar \u2014 often busy during after-work hours \u2014 or on the airy terrace, which is especially pretty come sundown.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks their martini recipe is the only martini recipe,\u201d says Sunny\u2019s co-owner Will Thompson. His choose-your-own-martini menu offers guests five kinds of gin, four kinds of vodka, whether they\u2019d like it dry 50/50, dirty or filthy, and an assortment of garnishes (do try the house blue-cheese olives). \u201cWe have a martini that\u2019s \u2018Our Way\u2019 with manzanilla sherry and frozen gin, but the point of this martini section is to get guests to give us the information to make the cocktail that\u2019s right for them.\u201d\n\nThis way of making people feel welcome, seen and heard while having a great time is a gift that the Boston-born Thompson possesses. It was the backbone of his first bar, Jaguar Sun in Downtown Miami, which received the Exceptional Cocktails award from the Florida Michelin Guide in 2023. While Jaguar Sun has closed its doors, its spirit lives on at Sunny\u2019s, the permanent iteration of its pandemic pop-up, which opened in October. Some drinks were carried over too, including the signature Green Ghoul \u2014 a margarita made with poblano pepper-infused tequila and mezcal, cucumber, lime and salt \u2014 and the low-ABV Valiant, with gentian liqueur, Cocchi Americano, lemon, orange bitters and salt.\n\nWhile steaks are the name of the game here \u2014 Aaron Brooks, formerly of Four Seasons Miami\u2019s Edge Steak and Bar, is executive chef \u2014 Sunny\u2019s also has an impressive raw bar. My favourites include the scallops served with aguachile negro and pickled chayote; and the Ko egg \u2014 soft-cooked, atop onion sauce and served with ossetra caviar and fingerling-potato chips, it\u2019s inspired by chef-partner Carey Hynes\u2019s time at Momofuku Ko in New York.\n\nTrue to its name, The Champagne Bar at The Surf Club has one of Miami\u2019s largest selections of champagne \u2014 more than 100 varieties \u2014 but people are also drawn to the storied, palm-fringed bar in the Four Seasons Surfside hotel for its extremely precise, elegant and dexterously crafted cocktails. The menu is a collaboration between director of bars Jonathan Gabbay, who oversees the entire beverage programme; head mixologist Leo Varona, who handles the creative side; and lead bartender Larry Olea, who manages the day-to-day operations \u2014 hailing from France, Colombia and the Dominican Republic respectively.\n\n\u201c[We drew] inspiration from Miami\u2019s vibrant and diverse neighbourhoods, with each area represented through signature cocktails that celebrate its unique history, culture and flavours,\u201d says Varona. Case in point, Lemon City is named after the historical district now known as Little Haiti; the refreshing tribute to the area\u2019s abundant lemon groves features gin infused with lemon and lemongrass, hints of mezcal and coconut water, topped with a limoncello foam. Banana Cabana, meanwhile, is a playful take on the classic banana daiquiri and a homage to the poolside cabanas of Miami Beach, crafted with bourbon, rum, banana and coconut cordial and sherry. Most of the cocktails on the menu can also be enjoyed as a non-alcoholic option, while bar bites include Hokkaido-scallop skewers and saffron arancini with spicy bluefin tuna tartare by executive chef Marco Calenzo. Plus there\u2019s live music on weekends, when the in-house DJ is joined by a saxophonist or violinist.\n\nWho in your opinion does the best cocktails in Miami? Tell us in the comments below.

It assesses more than 10,000 ETFs and its latest data indicates that 7.7 per cent of them included securities sanctioned by one or more government, and that there has been a 700 per cent increase in the number of sanctioned securities over the past two years.\n\n\u201cWith sanctions, to some extent, you have to try to predict the future,\u201d said Sara Nordin, partner at law firm White & Case.\n\nSIX SSMS said the majority of the ETFs holding sanctioned securities were domiciled in China, the US and Ireland, in that order, but this statistic did not mean the ETFs were in breach of any domestic regulations.\n\nFor example, the recent decision by the US to add to the blacklist of sanctioned Chinese companies deemed to have links to Beijing\u2019s military resulted in the removal of a group of telecoms companies from global indices, but that does not mean domestic Hong Kong or Chinese investors cannot invest in them.\n\n\u201cAssessing exposure in ETFs is complex, and vigilance is just as paramount for issuers as it is for brokers and other investors,\u201d said Oliver Bodmer, senior product manager at SIX Financial Information.\n\nThe complexity deepens because of the different rules applied by different jurisdictions.\n\n\u201c[ETF] Issuers need to stay on top of securities sanctioned in their jurisdiction, but also in the jurisdictions of the investors they intend to target for the instrument,\u201d Bodmer said.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, investors must ensure they are not investing in funds that hold sanctioned securities beyond the prescribed thresholds \u2014 which varies by jurisdiction and sanctions regime.\u201d\n\nSanctions imposed by successive US administrations already include pages of orders limiting trading or other dealings with, for example, corporations identified as being involved in the Chinese military industrial complex as well as entities connected to Iran and Russia.\n\nThe EU has its own list that focuses strongly on Russia. The UK, too, has its own sanctions list.\n\nBut those working to advise the industry point out that risk assessment for fund managers and investors requires more than simply referring to a list.\n\n\u201cThe chain of exposure to sanctions could potentially be endless, for example if a sanctions measure prohibits \u2018indirect\u2019 transactions, through one or more third parties, with sanctioned persons,\u201d said Nordin, who has also seen a jump in demand for its sanctions-related advice.\n\n\u201cWhether a company would be liable for any sanctions violation that may arise as a result of indirect transactions with sanctioned persons generally comes down to diligence and risk management,\u201d she added.\n\nRisk management also depends on how likely a violation will be identified and pursued by authorities, as well as whether there can be any defence of an alleged violation and what the likely penalty will be.\n\nLawyers said that in the EU there are legal principles that mean that if you can show you have made reasonable efforts to carry out due diligence, such as by using a reputable screening service, then the regulator might accept this as a reasonable defence.\n\nIn contrast, the US Office of Foreign Assets Control operates on a so-called strict liability basis, which means that \u201ca person subject to US jurisdiction may be held civilly liable even if such person did not have knowledge that it was engaging in a transaction that was prohibited under sanctions laws and regulations\u201d, Ofac explains on its website.\n\nOfac also pursues so-called secondary sanctions, which can target non-US entities engaging in activities with sanctioned parties, even if those activities have no direct connection to the US.\n\nThe penalties can be severe. Last year EFG International, a Swiss private banking group, agreed to pay $3.7mn to settle an \u201capparent violation\u201d of the US\u2019s Cuban Asset Control Regulations. Ofac said the amount reflected the fact that EFG\u2019s \u201capparent violations were voluntarily self-disclosed and were non-egregious\u201d \u2014 in other words, the penalty could have been much higher.\n\nNavigating possible exposure to sanctions risks falls heavily on asset managers and can affect the value of investments held by retail investors too.\n\nHowever, Kenneth Lamont, principal at Morningstar, said there should be no surprises for end investors. \u201cI would argue the very real potential for investment restrictions is less of a compliance issue and more of an investment risk baked into investing in some emerging markets,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBroadly speaking, if we see a new wave of sanctions on companies Chinese or otherwise, this will increase compliance costs,\u201d he added, though he pointed out these increased costs would \u201cstill pale in comparison\u201d when compared with compliance costs around environmental social and governance factors and consumer duty.", "tag": "us?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8aa30442-3063-46c8-91e0-732d23af18cf"}, {"uuid4": "bbe4effb-9113-40bb-bbeb-124ab76649c8", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s commerce nominee Howard Lutnick accused of conflict of interest", "description": "Billionaire entrepreneur expected to be confirmed after senate hearing", "author": "Joe Miller", "published_date": "2025-01-29T05:00:47.694Z", "content": "Billionaire businessman Howard Lutnick will face a senate hearing on Wednesday for his nomination to be Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of commerce, as questions swirl over whether his pledge to unwind his significant holdings will be enough to avoid numerous conflicts of interest.\n\nIf confirmed, the chief executive of Wall Street brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald and major Trump donor will be the president\u2019s emissary to the business community he once helped lead \u2014 and will oversee a department with sway over many of his prior interests, including cryptocurrencies, the commercial satellite sector and the microchip industry.\n\nTrump nominated Lutnick to \u201clead our tariff and trade agenda\u201d, although the commerce department typically focuses on priorities such as patents and economic data, the national weather service, the census and, recently, chip manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWe plan to end the decades of policies that threw American workers to the wolves,\u201d Lutnick said in a speech during Trump\u2019s inauguration festivities.\n\nIn a letter to ethics officials, Lutnick said he would resign from his brokerage firm and divest his holdings in a host of companies \u2014 including BGC Group, which has a joint-venture with a Chinese company \u2014 if confirmed as commerce secretary.\n\nBut while he pledged that his wife and young children would not purchase the divested assets, he did not give a similar assurance about his adult children, two of whom work for Cantor companies. Without this, Lutnick\u2019s divestments mean \u201cvery little in practical terms\u201d, said Tony Carrk, the executive director of the advocacy group Accountable.us.\n\nCarrk said: \u201cIt\u2019s what Lutnick didn\u2019t say that speaks volumes\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009from what we see, Lutnick\u2019s conflicts of interest will continue to loom over the department, and that could cost everyday consumers.\u201d\n\nCantor declined to comment.\n\nOne of Cantor\u2019s largest holdings \u2014 it recently reported a $1.2bn stake \u2014 is in AI chipmaker Nvidia. Under former president Joe Biden, the commerce department was delegated to investigate how Nvidia chips ended up in China, despite a US ban on advanced semiconductor exports.\n\nA vocal cheerleader for crypto, Lutnick has a strong interest in the stablecoin Tether, in which Cantor has a stake of an undisclosed size. The financial services firm also manages a significant portion of Tether\u2019s reserves, now primarily held in US Treasury bills.\n\nWithin the commerce department sits the Office of Space Commerce, which has jurisdiction over radio spectra used by satellites and exports of aerospace products, among other matters. Cantor is invested in Uruguay-based earth observation company Satellogic, which has a long-standing commercial partnership with fellow billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, and has established a US presence in an attempt to win lucrative government contracts in its own right.\n\nLutnick resigned from Satellogic\u2019s board in November, following Trump\u2019s win.\n\nLast month, Cantor agreed to pay a $6.75mn penalty to settle charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly making misleading statements to investors in the lead up to two public offerings that raised $750mn. The company has also had multiple run-ins with other federal regulatory bodies, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\n\nAlthough Lutnick plans to resign as Cantor\u2019s chief executive and sell his stake within 90 days of being confirmed, some of his family will remain embedded in the firm.\n\nThe entrepreneur\u2019s son Brandon, who previously worked for Tether, took the helm of Cantor\u2019s newest blank-cheque company last month, according to regulatory filings. The special purpose acquisition company plans to raise $200mn and merge with a private enterprise.\n\nLutnick is expected to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nTed Cruz, who chairs the committee that will question Lutnick, said he was \u201can excellent choice\u201d to lead the commerce department, and that \u201chis vast experience will serve him well in his mission to promote America\u2019s unlimited entrepreneurial spirit\u201d.", "tag": "us?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/25f79264-0557-49c3-bf8b-a645f63482d0"}, {"uuid4": "84250574-f024-469f-a91f-70e6680a2663", "title": "Inside the Trump tariff debate", "description": "US Treasury secretary wants levies to rise month by month, starting at 2.5%", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-01-29T05:00:00.000Z", "content": "Advances in artificial intelligence by Chinese start-up DeepSeek caused a frantic sell-off of energy and infrastructure shares, and Donald Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary is pushing for new universal tariffs to start at 2.5 per cent.

It included a \u201cdeferred resignation letter\u201d for anyone who wanted to participate.\n\nAdministration officials said the offer was available to all full-time federal employees except for members of the armed forces, the US Postal Service and positions related to immigration enforcement.\n\nFederal employees may choose to return to work in the office full-time, but those workers could be cut later, according to a copy of the White House\u2019s memo seen by the Financial Times.\n\n\u201cAt this time we cannot give you full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency but should your position be eliminated you will be treated with dignity and will be afforded protections in place for such position,\u201d the memo read.\n\nThe memo to employees follows a series of executive orders President Donald Trump signed last week requiring employees return to the office full-time, altering hiring processes and updating the system to assess senior government workers.\n\nThe move, less than two weeks after Trump returned to the presidency, comes while he rushes to slash federal spending as he implements an agenda to deregulate the US economy and downsize the government.\n\nTrump appointed billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) with the job of finding federal programmes to slash. Ramaswamy has already departed from Doge.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House issued a memo freezing federal payments to programmes, including those helping the country\u2019s poor, but a federal judge blocked the plan just minutes before it was to take effect.\n\nLast week, Trump\u2019s administration halted foreign aid programmes and moved to scrap loans and grants for clean energy projects.\n\nOn Tuesday, secretary of state Marco Rubio approved an additional waiver for life-saving humanitarian assistance, which he defined\u00a0as \u201ccore life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter and subsistence assistance\u201d.\n\nThe Republican president expects that \u201cthe majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized\u201d, though some agencies and military branches could see increases in the size of their work force, the memo said.\n\nThe offer could affect large swaths of the federal workforce. A December report from the Office of Personnel Management found that 43 per cent of civilian federal workers engaged in telework on \u201ca routine or situational\u201d basis.\n\nA senior administration official said they anticipated 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the federal workforce would take the redundancy offer.

Social Security and Medicare, the government healthcare plan for older people, would also be untouched, the administration clarified.\n\nDemocrats blasted the proposed freeze as an illegal power grab by the president and warned that it would potentially harm the US economy.\n\n\u201cFreezing federal funding that has already been allocated by Congress is unconstitutional; above all else, it\u2019s inhumane,\u201d said Dick Durbin, the Democratic senator from Illinois.\n\nTwo senior Democrats, Patty Murray and Rosa DeLauro, wrote to Matthew Vaeth, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, saying: \u201cThe scope of what you are ordering is breathtaking, unprecedented, and will have devastating consequences across the country.\u201d\n\nA group of 23 state attorneys-general led by California and New York said they would file a separate lawsuit seeking to block the plan.\n\nThe online Medicaid portal used by states stopped working on Tuesday, which the White House said it was aware of. Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said on X that \u201cno payments have been affected\u201d.\n\nTuesday\u2019s move by the president came after he ordered a halt to funding for clean energy projects and virtually all foreign aid.\n\nIn the first memo ordering the freeze, the administration told agencies to submit information about their grants and loans to the White House by February 10, leaving many programmes in limbo until at least then.\n\nThe administration said the US spent $3tn in the 2024 fiscal year on federal financial assistance, but it is unclear how much of that would ultimately be cut.\n\nA radical revamp of the federal government has long been sought by Russell Vought, the president\u2019s pick to be White House budget director, and the authors of Project 2025, a blueprint for the incoming Republican administration assembled in recent years by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank.\n\nTrump distanced himself from Project 2025 during the election campaign against Joe Biden and Kamala Harris last year, since many of its prescriptions were too controversial, but some of its policies are appearing in his first executive actions.\n\n", "tag": "us?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8be21970-6709-4cb3-941d-efb92d457cdf"}, {"uuid4": "2d16aa6b-f761-4405-a1b8-358b3d68a2ab", "title": "Big majority of Greenlanders do not want to be part of US, poll finds", "description": "Survey is first to be done since Trump revived his interest in buying Arctic island", "author": "Richard Milne", "published_date": "2025-01-28T22:11:33.747Z", "content": "An overwhelming majority of Greenlanders have rejected US President Donald Trump, saying they do not want to be bought by America, according to an opinion poll.\n\nThe first survey of Greenlanders since Trump renewed his interest in buying the Arctic island found that 85 per cent did not want to leave the Kingdom of Denmark and become part of the US.\n\nJust 6 per cent said they wanted to join the US, while 9 per cent were undecided, in the poll for Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq and Danish daily Berlingske.\n\nThe survey comprised 497 people and was conducted online over the past week by research firm Verian.\n\n\u201cTrump shouldn\u2019t have Greenland.

Exceptionally wet weather the previous winter had led to a rise in vegetation, but an extremely hot summer and a delay to the following rainy season meant the abundant plants were very dry.\n\nThe study found that low rainfall from October to December was about 2.4 times more likely compared with the pre-industrial climate, and fire-prone conditions had extended by about 23 days each year, increasing the chance a fire would start during peak Santa Ana winds.\n\nWater infrastructure, not designed to fight a rapidly expanding wildfire, was unable to keep up with scale and extreme needs, it also noted.\n\nUCLA hydroclimatologist Park Williams flagged the dangers faced by the many neighbourhoods in Southern California nestled in the heavily vegetated mountainsides, from Santa Barbara through Ventura, Orange and San Diego counties.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say that a large number of neighbourhoods are at similar risk to the small number of areas that we saw actually be exposed to the fires this year,\u201d Williams said.\n\nRecent days of moderate rain has helped contain the major fires, although one of the most recent breakout in San Luis Obispo county remained burning across 25 per cent of the area by Thursday this week.\n\nThe study is the third since the fires broke out to find a link between climate change and the disaster. Last month, rapid research from scientists at UCLA said climate change could be blamed for about 25 per cent of the fuel available for the fires.\n\n\u201cPoliticians are talking about mismanagement of the landscape, but that is not the case with these particular fires,\u201d said UCLA\u2019s Williams.\n\nThe researchers said that while the individual results showed some degree of uncertainty, the overall results pointed in the same direction, indicating that climate change caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels had increased the likelihood of the fires.\n\n\u201cWithout a faster transition away from planet-heating fossil fuels, California will continue to get hotter, drier and more flammable,\u201d said Clair Barnes of Imperial College London.\n\nThe findings were not peer reviewed because of the rapid nature of the study, but other scientists backed the findings.\n\n\u201cWWA\u2019s study uses widely employed methods in climate change attribution, considers long-term and immediate causes of the fire, and draws on multiple lines of evidence from weather observations and climate models to buttress their findings,\u201d said Rupert Stuart-Smith, senior researcher in climate science and attribution at Oxford university.\n\n\u201cFires in California are far from unprecedented, but, be it in the extremely dry autumn that created tinderbox conditions, or the fire weather that drove the rapid spread of the flames, the authors find fingerprints of human-caused climate change throughout this event.\u201d", "tag": "us?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fc879ca0-79c5-4a65-86e2-b90abdb0e196"}, {"uuid4": "de5491ef-4975-4dd7-855a-926b6062b8b6", "title": "US chipmaker Nvidia rebounds after historic tumble", "description": "Wall Street steadies following sharp losses driven by concerns over Chinese AI group DeepSeek", "author": "Mari Novik", "published_date": "2025-01-28T21:28:57.909Z", "content": "Nvidia led Wall Street technology stocks higher on Tuesday following a global rout sparked by Chinese start-up DeepSeek\u2019s advances in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite index rose 2 per cent after Monday\u2019s 3.1 per cent decline.

It is not uncommon for a CEO to leave when a big transaction falls apart, but Burritt insists that his final chapter is not written.\n\nAncora may be harsh to fault Burritt for pursuing the deal with Nippon, as if an unprecedented brawl over a buyer from an allied nation was predictable.

With Burritt at the helm, US Steel is pursuing two lawsuits, one over the Washington rejection and another over the union and Cleveland Cliffs\u2019 attempts to scotch the deal. Besides, failure isn\u2019t so bad. A Nippon abandonment would secure a $565mn termination fee for US Steel.\n\nIf the merger proves truly dead, the question of who should run the steelmaker is worth asking. Ancora says Burritt has failed as an operator and describes its candidate to replace him, industry executive Alan Kestenbaum, as a steel-sector \u201clegend\u201d. Such a person would come in handy: US Steel\u2019s current share price is just $36, far below the $55 on offer from Nippon.\n\nThe biggest challenge for Burritt is that, unless he can revive the Nippon deal before its June drop-dead date, he must provide a persuasive vision of how US Steel can thrive on its own. Yet his brokering of the Nippon deal suggests he doesn\u2019t think it can. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if shareholders are ready to give Ancora, which may have its own M&A angle, a hearing.\n\nsujeet.indap@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/68ac9eef-6cc2-481d-bae4-f75e88ce2a0a"}, {"uuid4": "3b1c7951-741d-4bb0-a01a-32f55be9825e", "title": "Mexico and Canada launch flurry of border measures to appease Trump", "description": "Tariff threat spurs Mexico to fill in smuggling tunnel and Canada to deploy helicopters and drones", "author": "Ilya Gridneff", "published_date": "2025-01-28T18:59:59.729Z", "content": "Mexico and Canada have begun a flurry of activity at their US borders to show they are willing to clamp down on migrants ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s deadline to impose punitive tariffs.\n\nIn the Mexican city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez on the US border, workers began filling in a 300 metre tunnel this week used to smuggle migrants into Texas. The 1.8 metre-high tunnel, with electric cabling and ventilation, ran under the R\u00edo Bravo, also known as the Rio Grande, from central Ju\u00e1rez beside a major highway. US agents said they had discovered it earlier this month.\n\nMexico has set up large, air-conditioned temporary shelters for deportees, while President Claudia Sheinbaum said some non-Mexicans were among thousands of migrants that Mexico took back in Trump\u2019s first week. She had earlier suggested her country could accept non-Mexican migrants as an offering to Trump.\n\nCanada deployed newly leased Black Hawk patrol helicopters, extra dogs and 60 drones at its border with the US as part of its response to Trump\u2019s demands that the two countries curb entry of illegal migrants and fentanyl.\n\nCanada\u2019s public safety minister David McGuinty said their effort \u201cinvolves political outreach, official outreach and operational outreach\u201d, including talks this week with Trump\u2019s border tsar Tom Homan.\n\nOfficials in Mexico City and Ottawa rushed to demonstrate action after Trump threatened to impose tariffs of 25 per cent on their exports as early as February 1 if they failed to cut migration and the drugs trade.\n\nIf implemented, the threatened tariffs would send both economies into recession, upend supply chains in industries from cars to electronics, and push up prices for US consumers, analysts have said.\n\nTrump briefly announced punitive tariffs on Colombia last week after it refused to accept two military aircraft carrying deportees, but lifted them when Bogot\u00e1 swiftly backed down.\n\nHe has also declared a national emergency at the US-Mexico border, sent 1,500 additional troops, and cancelled legal-entry pathways created by his predecessor Joe Biden, including an app for asylum applications.\n\nThe measures have left thousands of migrants, including Argenis, a 26-year-old Venezuelan who had hoped to reunite with his brother in Texas, stranded in Mexican border cities.\n\n\u201cVideos came up on TikTok of people hugging their families. I was so excited to hug my family too,\u201d he told the FT.\n\n\u201c[Then] I was depressed. I even deleted my WhatsApp. I didn\u2019t want to speak to anyone.\u201d\n\nTrump put the US southern border at the heart of all three of his presidential campaigns, railing last year against record levels of illegal immigration under Biden.\n\nSheinbaum said on Monday that migration officials from both countries had held several virtual meetings and reached agreements, without offering further detail.\n\nMexico took back about 4,000 migrants in Trump\u2019s first week, an uptick from the roughly 3,700 a week it took back last year, according to government data.\n\nMexico had already been increasing immigration enforcement at the US\u2019s behest for more than a decade. Last year it stepped up checks and detentions further across the country, focusing on busing foreign migrants southwards.\n\nMexico is also under pressure over drug cartels that supply substances including the deadly opioid fentanyl to the US. Curbing that trade is difficult, with combined murders and disappearances in the country close to record highs.\n\nSecurity Minister Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch said on Tuesday that since October more than 10,000 people had been detained for high-impact crimes such as murder and violent robbery, and more than 90 tonnes of drugs seized.\n\nThe situation on Canada\u2019s border with the US differs from Mexico\u2019s. Since June last year, US authorities have found around 100,000 people a month crossing from Mexico irregularly, according to US Customs and Border Protection, but at the northern border with Canada the figure was about 15,000 a month.\n\nCanada has said that only about 1 per cent of fentanyl entering the US is transported across its border. But that has not prevented Trump from threatening it, alongside Mexico. In recent months both Mexico and Canada have announced large drug busts.\n\nCanadian foreign minister M\u00e9lanie Joly, who will travel to Washington DC to meet Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday, said this week she would also speak with Mexico, the UK and EU counterparts.\n\n\u201cAt the heart of my conversations with my British colleagues and my European colleagues is going to be the question of how to respond to tariffs,\u201d she said on Monday.\n\nIn December Canada announced an extra C$1.3bn (US $900mn) to bolster border security and the immigration system. It increased patrols and surveillance along the border, which stretches nearly 9,000km across land and water.\n\nXavi Delgado, of the Canada Institute at the Wilson Centre in Washington DC, said:\u00a0\u201cThis has been a wake-up call for Ottawa. Trump has voiced frustration with Canada over it taking the US for granted.\u201d\n\nMexico and Canada have lobbied lawmakers and others in the president\u2019s circle, arguing that tariffs would be a \u201close-lose\u201d situation for all three countries.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s crackdown, some migrants in Mexico remain hopeful. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of staying here quietly, waiting,\u201d said Gabriel, a 23-year-old from Venezuela, at the border. \u201cI feel that at any moment we\u2019ll be able to cross legally, or something good will happen.\u201d\n\nThis article\u00a0has been amended to make clear that since June last year, US authorities have found around 100,000 people a month crossing irregularly from Mexico and 15,000 from Canada, not illegally as originally stated.", "tag": "us?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/08c8b7cc-add8-49d1-996f-22b3ad2d5847"}, {"uuid4": "7b4b8924-9366-45d0-93b3-92e979000bba", "title": "China sees room to avert trade war with Donald Trump despite tariff threat", "description": "New US president hints at potential agreement linking TikTok ownership with levies", "author": "Zijing Wu", "published_date": "2025-01-22T06:19:43.179Z", "content": "Chinese officials were prepared for Donald Trump to deliver bad news on his return to the US presidency: immediate 60 per cent tariffs on exports that could deal a serious blow to the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nWhat they got instead seemed mild. Trump first ordered an investigation into US-China trade, before on Tuesday reiterating the threat of a 10 per cent tariff related to the deadly opioid fentanyl.\n\nThat was enough to hit China\u2019s stocks and currency. The mainland\u2019s CSI 300 index fell 1 per cent and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng retreated 1.6 per cent on Wednesday, while the offshore renminbi weakened 0.25 per cent.\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s opening moves on China were less severe than the 25 per cent tariffs he announced on US allies Mexico and Canada. He also hinted at a potential broader deal linking tariffs to ownership of TikTok, the Chinese-controlled short-video platform that US security hawks want to shut down.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s tendency for erratic statements and rapid changes of course, this softer than expected prelude has rekindled hope in Beijing that negotiations might be possible to avert a second trade war. Now, the question is what kind of deal would be acceptable to both sides.\n\n\u201cThere is a possibility that the two sides can strike a deal \u2014 you can sense there is cautious optimism,\u201d said Zhao Minghao, professor at the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cBut we will need to see if there is a good match between what Trump and Beijing can offer each other.\u201d\n\nTrump and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping held a phone call the weekend before the inauguration, their first in four years, which the US president described as \u201cvery good\u201d and covered \u201cTrade, Fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects\u201d.\n\nXi also dispatched the most senior Chinese official ever to attend a US inauguration, vice-president Han Zheng, who also met US business leaders including Trump confidant Elon Musk.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump had vowed to hit China with 60 per cent tariffs upon taking office, and later threatened an additional 10 per cent on day one to compel Beijing to crack down on flows of precursor drugs for fentanyl.\n\nInstead, on Monday he issued a memo directing officials to investigate the US trade deficit and \u201crecommend appropriate measures, such as a global supplemental tariff or other policies, to remedy such deficits\u201d.\n\nHe also asked the US Trade Representative to study Beijing\u2019s compliance with the \u201cphase one\u201d deal agreed during his first term as president, and to consider additional tariffs \u201cparticularly with respect to industrial supply chains and circumvention through third countries\u201d \u2014 a move with potentially much further-reaching implications for China.\n\nEconomists believe part of China\u2019s trade with the US has been diverted through third countries to avoid tariffs since the trade war of Trump\u2019s first administration. The US officials are due to report their findings on April 1.\n\nAlthough Trump signed an order allowing TikTok to operate for 75 days \u2014 a turnaround from his first term, where he had sought to ban it from the US \u2014 he also said Beijing would need to allow a US entity to take half of the company or face tariffs of up to 100 per cent.\n\nThe linking of tariffs to TikTok\u2019s ownership followed quixotic remarks on Monday by Musk, who complained that while the former was allowed to operate in the US, his social media site X was blocked in China.\n\nOne person familiar with the matter in China said Beijing might agree to TikTok\u2019s owner ByteDance selling the platform as part of a broader deal that would cover a range of issues including trade. However, any such discussions were at an early stage, the person said.\n\nChinese officials, who have long opposed a forced sale of TikTok and would need to approve it, have in recent days appeared to signal a more hands-off approach.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to actions such as the operation and acquisition of businesses, we believe it should be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles,\u201d the foreign ministry said on Tuesday, adding that \u201cChina\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed\u201d.\n\nGabriel Wildau, managing director at consultancy Teneo, wrote in an analyst note that Chinese leaders might \u201cbelieve that an amicable resolution of the TikTok issue could lay groundwork for co-operation\u201d on other issues.\n\n\u201cThese could include tariffs, export controls, and \u2014 in a dream scenario for Beijing \u2014 even US policy towards Taiwan and the South China Sea,\u201d Wildau said.\n\nHowever, economists warned that it was too early to be confident that trade conflict could be averted. While Trump sounded more open to dealmaking, his administration was filled with China hawks, they said.\n\n\u201cThis is more of a holding pattern for now,\u201d said Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC. \u201cIt is somewhat encouraging that we didn\u2019t see an immediate rise and tariffs and that maybe there is some room for discussions beforehand. But I think it would be the wrong conclusion to say that China is now entirely off the hook.\u201d\n\nAside from trade, Beijing could offer Trump help on other issues, such as resolving the Ukraine war, said Wang Chong, a foreign policy expert at Zhejiang International Studies University.\n\nWang warned, however, that Beijing was ready if relations broke down. Even if the US started with small tariff increases, it would undermine investor confidence in China.\u00a0\u201cIf tariffs are imposed, China should fight,\u201d Wang said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Arjun Neil Alim in Hong Kong", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ee0718ce-99c0-465c-9466-a435268aebf7"}, {"uuid4": "18a93648-9e83-42fa-a689-2d372a43c8e6", "title": "How the EU could help stem the flow of illegal product imports", "description": "Also in this newsletter: Is sabotage behind Italy\u2019s recent train disruptions?", "author": "Andy Bounds", "published_date": "2025-01-22T06:00:25.009Z", "content": "Good morning. Upon arriving at the White House, Donald Trump signed orders to review \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d, but did not slap any new tariffs yet on his trade partners. Here are five takeaways from his opening salvo, and what it could mean for the EU.\n\nToday, our trade correspondent outlines how the new EU justice commissioner wants to protect consumers from buying dangerous goods. And our Rome reporter has a dispatch on the recent train chaos in Italy that may or may not have been caused by sabotage.\n\nBrussels should get the powers to stem the flood of dangerous goods sent to Europe in small parcels from China, EU justice commissioner Michael McGrath tells Andy Bounds.\n\nContext: Some 10mn items are flown into the EU every day, most of them coming from China. The European Commission has previously launched investigations into Chinese retailers such as Temu over the alleged sale of illegal goods.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with the Financial Times, McGrath said the number of items that are faulty or do not meet safety standards was \u201can issue of major concern\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority originates from China, and the surveys and the analysis that has been done shows a very high level of non-compliance with EU safety standards,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt also affects European companies because it undermines the level playing field\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and impacts on the ability of European companies to compete,\u201d McGrath said.\n\nThe commission is preparing a paper on ecommerce for next month that will recommend tighter customs controls, among other measures. But McGrath believes member states are struggling to keep up with the rising demand, despite increased collaboration between them.\n\n\u201cIt is an area where I believe there is a need for a centralised EU action,\u201d said the Irish politician.\n\nWhile new rules that allow national authorities to block certain websites are helping, McGrath wants to examine \u201ccentralised investigative and enforcement powers at an EU level\u201d.\n\nMcGrath, who is also responsible for upholding democracy and EU values, also insisted that EU regulations of large online platforms were not \u201cabout censorship\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is about ensuring that where there is illegal content, such as illegal hate speech, that that is removed,\u201d he added.\n\nMcGrath defended the relatively slow pace of investigations into platforms including X and TikTok over how they handle content and potentially influence users.\n\n\u201cThe EU can only act on the basis of evidence,\u201d he said, and companies must have \u201ca fair opportunity to respond, to address the concerns that have been raised\u201d.\n\nThe commission also wanted to be confident that a fine or other punishment could survive a challenge at the European Court of Justice. \u201cWe\u2019re very anxious to avoid the damage that could be done by adverse findings before the ECJ,\u201d he said.\n\nMcGrath added that more legislation might be needed to protect free and fair elections, with a crucial poll in Germany next month.\n\nThe change of guard in Brussels is helping fuel a debate on whether the EU needs to reassess its merger rules to better support industrial policy.\n\nItaly\u2019s transport minister Matteo Salvini has warned about sabotage to the country\u2019s railways as recent disruptions have paralysed the country, writes Giuliana Ricozzi.\n\nContext: Earlier this month, a faulty power line at Milan\u2019s central station resulted in dozens of train cancellations and hours of delays. Since then, similar malfunctions have occurred around the peninsula, igniting a debate on the railways\u2019 conditions, and the responsibility for the disruptions.\n\nLast week, Ferrovie dello Stato, the state company in charge of rail infrastructure, formally requested prosecutors in Rome to investigate what it described as \u201cabnormal incidents\u2019\u2019 and \u201chighly suspicious events\u2019\u2019, adding that the faults could be part of a deliberate sabotage campaign.\n\nSalvini, who is in charge of transport as well as deputy prime minister, has come under fire for the disruption, with opponents calling for his resignation.\n\nSpeaking in parliament yesterday, Salvini echoed the warnings of sabotage, saying the \u201csituation was objectively worrying\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u201cItaly is not and will never be intimidated,\u201d Salvini said, adding that \u201cfor years the railway network has unfortunately been under attack\u201d.\n\nBut opposition parties and unions have shown scepticism at the sabotage theory, rather pointing at frequent technical issues on the network and their mismanagement.\n\nThe countless disruptions and delays come as Italy\u2019s old fashioned railway system is undergoing a big modernisation process with 1,200 open construction sites across the country.", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/18723c71-2749-443d-9983-c35ffdf08ef0"}, {"uuid4": "66deb6a7-3f68-4a6d-9073-51e9b96d0a38", "title": "Banks compete for Hong Kong\u2019s blockbuster listing with 0.01% fees", "description": "Chinese lenders\u2019 ultra-low pitches for CATL secondary offering reflect scarcity of business on mainland ", "author": "Arjun Neil Alim", "published_date": "2025-01-22T05:00:25.870Z", "content": "Chinese banks have been pitching to work on the blockbuster Hong Kong secondary listing of the world\u2019s leading EV battery maker CATL for as little as 0.01 per cent in fees, highlighting cut-throat competition in a once-lucrative listings market where business has significantly slowed.\n\nCICC and CSC are among the banks lined up for a leading role on the deal, which stands to be one of the biggest listings in Hong Kong in recent years. JPMorgan and Bank of America are also lined up for top roles.\n\nTwo people with knowledge of the matter said CICC\u2019s pitch for a role on the deal had suggested they would be willing to work on it for fees of 0.01 per cent of the capital raised, which could ultimately top $7bn. Two people with knowledge of the matter said CSC had also pitched for a fee at around that level.\n\n\u201cI think in this market, competitors are willing to do things for almost nothing,\u201d said a senior banker at an institution that pitched for a role.\n\nCompanies typically use the numbers from several banks\u2019 pitches as a guideline when deciding how to set fees, rather than directly paying them the amount they pitched. The total fee pool can be shared unevenly between the banks.\n\nCATL was planning to pay 0.2 per cent in underwriting fees, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Incentive fees on top of this \u2014 based partly on the value of the orders that each bank brings in \u2014 could make the final number higher, two people briefed on the deal said. Fees on large deals such as CATL\u2019s listing can often be lower than on smaller ones, but figures below 1 per cent are unusual.\n\nMorgan Stanley has estimated the CATL listing could raise up to $7.7bn, marking one of the biggest offerings in the territory in recent years and giving the Shenzhen-listed company access to offshore funds as it seeks to expand overseas. CATL announced its plans in December, with the listing expected later this year.\n\nBankers said Chinese banks were willing to accept rock-bottom fees on such a major offering as there was little business and the IPO market was yet to recover on the mainland. A director at a European bank who pitched said it was not a surprise to see the cut-throat pitches \u201cgiven most of their China team onshore has lots of capacity but no deal flows\u201d.\n\nUS banks are planning to work on the deal despite the Pentagon this month adding CATL \u2014 a supplier to Tesla, Volkswagen and Ford \u2014 to a blacklist of companies that it says are linked to China\u2019s military.\n\nInterest among some US institutional investors for an allocation has also not wavered, according to bankers involved. The defence department\u2019s list only prevents those named doing business with the US military and has no direct legal ramifications, but it brings reputational risk.\n\nCATL said in a statement it had \u201cnever engaged in any military-related business or activities\u201d, the move was a \u201cmistake\u201d and was \u201cexpected to have no substantially adverse impact on our business\u201d.\n\nThe battery pioneer shelved a previous plan to sell up to $5bn in Swiss global depositary receipts in 2023 following regulatory concerns over large-scale offerings.\n\nOn average, banks would pitch for or receive at least a single-digit fee on a Hong Kong listing, according to investment bankers and prospectuses filed to the exchange in 2024.\n\nAn executive at another bank that pitched for a role described the CATL listing as a \u201cfranchise-defining deal\u201d and said bankers would want to be involved despite the low fees.\n\nBanks also have an incentive to be in on the deal in the hope of future business with CATL, such as block trades that could be more lucrative.\n\n\u201cEveryone just wants credits on the league table, they\u2019re not trying to make money on this deal,\u201d said one senior Chinese banker familiar with the pitch. \u201cIt\u2019s very annoying to see some peers sabotaging the norms, but there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201d\n\nBank of America, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and CICC declined to comment.

The group also plans to invest about $6.8bn overseas to build up its foundation model training capabilities using advanced Nvidia chips.\n\nAbout 60 per cent of ByteDance\u2019s domestic semiconductor orders would go to Chinese suppliers such as Huawei and Cambricon, while the rest would be spent on Nvidia chips that have been watered down to align with US export controls, the people said.\n\nBeijing has given Chinese tech companies informal guidance to buy at least 30 per cent of their chips from the country\u2019s own suppliers, the people added.\n\nThe $6.8bn in overseas investment was budgeted to build out ByteDance\u2019s AI computing capacity for model training. This investment could face challenges from recently expanded US export controls designed to hamper Chinese companies building sensitive technologies.\n\nThe push comes as ByteDance faces pressure in its core social media business. TikTok restored service to 170mn US users on Sunday after new President Donald Trump said companies that distributed and hosted the platform would not be held liable for violating a US law that banned the video app unless it was sold.\n\nWhile Trump signed an executive order on Monday to keep TikTok open for 75 days, he said he wanted a US company to have 50 per cent ownership in the video app in the future. The president said he could \u201ccertainly\u201d put tariffs on China if it rejected a deal.\n\nAny such transaction could affect plans for a future ByteDance initial public offering, with the company valuing itself at $300bn during a recent share buyback programme.\n\nThe company drew up its huge purchasing budget for graphic processing units in 2025 before the recent interventions in the US.\n\nByteDance, which under the direction of the tech group\u2019s founder Zhang Yiming has become the frontrunner in China\u2019s AI race, is doubling down to build out its own AI infrastructure to train its foundation model, as well as to implement AI functions across its various platforms.\n\nIt has built up computing capacity in south-east Asia, particularly in Malaysia. Though Chinese companies have been banned from purchasing Nvidia chips outside of the US since 2023, they have been able to secure access to chips through rental agreements with third-party data centre providers, several industry insiders said.\n\nThis loophole was closed last week by Joe Biden\u2019s administration, which issued new rules that the identity of both the owner and operator of the chips must undergo a review process.\n\nWhile Trump could take a different stance on export controls, the regulations \u2014 if strictly implemented \u2014 would make ByteDance\u2019s chip purchases overseas more difficult than ever.\n\nIt has made large orders to build up overseas AI capacity this year, such as through rental agreements, one of the people said. It should be sufficient for most of the company\u2019s needs in 2025 but what happened after that remained uncertain, the person added.\n\nByteDance\u2019s budget for purchases of AI chips overseas was previously reported by news outlet The Information. In response to the FT\u2019s reporting, ByteDance said: \u201cThe anonymously sourced information about our plan is incorrect.\u201d\n\nByteDance also faces challenges from deep-pocketed local competitors, such as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, which are investing heavily in generative AI. Alongside these rivals, it has been pushing out more capable models and lowering costs for developers.\n\nChinese companies still need to build up the capacity of AI data centres onshore to support the use of AI applications even after the models have been trained.\n\nByteDance plans to use most of its Chinese AI chips \u2014 including Huawei\u2019s Ascend and Cambricon \u2014 for \u201cinference\u201d tasks, the computation undertaken by large language models to generate a response to a prompt.\n\nByteDance released its AI chatbot Doubao in August 2023 and the AI app has become China\u2019s most popular AI application, according to website analytics site Aicpb.com.\n\nDoubao, which means \u201cbeanbag\u201d in Chinese, had 71mn regular monthly active users as of December, compared with OpenAI\u2019s 300mn weekly active users globally.\n\nNvidia recorded $11.6bn in revenue from China, including Hong Kong, or about 13 per cent of its global total, during the first three quarters of 2024, according to company filings.\n\nByteDance is by far the largest client for Nvidia in China. The TikTok parent can only buy less advanced chips such as Nvidia\u2019s H20 for Chinese data centres, a specialised and less-powerful version of its GPUs tailored to align with US export controls.\n\nIn 2024, it ordered about 230,000 of Nvidia\u2019s chips, mostly H20s, according to estimates from tech consultancy Omdia. This compares with 485,000 of the more advanced \u201cHopper\u201d chips bought by Microsoft last year and the 224,000 acquired by Meta.\n\nTech companies around the world have spent an estimated $229bn on servers in 2024, according to Omdia, led by Microsoft\u2019s $31bn in capital expenditure and Amazon\u2019s $26bn.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ryan McMorrow in Beijing and Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0815c8fb-e6ed-478b-abb1-c67d6f48fd3a"}, {"uuid4": "f2711553-608c-41ad-8307-cea0440b7d85", "title": "Five takeaways on Donald Trump\u2019s opening trade salvo ", "description": "President vows to correct \u2018unfair practices\u2019 as US trading partners prepare for an era of tariffs ", "author": "Alan Smith", "published_date": "2025-01-21T20:25:02.325Z", "content": "Donald Trump imposed no new trade tariffs on the first day of his second term, as feared by markets, but the US president did lay out the official blueprint for an \u201cAmerica First Trade Policy\u201d.\n\nA presidential memo called on federal agencies to remediate \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d and identify \u201ccurrency manipulators\u201d. Trade pacts with China, Canada, Mexico and all other partners were placed under review.\n\nThe message: the Trump administration was ready to use all means to re-engineer trade flows to its advantage. Here are five takeaways from the opening salvos of Trump\u2019s trade agenda.\n\nTrump mentioned tariffs just three times in his inaugural address, calming investors and trade partners who had been warned to expect \u201cday one\u201d levies. But he did outline plans to set up an External Revenue Service to collect tariffs, indicating serious plans to increase revenues from trade.\n\nJosh Lipsky, a senior director at the Atlantic Council think-tank, said tariff decisions are likely to be delayed, but not abandoned. \u201cThe president was worried about the market reaction on Tuesday and he didn\u2019t want it to mar his first day.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d memo provided a framework for the new agenda, announcing reviews into unfair trade practices, the reasons for US trade deficits and whether competitors are manipulating currencies and unfairly taxing US business.\n\nTrump also sharpened his rhetoric and repeated threats to apply 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, despite the countries\u2019 free trade pact. When asked about the prospect of imposing universal tariffs on anybody doing business with the US, the president said: \u201cWe may. But we\u2019re not ready for that yet.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday Trump also reiterated a campaign threat to impose a 10 per cent tariff on China as a means of punishing Beijing for the flow of Fentanyl to Mexico and Canada. He said this could happen on February 1.\n\n\u201cThe experience of the first term is to expect tariffs sooner rather than later,\u201d Lipsky warned, adding the administration did not have a full economic team in place and wanted to establish solid legal bases for any moves.\n\nTrump appears to be prioritising actions on the US\u2019s nearest trading partners, saying he was preparing tariffs on Canada and Mexico to be applied as soon as February 1.\n\nTrump had no qualms in hitting US allies in his first term, invoking national security concerns to put tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. But by going so publicly for Canada, analysts say he is signalling that no country is safe from the self-declared \u201ctariff man\u201d.\n\nThe president\u2019s trade memo ordered a review of trade ties with Canada and Mexico by April 1 (a later date from Trump\u2019s tariff warning, which he did not explain). Preparations would then begin for a comprehensive review of the USMCA trade deal in July 2026.\n\nOne priority highlighted in the trade memo is Trump\u2019s determination to cut \u201cunlawful migration and fentanyl flows\u201d, particularly from Mexico and Canada.\n\nMany supply chains for US manufacturers, particularly carmakers, rely on operations in all three countries and those businesses could put pressure on Trump to rescind his threats.\n\nOn Tuesday Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country was taking Trump\u2019s proposals \u201cseriously\u201d and would respond if tariffs were imposed, while Mexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum said it would focus on the \u201cdecrees rather than the discourse\u201d.\n\nOther parts of the president\u2019s policy cover the means to enable a comprehensive shift in Washington\u2019s dealings with its trade partners.\n\n\u201cI am not expecting tweaks on the margins,\u201d said Kelly Ann Shaw, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells and a former Trump trade adviser. \u201cBut rather a review of the entire panoply of trade and economic tools that results in significant action.\u201d\n\nThe broad range of initiatives kick-started by the memo include a probe into currency manipulation. Trump has previously accused China of undervaluing the renminbi to boost the value of its exports.\n\nThe president also directed his trade representative, Jamieson Greer, to review US trade deals, including the limited one struck during the first Trump administration that was intended to boost exports to China.\n\nSeveral sections of the memo direct various US economic officials to probe Washington\u2019s economic relations with Beijing more broadly, including a review of existing tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nGreer has also been asked to identify possible new deals with significant market access for \u201cAmerican workers, farmers, ranchers, service providers and other businesses\u201d, indicating the second Trump administration may be open to forging new trade agreements.\n\n\u201cThis is a pretty huge deal. It makes me think at some point there is going to be a trade bill in Congress,\u201d said Everett Eissenstat, a partner at Washington law firm Squire Patton Boggs. \u201cOnce trade bills start moving they tend to be very significant and the statutes don\u2019t change that often.\u201d\n\nTrump has linked tariffs to other policy goals, beyond reducing trade deficits.\n\nHe has promised duties on EU products unless the bloc\u2019s members buy more American oil and gas. Trump on Monday also suggested tariffs on China could hinge on a deal over TikTok\u2019s ownership. He said he would apply levies on Chinese imports of up to 100 per cent if Beijing failed to agree on a deal to sell at least 50 per cent of the app to a US company.\n\nAnahita Thoms, head of international trade for law firm Baker McKenzie in Germany, said Trump was using tariff threats to maximise his leverage.\n\n\u201cI do not think he is bluffing but he is using it as a negotiating tool,\u201d she said. Now \u201ceach country will know what concession it will have to make to be on good terms\u201d.\n\nThe threats risked collateral damage. \u201cTariffs would be inflationary,\u201d said Thoms, adding Trump would not \u201cwant to do something that has a negative impact on inflation\u201d.\n\nUS imports from countries such as Vietnam and Mexico picked up in Trump\u2019s first term. This reflected the trend of Chinese manufacturers seeking to bypass US tariffs by exporting to America via third countries.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade team have realised this. His memo calls on Greer to consider additional tariff modifications to address \u201ccircumvention through third countries\u201d.\n\nThe memo asks officials to look at whether a \u201cglobal supplemental tariff\u201d could be used to remedy the \u201clarge and persistent\u201d annual US trade deficit. That indicates that something similar to the universal tariff promised by Trump on the campaign trail might still emerge.\n\nHis threats could also stimulate other countries to increase trade with each other. Just since December, the EU has clinched agreements with the Mercosur group of South American countries and Mexico while restarting talks with Malaysia after more than a decade.\n\nSpeaking to the Financial Times, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said the global trading system would survive the \u201cinitial shock\u201d of Trump\u2019s trade barriers.", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2140794a-0137-407e-b187-86ea9b3db939"}, {"uuid4": "62490f42-8b98-4454-a1c4-40f0b2c70788", "title": "Taiwan lawmakers risk alienating Donald Trump with defence funds freeze", "description": "US president has claimed Washington is providing \u2018insurance\u2019 for Taipei", "author": "Kathrin Hille", "published_date": "2025-01-21T09:29:39.295Z", "content": "Taiwan\u2019s parliament has frozen critical parts of the 2025 defence budget, heightening the risk that the country alienates US President Donald Trump just at the moment that it needs firm US support against security threats from China.\n\nTaipei has been eager to demonstrate to the incoming US administration that it is stepping up efforts to strengthen its defences. Trump claimed in July that Taiwan \u201cdoesn\u2019t give us anything\u201d and compared the US to \u201can insurance company\u201d for the island nation\u2019s security.\n\nBut just hours after Trump was inaugurated to a second term on Monday, Taiwan\u2019s opposition-controlled legislature voted to freeze half the country\u2019s budget for its submarine programme, 30 per cent of the military\u2019s operations expenditure and one-third of the funding for a drone industry park. It also cut 60 per cent of the defence ministry\u2019s publicity budget.\n\nTaiwanese government officials and ruling party lawmakers accused the Kuomintang, the largest opposition party, of helping China by undermining President Lai Ching-te\u2019s minority government.\n\nBlocking parts of the defence budget \u201cshows the world that Taiwan\u2019s determination to defend itself has been significantly compromised\u201d, premier Cho Jung-tai told reporters.\n\nPo Horng-huei, vice-minister of defence, said that the freeze on the operations budget would impede the military\u2019s daily efforts to counter \u201cgrey zone\u201d provocations from China, while the drone funding restrictions would set Taiwan further back in an area where it already \u201clags far behind\u201d the People\u2019s Liberation Army, and that has become a crucial weapons category since the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe slashing of the publicity budget would hinder efforts to fight Chinese cognitive warfare, he added.\n\n\u201cOur defence will move backwards this year,\u201d Po said.\n\nThe draft budget submitted by Lai\u2019s government in August included NT$647bn (US$20bn) in defence spending. While that was a 7.7 per cent increase over the 2024 budget, it amounts to only 2.45 per cent of GDP, down from 2.5 per cent last year and short of the 3 per cent target US officials and defence experts have urged for Taiwan.\n\nElbridge Colby, Trump\u2019s nominee for under-secretary of defence for policy, has repeatedly criticised Taiwan over its \u201cmeagre\u201d defence spending, and has suggested US support would be moot unless Taipei strengthened its defences against the threat from China.\n\nBeijing claims Taiwan as part of its territory and threatens to annex it by force if Taipei refuses unification indefinitely. Over the past few years, it has stepped up military operations around Taiwan.\n\nCounter to Trump\u2019s claims, Taipei is one of the largest paying customers for US defence companies.\n\nBut Washington maintains a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d on whether it would come to Taiwan\u2019s defence. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the US considers any effort to determine Taiwan\u2019s future by non-peaceful means as of grave concern to the US, and commits to providing Taiwan with defensive weapons and to maintaining its own capacity to resist coercion that would jeopardise Taiwan\u2019s security.\n\nFormer president Joe Biden said on multiple occasions that the US would deploy forces to defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, but Trump has said it would be \u201cvery, very difficult\u201d to do so.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s military will be able to access the frozen funds only if parliament agrees to unblock them following a report from the defence ministry at a plenary session.\n\nAlthough the KMT advocates for closer ties across the Taiwan Strait, it denies being pro-Beijing and has previously pledged to support increased defence spending.\n\nBut opposition lawmakers attacked government spending plans as \u201cwasteful\u201d, echoing some voters\u2019 criticism about the ruling party.", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/105ed24f-30e3-41ac-b5b1-0efeb4e3a625"}, {"uuid4": "d649ce63-e7ef-44ec-b744-9c2ec2d5eabb", "title": "US share of global foreign direct investment surges to record", "description": "\u2018Exceptionalism\u2019 of world\u2019s biggest economy expected to continue as strong domestic demand drives inward flows", "author": "Valentina Romei", "published_date": "2025-01-21T05:00:21.705Z", "content": "The US share of global cross-border investment projects has soared to its highest level on record, underscoring the country\u2019s stronger economic momentum than Europe or China as Donald Trump starts his second term in the Oval Office.\n\nThe figures for announced greenfield projects \u2014 where companies build or expand new facilities and operations in a foreign country \u2014 come as political and business leaders gather in Davos to debate how the Trump presidency might reshape the global economic order through steep tariffs and reshored production.\n\nThe proportion of new FDI projects announced in the US rose from 11.6 per cent in 2023, to 14.3 per cent in the 12 months to November 2024, according to the Financial Times\u2019 analysis of data collected by fDI Markets, an FT-owned company that has tracked cross-border investments from 2003.\n\nThe increase has been driven by buoyant consumer demand and government incentives in the world\u2019s largest economy, according to economists.\n\n\u201cThe US is pulling in more and more global investment projects and this reflects the strong demand outlook and much stronger productivity growth than elsewhere,\u201d said Innes McFee, global economist at Oxford Economics.\n\n\u201cWe expect that US exceptionalism to continue,\u201d he said, adding that while the Trump policies were creating uncertainty, a looser budget would drive demand and \u201cadd to reasons for investing in the US in the short term.

The president did not immediately impose higher import levies in the executive orders he issued during his inauguration on Monday.\n\nThe US attracted more than 2,100 new FDI greenfield projects in the 12 months to November, preliminary 2024 data showed. By contrast, China secured just under 400 projects, close to a record low and a fraction of the 1,000 plus investments received each year in the decade up to the mid-2010s.\n\nNew projects in Germany plunged to 470 in the 12 months to November 2024, the lowest figure in 18 years in Europe\u2019s largest economy and a big decline from 1,100 greenfield investments a year earlier.\n\nNathan Sheets, chief economist at US bank Citi, said the American surge was partly because of the country\u2019s importance as a hub for AI innovation, lower energy costs and investment incentives as part of the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act and the Chips Act.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s share of inward FDI has fallen due to \u201cgeopolitics\u201d, Sheets said, referring to the west\u2019s attempts to \u201cde-risk\u201d from China.\n\nEurope\u2019s share has fallen even more sharply. Energy prices surged on the continent following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. \u201cCheap energy is attractive to investors,\u201d said Sheets.\n\nThe estimated value of new greenfield FDI projects in the US announced in the 12 months to November 2024 rose by more than $100bn to $227bn, according to fDi. The data is based on corporate\u00a0announcements, press reports and fDI estimates for the lifetime of the project, rather than annual capital spending.\n\nThe rise in US greenfield investment is spread across several sectors. Record 12-month totals were recorded for semiconductor projects \u2014 which have benefited from the Chips Act\u2019s grants and credits \u2014 and in industrial equipment, construction, electronic components, renewable energy and aerospace.\n\nUS growth is forecast to continue outpacing the rates in other advanced nations, according to IMF figures released last week. The US is now expected to grow by 2.7 per cent in 2025, compared with an expansion of just 1 per cent in the Eurozone.\n\nThe shifting geopolitical landscape, with rising trade tensions between the US and China, is contributing to recent FDI trends as multinationals try to hedge supply chain risks.\n\n\u201cGlobal trade is more fragmented and securing supply chains becomes the name of the game,\u201d said Samy Chaar, chief economist at Lombard Odier. \u201cThis means a trend towards friendshoring for goods you do not intend to produce and reshoring for strategic industries such as microchips and healthcare.\u201d\n\nSixty-two per cent of FDI projects in the US last year were from western Europe, up from an average of 58 per cent in the 10 years to 2019, the last year before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn contrast with the inward FDI surge, the number of overseas projects from the US shrank to 2,600 in the 12 months to November, the lowest in two decades, excluding the height of the pandemic. The Biden administration\u2019s industrial policies have incentivised US companies to keep production in the country, experts said.\n\nWhile uncertainty over Trump\u2019s trade and taxation plans has hung over big corporations since November\u2019s election, economists do not expect his agenda to deter projects in the short term.\n\nTrump\u2019s election \u201cdoesn\u2019t change the investment incentives and the economic picture\u201d for investors, said Richard Bolwijn, head of investment research at UN trade body Unctad\u2019s investment and enterprise division. \u201cFrom that perspective, the attractiveness of the US for world investment will continue to go up.\u201d", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/38c1687a-dba5-4442-a7e6-5ec0e0b0ac5b"}, {"uuid4": "4c3f0b23-11d8-4b67-900d-70dc800b109e", "title": "Donald Trump says China tariffs could hinge on TikTok deal", "description": "President signs executive order giving popular video app\u2019s owner 75 days to find US buyer", "author": "Hannah Murphy", "published_date": "2025-01-21T04:27:32.320Z", "content": "President Donald Trump has said that tariffs on China could hinge on a deal over TikTok\u2019s ownership, as he signed an executive order to keep the popular short-form video platform online in the US for 75 days.\n\nWithin hours of his inauguration on Monday, Trump postponed a deadline requiring TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell its stake in the app or face a ban in the country.\n\nTrump said the US \u201cshould be entitled to get half of TikTok\u201d if the app continued operating beyond that cut-off and that he could \u201ccertainly\u201d put tariffs on China if it rejected a deal, which he said would be a \u201chostile act\u201d.\n\nHe said the tariffs could be as high as 100 per cent. \u201cUltimately [Beijing] would approve it because we\u2019d put tariffs on China,\u201d Trump said on signing the order. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I would, but you certainly could do that.\u201d\n\nChina was one of three countries Trump threatened to hit with tariffs on his first day in office. On Monday, he said he could impose levies of 25 per cent on Canada and Mexico from February 1.\n\nBut he did not enact sweeping 60 per cent levies on Chinese imports as he had promised during the campaign, in what would have marked a new stage in the trade war with Beijing during his first term.\n\nThe move to hold off on tariffs against China appeared to offer a bargaining chip for a TikTok deal. Trump spoke to Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday and said he had raised the TikTok issue, although Beijing did not confirm the discussion.\n\nTikTok became temporarily unavailable for about 170mn US users at midnight on Sunday following the initial deadline under the \u201cdivest or ban\u201d law, but it resumed service hours later.\n\nThe executive order said companies that distribute and host TikTok \u2014 which include Apple and Google as well as cloud provider Oracle \u2014 would not be held liable for violating the law during the 75-day extension. Under the law, service providers risked fines of $5,000 per user.\n\nBut Tom Cotton, Republican head of the Senate intelligence committee, warned the companies on Sunday that they risked \u201cruinous bankruptcy\u201d by violating the law.\n\nTikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew had gone on a charm offensive after Trump had indicated during his campaign that he hoped to \u201csave\u201d the app.\n\nChew attended the inauguration alongside tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg and was seated beside Tulsi Gabbard, Trump\u2019s nominee for director of national intelligence, drawing criticism from some observers.\n\nMany US politicians and security officials believe China\u2019s government could use TikTok to access Americans\u2019 personal information, which could facilitate espionage, and wield the app\u2019s algorithm to spread propaganda. TikTok denies that Beijing has any control over the app.\n\nTikTok has also said that divestment was not technologically feasible within the law\u2019s timeframe. Beijing has indicated that it opposed a sale.\n\nNevertheless, Trump suggested that if the app was to continue operating, the US should be paid \u201chalf of the value of TikTok\u201d, adding: \u201cIf I don\u2019t do the deal it\u2019s worthless.

Europe imports most of its magnesite from China, which controls two-thirds of global production.\n\n\u201cWe have enough magnesite in Europe that we could secure supply to the European heavy industries,\u201d Borgas said, adding that EU critical materials designation was helping to boost investment in the mining and processing of lithium, nickel and other metals where China also dominated supply.\n\n\u201cFor sure it gives a boost to the European production of these materials,\u201d Borgas said. \u201cWe have natural resources [but] Europe has neglected its mining capabilities over the last 50 years.\u201d\n\nThe call by Vienna-based RHI Magnesita is a sign of how far China\u2019s global surge in industrial exports in response to faltering domestic demand is extending beyond steel and other widely used metals to lesser known but equally critical materials.\n\nThe company, which has a listed subsidiary in India and a market value of about \u00a31.5bn, is battling falling prices for refractories as Chinese producers turn to exports to absorb excess capacity. Factories in India are also investing in new refractory production as the country pursues its steelmaking ambitions.\n\nIn an effort to boost its supplies of the commodities required to make clean technologies such as batteries and wind turbines, the EU has listed 16 products including nickel, lithium and cobalt as \u201cstrategic\u201d as part of a Critical Raw Materials Act that sets targets for their domestic extraction, processing and recycling.\n\nBorgas argued that magnesite should be added to this list because it also underpinned the processing and recycling of more than half of these \u201cstrategic\u201d minerals.\n\nHe said that including it on the list would also help companies cluster together to invest in decarbonising high-emitting processes. The production of one tonne of magnesia from magnesite emitted about 1.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide, Borgas said.\n\n\u201cBeing on the strategic raw material list helps to support investment in totally new technologies.

The Chinese tech giant is betting that inference will be a bigger future source of demand if the pace of model training slows and AI applications such as chatbots become more widespread.\n\n\u201cTraining is important, but it only occurs a few times,\u201d said Georgios Zacharopoulos, a senior AI researcher working on inference acceleration at Huawei\u2019s Zurich lab. \u201cHuawei is mostly focused on inference, which ultimately will serve more customers.\u201d\n\nIt is focused on the technically less challenging but potentially lucrative path of retrofitting AI models trained on Nvidia products to run on Ascend chips, according to company employees and Ascend customers. Since Nvidia GPUs and Ascend operate on different software, Huawei is helping companies use another software tool to make the two systems compatible.\n\nHuawei\u2019s push comes with top-down government support. Chinese officials have urged local tech giants to buy more of Huawei\u2019s AI chips and shift away from Nvidia.\n\nOne person familiar with Nvidia\u2019s operations in China said Huawei was seen internally as the most serious competitor in the country, adding that its chip design capability was \u201cadvanced\u201d.\n\nWashington has sought to curb Beijing\u2019s development of AI with export controls aimed at hampering the development of sensitive technologies in China. Unlike their US rivals such as OpenAI and Google, companies are unable to access the most cutting-edge GPUs in China. But even though Chinese groups are only able to acquire Nvidia\u2019s less-powerful H20 chips, which are tailored to meet export controls, the GPUs remain in high demand as they are considered better than local alternatives.\n\nAnalysts and\u00a0Huawei researchers\u00a0said Ascend was not yet ready to replace Nvidia for model training because of technical issues, such as a breakdown in the ways the chips interact with each other inside a wider \u201ccluster\u201d of AI chips when training ever larger models.\u201cWhile the Ascend chips perform well on a per-chip basis, there is a bottleneck with the inter-chip connectivity,\u201d said Lin Qingyuan, Bernstein\u2019s China semiconductor analyst. \u201cWhen training a big model, you must break it into smaller tasks. If one chip fails, the software needs to figure out a way for the other chips to take over without delay.\u201d\n\nThe other challenge for Huawei is convincing developers to switch from Nvidia\u2019s Cuda software, renowned as the company\u2019s \u201csecret sauce\u201d for being easy to use for developers and capable of vastly accelerating data processing.\n\nBut Huawei\u2019s soon-to-be-released and updated version of its AI chip, the Ascend 910C, is also expected to address these concerns. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting this new generation of hardware to come with improved software that makes it more accessible for developers,\u201d said a Huawei employee, who declined to be named.\n\nHuawei and Nvidia face stiff competition. Chinese internet group Baidu and chip designer Cambricon have made strides in AI chip development. Meanwhile, in the US, Amazon and Microsoft are also betting they can grab more market share in chips for inference as AI applications become more widespread.\n\nEstimates from SemiAnalysis, a chip consultancy, suggest Nvidia made $12bn on sales in China last year by delivering 1mn of its H20 chips in the country, selling twice as many AI chips as Huawei with its Ascend 910B.\n\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s China-specific H20 GPUs make up the majority of AI chips sold in China. But the lead is narrowing quickly as Huawei increases manufacturing capacity,\u201d said Dylan Patel, chief analyst at SemiAnalysis.\n\nIndustry insiders cautioned that Huawei\u2019s AI chip push was also being constrained by insufficient supply, with two prospective customers telling the Financial Times that they were unable to secure the chips.\n\nHuawei did not respond to a request for comment. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nAnalysts have said that Huawei\u2019s manufacturing is likely to be facing challenges due to US export controls that have left Chinese fabs dependent on outdated chip manufacturing equipment.\n\nThe focus on inference also points to an evolving dynamic in Chinese AI that differs from the US. Washington\u2019s export controls mean Chinese AI players are not engaged in the same race as Silicon Valley rivals Meta, Elon Musk\u2019s x.AI and OpenAI to build large mega-clusters of Nvidia\u2019s most advanced GPUs.\n\n\u201cChinese companies are playing a different game. They are paying much more attention to inference than the US because it is possible to make big efficiency gains even with less powerful chips, which also means they can achieve commercialisation faster,\u201d said Bernstein analyst Lin.\n\nChinese companies were betting they could stay competitive on AI by driving down the cost of inference, which in turn made it cheaper to run AI applications, he said.\n\nLast month, Hangzhou and Beijing-based start-up DeepSeek released its V3 model, which garnered attention because of its low training and inference costs compared with comparative models in the US.\n\nThe company proposed a new way for an AI model to selectively focus on specific parts of input data as a way of reducing the costs of running the model.\u00a0It also used the \u201cmixture of experts\u201d technique popular with other Chinese AI\u00a0start-ups, which also helps to speed up inference because only part of the model is used to generate a response.\n\nDeepSeek said that Huawei had successfully adapted V3 to Ascend, providing detailed instructions for developers on how to use the chip.

But he said Washington had been successful, pointing to statements from Chinese AI groups identifying US export controls as their main obstacle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely impeded the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s ability to produce those chips and ergo have impacted their ability to develop large language models,\u201d said Estevez, referring to the models that power AI products.\n\nThe outgoing under-secretary has straddled two forces: American companies and some allies who believe the US went too far, and critics who wanted the administration to take even harsher, quicker action against China and its military.\n\nHe pushed back against criticism of the recent AI rule, which puts countries into three tiers in terms of ease of access to US chips. Estevez said it appeared to spark more criticism because the companies complaining, such as Nvidia, were household names, unlike the chipmaking equipment producers that opposed other export controls.\n\nOver the past four years, Estevez and Chhabra have held long and often contentious talks with allies, particularly Japan and the Netherlands, to build a seamless export control regime for chipmaking tools.\n\nTokyo and The Hague eventually agreed to many actions pushed by Washington \u2014 in some cases after threats of extraterritorial action \u2014 but the talks highlighted a problem for the US and allies: Chinese retaliation. Beijing threatened to restrict exports of two critical minerals, gallium and germanium, to Japan if it went along with Washington.\n\n\u201cWe do need to think harder about how we are going to wean ourselves off adversarial supply chains,\u201d said Estevez, explaining the need to reduce Beijing\u2019s ability to create choke points that make it harder for the US and allies to take actions against China.\n\n\u201cWhat I wish we had done sooner\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009is sharing our intelligence [with allies] and where we see threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we do that, they actually say: \u2018Yeah, you\u2019re right\u2019, and that makes it easier to dialogue.\u201d\n\nEstevez noted some companies struggled to understand the national security implications of selling technology to China, particularly because they had focused on that market for decades before Washington became more hawkish on Beijing.\n\n\u201cFor American business, it was like \u2018gung ho\u2019 until suddenly it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t think everyone has got that in their strategic mindset of where those lines are,\u201d said Estevez, adding that the US government needed to do a better job explaining the risks to companies who did not have security clearances.\n\nWhile the administration has been criticised by industry, others have questioned why the government did not take quicker action against efforts by Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei to move into the chip sector.\n\nEstevez said the US was \u201creally successful\u201d in using controls to target equipment going to fabrication plants linked to Huawei.\n\nBut he said the US could not take immediate action when it discovered in 2023 that Huawei was building chip fabrication plants, partly because unilateral moves would not have been effective and also because it needed more intelligence to explain the threat to allies to seek their co-operation.\n\nAs Estevez leaves office, he stressed that the Bureau of Industry and Security, which he runs, needed more resources to deal with the expanding threat. It also needs more modern technology, including AI, to boost efficiency in order to, for example, stay on top of Chinese companies that change their name to avoid scrutiny from the US.\n\n\u201cI wish I could have made the inter-agency process a little more agile and a little more strategic,\u201d he said, noting that he and Chhabra would normally \u201ccut a deal\u201d but then have to grapple with the whole government.\n\nEstevez said his biggest concern as he prepared to hand over the reins to Donald Trump\u2019s team was China\u2019s technology sector, particularly AI, which he described as the \u201cfuture of warfare\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the good side of that future, too,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019re just going to impede the bad side of that future.\u201d", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8ba7df25-1d91-46f9-a1f7-6814343c7884"}, {"uuid4": "dccf92f8-7e7c-4f28-9c5e-c56aa7f0dfbd", "title": "Trump\u2019s trade challenge ", "description": "Biden\u2019s parting gift throws down the gauntlet to the incoming president on industrial policy", "author": "Rana Foroohar", "published_date": "2025-01-20T05:00:58.701Z", "content": "The first Trump administration reversed America\u2019s stance on global trade. Joe Biden then doubled down on Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, while adding industrial policy to the mix. Now his parting gift to Trump is a new trade verdict that argues for US government support for the maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors in the face of Chinese competition. It will be the first big test of whether Trump\u2019s second term will be focused on the economic desires of his base, or the \u201ctech-industrial complex\u201d decried by Biden in his parting speech.\n\nThe timing is no accident. The investigation, issued by the US trade representative under Section 301 of the Trade Act, lays out how China has used non-market practices to dominate the global maritime industry. While Biden has supported pushing back against such practices, not everyone in the Democratic party has been eager to make the shift. By releasing the case four days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, the departing administration has made sure it didn\u2019t get derailed by Democrats who would prefer to tip-toe away from the issue of Chinese mercantilism. It also threw down a gauntlet for Trump. Will tariffs be his only tool? Or will he support industrial policy and US workers in more effective and durable ways?\n\nWhether or not you support Section 301 action, it\u2019s tough to read the case and argue that China\u2019s behaviour in shipbuilding isn\u2019t discriminatory. There are the usual problems, like massive state loans and access to non-market excess capacity in raw materials. Then there are the distortions in the Chinese labour market that make it nearly impossible for market economies to compete in the maritime sector, where China now has a market share of more than 50 per cent.\n\nOne of the most interesting sections of the report dives deep into the hukou system. In this, Chinese citizens are classified as rural or urban residents, and can\u2019t receive state benefits such as education, housing, or healthcare outside the jurisdiction in which they were born. Since many rural residents migrate to coastal areas to work, the result is that half of the population resides in urban areas, but only a third have an urban classification.\n\nThat has a hugely distorting effect on Chinese and global labour markets. As one scholar quoted in the report notes, the hukou system creates a \u201chuge class of super-exploitable, yet highly mobile or flexible industrial workers for China\u2019s new economy, now closely integrated into global trade networks\u201d. It is essentially a massive state transfer from labour to the owners of capital, which is one of the reasons why Chinese economists concerned about bolstering domestic consumption would like to get rid of it (hukou reform is happening, though not as fast as many would like).\n\nIt\u2019s also one of many ways in which China\u2019s system is incompatible with the Bretton Woods trading system as it exists today. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that China\u2019s very different economic model makes it difficult to have a system of globalisation based on WTO rules,\u201d notes economist and Nobel laureate Michael Spence. Indeed, that\u2019s the reason that Biden\u2019s trade representative, Katherine Tai, pushed (albeit unsuccessfully) for a new model of trade based on setting a floor, rather than a ceiling, on environmental and labour standards.\n\nTrump certainly won\u2019t care much about the former, but politically, he will need to care about the latter. The fractures between the Maga base and billionaire class populating the top ranks of his administration are already showing. If he chooses not to take on the shipbuilding support recommendations left by his predecessor, unions and Maga hardliners alike will pitch a fit, which could sow major discontent in his first 100 days.\n\nBut I\u2019m betting that the Trump administration will take up the issue, and perhaps even offer up more vigorous support than Democrats might have done. Trump loves bright shiny objects, and nothing is brighter and shinier than a new aircraft carrier.\n\nMore importantly, there are legitimate national security and commercial supply chain reasons to build more non-Chinese maritime capacity. Nearly half of US goods and 80 per cent of global trade is transported by ship. China can significantly influence the pricing and availability of ships given its share of the market. It\u2019s hard to imagine that this power wouldn\u2019t be weaponised in the event of any US-China conflict. Trump has already suggested the US build ships with allies like South Korea.\n\nOf course, increasing maritime capacity is a long-term, heavy lift. And yet, the success of the Chips Act, which has rebooted US semiconductor production in less than two and a half years, shows that it is possible to create more resiliency and redundancy in critical industries when there is political will. The question is whether Trump will have any. Slapping tariffs on adversaries and allies alike is much easier than actually crafting a multifaceted industrial policy.\n\nThat said, the political pull towards it will be pressing. Much of the Biden administration\u2019s stimulus went into red states. The Chips Act is supporting construction of new semiconductor plants in Ohio, Texas and Arizona, all of which voted for Trump. The bipartisan Ships Act introduced last month provides a road map for maritime industrial policy. Whether Trump follows it will say much about the direction of his second term.\n\nrana.foroohar@ft.com", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ffc372e5-3ec5-4c4b-9f60-c4c8f6129fa0"}, {"uuid4": "9dff3f15-5c3d-4100-8d8b-bdf62f04c1fb", "title": "China can outfox Trump\u2019s tariffs", "description": "Beijing is agile enough to swerve US protectionism", "author": "Tej Parikh", "published_date": "2025-01-19T12:00:52.889Z", "content": "Welcome back. Donald Trump will be inaugurated as US president on Monday. What better time to stir the pot with a contrarian take on his team\u2019s plans to squeeze China in trade, manufacturing and technology?\n\nUnderstandably, many reckon that additional tariffs and restrictions on China will be bad for its economy. But Trump\u2019s protectionist efforts could cause less harm than expected. In fact, Chinese industry could prosper in spite (or even because) of them. Here are the counterarguments.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the immediate, direct economic impact of tariffs. China has diversified away from the US market since Trump\u2019s first term. Total American demand for Chinese goods now accounts for about 2.8 per cent of China\u2019s GDP, according to Capital Economics.\n\nIts calculations suggest that an increase in the effective tariff from around 15 per cent to 60 per cent (in extremis) \u2014 as Trump has threatened \u2014 could shrink the Chinese economy by a mere 1 per cent. (Other economists end up in the same ballpark.)\n\nThat\u2019s perhaps smaller than many thought, and it is also before considering other offsetting factors.\n\nChina can divert exports to other destinations where there is rising demand. After tariffs hit the country in Trump\u2019s first term, Beijing\u2019s exports to fast-growing emerging markets soared. Demand for Chinese goods in the developed world excluding the US also picked up. Other nations \u2014 particularly those in the Belt and Road Initiative whom China has spent decades strengthening economic ties with \u2014 will want to maintain low-cost trade with Beijing.\n\nNext, Chinese goods could still find their way to the US via trans-shipment \u2014 export through a third country \u2014 which would allow producers to avoid the levies. Trump has cottoned on, and is looking to clamp down on countries such as Mexico and Vietnam. That won\u2019t be easy or fast. Chinese companies are already hedging this risk by setting up factories across the world.\n\nThe renminbi is also likely to weaken when tariffs are announced. That will keep Chinese exports competitive. (Depreciation in the renminbi offset the impact of levies in Trump\u2019s first term.)\n\nAll things considered, the direct economic hit could be well below 1 per cent.\n\nCost of living pressures and the urgency of climate change mean the economic rationale to import cheaply from China (at least beyond the US) remains strong.\n\nChina\u2019s price competitiveness comes from its specialism in sourcing, refining and producing goods that align with global growth sectors. A decades-long, state-led industrial strategy has given China vertical dominance of the supply chains for electric vehicles, batteries and renewables, from rare earth commodities to finished products.\n\nThe country commands close to a third of global manufacturing output (exceeding the output share of the next nine largest producers combined). It has a revealed comparative advantage across a broad range of goods: not just the old-school \u201cMade in China\u201d toys and clothing, but high-end, sophisticated products too.\n\nIndeed, efforts to restrain China\u2019s industrial prowess often underestimate just how dominant it is and Beijing\u2019s ability to use state apparatus to support its producers. Goldman Sachs\u2019 China economist Lisheng Wang has suggested \u201ccontinued policy support for high-tech manufacturing\u201d and \u201cfiscal easing\u201d would help mitigate the impact of tariffs.\n\nBeijing could use rising US protectionism around the world as an opportunity to improve trade ties with America\u2019s frustrated allies. It could also retaliate by blocking access to vital raw materials. China has 36 per cent of the world\u2019s rare earth reserves, but controls 70 per cent of the global supply (hence Trump\u2019s obsession with Greenland).\n\nFinally, though the west has advantages in artificial intelligence, semiconductors and quantum computing, protectionism in these areas may not hinder China\u2019s development of advanced technologies as much as some might expect.\n\nBNP Paribas Asset Management\u2019s Chi Lo argued in a note last year that \u201crestrictions can only bolster China\u2019s resolve to become tech self-sufficient\u201d. Lo\u2019s view brings the proverb \u201cnecessity is the mother of invention\u201d \u2014 popularised by 20th-century Danish economist Ester Boserup \u2014 to mind.\n\nWith national control over its private sector, Beijing is using subsidies, directives and incentives to meet President Xi Jinping\u2019s objective to be world-leading in scientific and technological innovation. State-driven industrial strategy has its flaws, but China is better than any other at doing it well.\n\nThat means US export controls can incentivise Chinese companies \u2014 supported by Beijing \u2014 to redouble efforts on import substitution and tech independence through innovative workarounds, domestic collaboration and even black markets. Manufacturers face \u201cfierce competition\u201d with one another for state support.\n\n\u201cOn net, American restrictions have accelerated China\u2019s innovation drive,\u201d said Dan Wang, a fellow at the Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center. \u201cBefore, Huawei and BYD would buy the best components on the market, but now their incentives are aligned to the Chinese government\u2019s. Huawei\u2019s money now goes to local semiconductor firms.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, China led in just three of 64 critical technologies between 2003 and 2007, but had become the lead country in 57 of those technologies between 2019 and 2023.\n\nDespite being cut from western semiconductor supply chains, Huawei and SMIC developed a smartphone with cutting-edge chips in 2023. Last year, Huawei unveiled plans to mass produce an AI chip.\n\nBeijing has developed a domestic engine to power scientific innovation. It has the world\u2019s largest number of STEM graduates, and provides long-term capital for research and development (which, as a share of GDP, is closing in on the US). This has undermined the restrictions put in place in Trump\u2019s first term and under Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nStill, things may not go China\u2019s way. For instance, Trump\u2019s protectionist agenda could drive wider global uncertainty, depressing demand and amplifying the hit from tariffs on Beijing\u2019s economy. The rest of the world may get tougher on Chinese imports too. Plus, the country\u2019s state-led innovation model is no panacea. It relies on the government making the right calls when allocating (and pulling) funds. That can be wasteful.\n\nChina also has significant structural economic issues. Its growth trajectory has weakened, and it is struggling to revive animal spirits and boost consumption levels following the property market crash. That leaves it too reliant on export- and investment-led growth.\n\nBut the point remains.

It emphasised China\u2019s desire to grow in power and prosperity by integrating into the international system, without posing a threat to other nations.\n\nThe strategy succeeded: from the 1990s to the mid-2010s, China\u2019s GDP and global influence rose spectacularly. Xi Jinping, however, changed course. Beginning in 2017, he launched a set of tactics that became known as \u201cwolf warrior diplomacy\u201d. Chinese diplomats became more assertive in defending China\u2019s interests. And in a few short years the Chinese government succeeded in undoing much of the goodwill that years of peaceful rise had engendered.\n\nIn 2023, Xi backed off. But this aggressive advance of China\u2019s interests had made it worse off in the world, creating lasting distrust and convincing many of China\u2019s partners to hedge their bets by strengthening relations with the US.\n\nNow, US president-elect Donald Trump and his merry band of tech titans are embracing their own brand of Wild West diplomacy, amplified with a dose of Silicon Valley swagger.\u00a0Its hallmarks are supreme self-confidence, a disregard for rules of any kind and a willingness to make deals with anyone anywhere as long as they advance immediate self-interest.\n\nTrump himself lives in a world of self-bestowed superlatives, which find a ready echo in his new friends from California. Many of the men who have risen to power and unimaginable riches on the back of technological innovation assume that American superiority over other countries is as evident as the superiority of the tech sector over the rest of the US economy. It is the future, and they control it.\n\nSuch attitudes seem certain to create a regular stream of incidents and mini-crises with other countries. Yet based on the Chinese experience, the issue will not be this or that outrage, but the steady accumulation of statements and actions that gradually permeate the domestic politics of other nations, shifting coalitions in consequential ways.\n\nAs Xi discovered, Beijing\u2019s truculence and bald assertion of entitlement strengthened the hand of China hawks in both the US and the EU, and sowed doubt among former China supporters. Long-term damage to the relationship between Washington and Beijing was the result not only of Trump\u2019s actions during his last term in office, but also a deep shift in the views of former Obama officials who entered the Biden administration and built on many of Trump\u2019s anti-China policies.\n\nPushing US technological supremacy, in particular, will embolden those in other countries who are already seeking to challenge the grip of big American tech companies. The EU has been fighting the power and reach of those companies for over a decade. The new Trump administration, following Meta\u2019s refusal to deploy its artificial intelligence in the EU, is likely to force showdowns that will provide a needed spur to the creation of integrated European technology and defence markets.\n\nIn countries such as Mexico, India, Brazil, Turkey, South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia and Indonesia, even where current leaders are friendly to Trump, the constant push from Washington to open markets and improve terms of trade in favour of US companies will alienate local entrepreneurs and exporters.\n\nThe US, like China in the wolf warrior years, will increasingly be known for breaking and circumventing domestic and international rules. Demands that everyone else \u201cpay up\u201d for American military protection could look ever more like a global extortion racket.\n\nRising middle powers, now able to play a much more independent role on the global stage than in the 20th century, are not willing to be pawns in a US-China competition. They will insist instead on asserting their own national interests in the same way that Trump wishes to put America first.\n\nThe George W Bush administration eschewed international rules and processes in favour of \u201ccoalitions of the willing\u201d. Since then, Republican unilateralists have been followed by Democratic multilateralists who spent years repairing damage to the US\u2019s global relationships and creating new informal alliances and coalitions.\n\nThis cycle, however, has worn away trust and confidence in the US\u2019s reliability as a partner and ally. Add a heavy dose of arrogance and insult, and the damage caused by the next era of American wolf warrior diplomacy could be permanent.", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f0226f61-f243-4326-ae64-9965ee9908c2"}, {"uuid4": "9fcf9ea4-24d6-41e4-817b-b85ec2903412", "title": "EU should welcome Chinese car factories, says Mercedes chief ", "description": "Ola K\u00e4llenius urges Brussels to drop protectionist approach in form of punitive tariffs on China EVs  ", "author": "Kana Inagaki", "published_date": "2025-01-19T05:00:52.479Z", "content": "The EU should encourage Chinese carmakers to open more plants in the bloc as part of a deal to drop punitive tariffs on imported Chinese electric vehicles, the boss of Mercedes-Benz has said.\n\nOla K\u00e4llenius, who is also president of EU car industry body Acea, said China had asked European carmakers to invest domestically to access its market decades ago, and that approach could form part of a solution to the trade dispute.\n\n\u201cNobody disagrees about the fact that the level playing field is a legitimate discussion.

He has threatened to impose tariffs on imports from China and many other countries but it is unclear whether he will do so to gain leverage for negotiations with Beijing or whether he will start negotiations over a possible trade deal with China and apply tariffs if the talks are not successful.\n\nThe conversation comes two days before US app stores are obliged to stop carrying TikTok, the video-sharing app that has been downloaded by more than 170mn Americans. The law \u2014 upheld in a Supreme Court ruling on Friday morning \u2014 bans the app unless its Chinese owner ByteDance sells the platform.\n\nTrump has expressed support for TikTok, raising questions about whether his administration will prosecute companies that violate the law.\n\nUS-China relations plummeted to their lowest point since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1979 during the Biden administration over issues ranging from US export controls to differences over Taiwan.\n\nWhile Biden and Xi succeeded in partially stabilising relations over the past year, the countries remain at loggerheads over a range of issues, including Chinese support for Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTrump has named several vocal China hawks to serve in his administration, including Mike Waltz as US national security adviser and Marco Rubio as secretary of state.\n\nScott Bessent, the nominee for Treasury secretary, this week said Trump would push China to buy more US agricultural produce, such as corn and soyabeans which were part of a narrow trade deal he did with China last time.\n\nBessent said Trump would also be aggressive in imposing export controls that would affect China. Beijing has frequently slammed the Biden administration for introducing tough export controls on chips and technology related to artificial intelligence in an effort to slow down the modernisation of the People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\nBut China experts are watching closely to see if some of the technology billionaires in Trump\u2019s orbit, such as Elon Musk, will attempt to convince the incoming president to take a less tough stance on the issue.\n\nAdditional reporting by Joe Leahy in Beijing", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/498536a5-5af1-4ee7-a85c-e1e879bc62e7"}, {"uuid4": "ac670cb3-59de-4fc8-8d41-6024ca68ee76", "title": "TikTok says it will \u2018go dark\u2019 without US government action", "description": "Chinese-owned video app warns of blackout for 170mn users after Supreme Court upholds divest-or-ban law", "author": "Stefania Palma", "published_date": "2025-01-18T02:13:41.363Z", "content": "TikTok on Friday warned of an imminent blackout for its 170mn US users after the Supreme Court upheld a divest-or-ban law targeting the video app.\n\nThe law compels TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the platform by January 19 \u2014 the day before Donald Trump returns as US president \u2014 or face a nationwide ban.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that, for more than 170mn Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\u201d the Supreme Court wrote in a unanimous opinion published on Friday.\n\n\u201cBut Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\u201d it added.\n\nFollowing the ruling, Joe Biden\u2019s administration said the outgoing president would not enforce the ban during his remaining days in office.\n\n\u201cGiven the sheer fact of timing, this administration recognises that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next administration, which takes office on Monday,\u201d the White House said.\n\nBut TikTok late on Friday said statements from the White House as well as from the Department of Justice had \u201cfailed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok\u2019s availability\u201d in the US.\n\nIt added: \u201cUnless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the law, without a sale, it will be unlawful for companies to provide services to distribute or host the video app, or they will face fines of $5,000 per user.\n\nIt remains unclear whether tech groups such as Apple, Google and Oracle, which offer such services to TikTok in the US, would take the risk of continuing to partner with the company over the weekend. It is also unclear whether the app could also take itself offline deliberately, to protect its partners.\n\nApple, Google and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social after the ruling that his \u201cdecision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation\u201d, adding that the court\u2019s decision was \u201cexpected, and everyone must respect it\u201d.\n\nIn a video posted on TikTok following the court\u2019s decision, the group\u2019s chief executive Shou Zi Chew gave no reassurances on whether the app would continue to function in the US on Sunday, but lavished Trump with praise.\n\n\u201cI want to thank president Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,\u201d he said, adding the president-elect \u201ctruly understands\u201d the platform.\n\nUS attorney-general Merrick Garland said the court\u2019s decision \u201cenables the justice department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponising TikTok to undermine America\u2019s national security\u201d.\n\nDeputy US attorney-general Lisa Monaco said the \u201cnext phase of this effort \u2014 implementing and ensuring compliance with the law after it goes into effect on January 19 \u2014 will be a process that plays out over time\u201d.\n\nTikTok has said any spin-off would be technologically unfeasible, while Beijing has indicated it would oppose any sale.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling was handed down shortly after Trump on Friday said he had discussed TikTok on a call with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping. It was the first call between the leaders in four years.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling upholds one of the boldest legislative moves of Biden\u2019s term just days before the Democratic president leaves the White House.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump\u2019s incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz said the legislation \u201callows for an extension as long as a viable deal is on the table. Essentially that buys president Trump time to keep TikTok going\u201d.\n\nChinese officials have held preliminary discussions about whether billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 now a close ally of Trump \u2014 could broker a deal for the app\u2019s sale, the Financial Times reported this week.\n\nSome potential buyers and partners have been circling and lobbying Trump. These include Frank McCourt, an American media and sports businessman, who has established a consortium of investors that would bid for TikTok through his non-profit entity, Project Liberty.\n\nTikTok chief Chew has mounted a charm offensive to cement Trump\u2019s backing, including plans to attend a \u201cvictory rally\u201d for the president-elect in Washington on Sunday and his inauguration on Monday, said two people familiar with the matter.\n\nConcerns Beijing could use the app for espionage or to spread propaganda spurred the law, which was passed with strong bipartisan support last year.\n\nEven though China \u201chas not yet leveraged its relationship with ByteDance Ltd to access US TikTok users\u2019 data\u201d, the top court said, there was \u201cno basis for concluding that the government\u2019s determination that China might do so is not at least a \u2018reasonable inferenc[e] based on substantial evidence\u2019.\u201d\n\nTikTok asked the Supreme Court to hear its case after a US appeals court rejected its challenge to the law, as well as its subsequent request to halt the measure pending further court proceedings.\n\nThe company sought to throw out the law by arguing it was unconstitutional and it violated First Amendment protections for free speech.\n\nAdditional reporting by Aime Williams in Washington and Stephen Morris and Michael Acton in San Francisco", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/edddf2ea-7894-43c3-8cc3-b9a34a3070b9"}, {"uuid4": "d705830f-22bf-4b97-ba48-b61956f8cf2a", "title": "A deeper look at Trump\u2019s tariff team", "description": "Who will set US trade policy?", "author": "Robert Armstrong", "published_date": "2025-01-17T16:54:47.377Z", "content": "Good morning.

Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and aiden.reiter@ft.com.\n\nJudging by the volume of chatter and research reports, Donald Trump\u2019s policy that markets care the most about is tariffs. This makes sense: it could have a direct impact on equities (through prices) and bonds (through currencies). And tariff policy is susceptible, in theory, to the numerical \u2014 or pseudo-numerical \u2014 analysis Wall Street runs on.\n\nBut because the president-elect has said so much about tariffs, not all of it consistent, investors are left to speculate what the policy will be. In hopes of alleviating some of this uncertainty, we summarise below the public statements of Trump\u2019s key economic appointees on the topic. We leave it to readers to decide which advisers, if any, will have the president\u2019s ear, and which proposals will become policy.\n\nScott Bessent: In interviews, opinion pieces, and in a Senate hearing yesterday, Trump\u2019s pick for Treasury secretary lamented that \u201cfree\u201d trade has undermined US competitiveness and created an unbalanced global economy. This is because of \u201cdeliberate policy choices of foreign governments\u201d.\n\nHoward Lutnick: Lutnick, Trump\u2019s pick for commerce, is pro-tariff in a similar vein to Bessent.\n\nStephen Miran: Miran, tapped to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, argues the dollar\u2019s role as the world\u2019s reserve currency is the cause of our global economic imbalances. Normally, the currency of a country that runs a big trade deficit would weaken, making its exports more competitive. But with global demand for the dollar as a reserve, this can\u2019t happen. So the US manufacturing base is being hollowed out and US debts are ballooning. To counter this, he believes:\n\nJamieson Greer: Trump picked Greer, Robert Lighthizer\u2019s former deputy, as US trade representative. Greer\u2019s paper trail is much shorter than the others on this list. That said:\n\nPeter Navarro: Trump named Navarro, a former trade adviser during Trump\u2019s first term, as senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing. Navarro wrote the trade section of Project 2025, the conservative policy playbook written by the Heritage Foundation for the next administration.\n\nKevin Hassett. Kevin Hasset, soon to be director of the National Economic Council, is, like Navarro, a staunch supporter of the RTA.\n\nAll love tariffs. All are interested in using them as leverage. Most are heavily critical of China. All of this fits with Trump\u2019s comments. At the same time, though, they are mostly against blanket tariffs applied at the same level to all countries and all products at the same rate \u2014 which is what Trump, at times, sounds like he wants. The market seems to think the advisers, who generally endorse fiddly policies, will have an influence on Trump, who is more of a sledgehammer guy.

The UN forecasts that China\u2019s population could decline to just over 1.3bn by 2050, while the number of people aged 65 or over is predicted to nearly double.\n\n\u201c[The data] just reinforces the new demographic paradigm that China finds itself in,\u201d said Stuart Gietel-Basten, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. \u201cPopulation decline is not a blip, this is the new normal.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers are pursuing alternatives such as automation and robotics to maintain high levels of productivity, as well as seeking to encourage couples to have more children through a mix of subsidies, tax breaks and cajoling.\n\nWith more than a fifth of the country\u2019s population aged 60 or older, according to official figures, a vibrant \u201csilver economy\u201d has emerged of products and services aimed at the growing elderly population.\n\nBeijing last year unveiled guidelines for the promotion of a market estimated to be worth trillions of renminbi, with a focus on the development of food and healthcare services.\n\nThe state council, China\u2019s cabinet, also announced in October that it was formulating a plan for \u201cbirth-friendly society\u201d as one part of wider efforts to stimulate the slowing economy.\n\n\u201cI think that adapting to this new demographic paradigm is a real priority [for policymakers],\u201d said Gietel-Basten. \u201cA lot of policies have already been brought in and they do recognise that this is a challenge but it\u2019s a matter of how far and how fast you can go.\u201d\n\nSteve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute in London, said the high costs of raising children also contributed to China\u2019s demographic decline.\n\nUnless factors such as these change, \u201cthe government\u2019s policy to encourage more births is unlikely to have much effect\u201d, he added. \u201cIn other words, the prospect is that China\u2019s population will continue to shrink for years, indeed decades, to come.\u201d", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/516f9c37-b9a8-44b1-8e64-10e582f7d5ae"}, {"uuid4": "0521ab38-3149-46de-9807-456946603af3", "title": "China\u2019s GDP growth hits 5% target for 2024", "description": "Analysts and officials warn of threat from tariffs and weak consumer demand", "author": "William Langley", "published_date": "2025-01-17T05:35:37.614Z", "content": "China\u2019s economy grew 5 per cent last year on the back of surging manufacturing, official data showed, as companies front-loaded exports in anticipation of higher US tariffs and as Beijing stepped up stimulus efforts.\n\nThe economy \u201crecovered remarkably\u201d in the fourth quarter of 2024, said the National Bureau of Statistics, growing 5.4 per cent year on year and rebounding from slower growth in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cWith a package of incremental [stimulus] policies\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,\u201d the NBS said in its 2024 GDP data release on Friday.\n\nThe annual figure, which slightly exceeded economists\u2019 forecasts of 4.9 per cent, trailed last year\u2019s growth of 5.2 per cent and was the lowest since 1990, excluding years distorted by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe data comes as Beijing is trying to revive strong growth in a two-speed economy, in which strong exports and manufacturing are offsetting weak household sentiment.\n\nIn September, the central bank announced monetary easing and support for the stock market. Beijing has also launched a programme to refinance local government debt and speed up stimulus spending targeting infrastructure and other areas.\n\nBut economists worry that China is at risk of entrenched deflation. Producer prices have been in negative territory for more than two years, and consumer prices managed growth of just 0.1 per cent in December.\n\nNBS director Kang Yi told a press conference that 2024 could be \u201cdescribed as highly turbulent, marked by intensified geopolitical conflicts and escalating trade protectionism\u201d.\n\nAnalysts expect Beijing to set its official growth target for 2025 at about 5 per cent for the third year in a row when its rubber-stamp parliament meets in March, though trade is expected to face challenges given incoming US president Donald Trump\u2019s threats of higher tariffs.\n\n\u201cThe adverse effects of the external environment are deepening.

Import growth has remained more modest.\n\n\u201cThe current Achilles heel in the Chinese economy is really the hesitant consumer,\u201d Neumann added. \u201cAll this points to the need for more stimulus, particularly the need to support consumer spending power.\u201d\n\nThe release also underlined doubts about China\u2019s official data, which some analysts increasingly worry does not reflect underlying weakness in the economy.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s ostensible attainment of its growth target is a Pyrrhic victory that further erodes credibility in official data and, at best, reflects an economy still beset by underlying fragilities and loss of confidence in government policymaking,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor at Cornell University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley said the better than expected growth in the fourth quarter \u201ccould be shortlived\u201d, and could soften from the second quarter due to export front-loading and insufficient stimulus measures.\n\n\u201cWe think better data has likely reduced Beijing\u2019s sense of urgency, and policy may continue to undershoot on the housing and social welfare front,\u201d they wrote in a note.\n\nChina\u2019s CSI 300 index of mainland-listed blue-chip companies rose 0.5 per cent in morning trading following the data release, after opening lower earlier in the day.\n\nThe benchmark is still down about 14 per cent from its October 8 peak, when stimulus policy announcements stoked a stock rally.", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f9bc8333-1f88-4a70-addf-ba8ae5f587e5"}, {"uuid4": "dc5f207d-9ee9-40f8-923c-df0f5b119155", "title": "How Shanghai\u2019s \u2018western food\u2019 became a cuisine all of its own", "description": "Europeans have come and gone from China\u2019s most populous city, but their food has gone local", "author": "Fuchsia Dunlop", "published_date": "2025-01-17T05:00:08.627Z", "content": "In a private dining room at the Deda, head chef Lu\u00a0Xiaozhou is chatting enthusiastically about sous-vide cooking and molecular gastronomy. An earnest, bespectacled man of 32, he\u2019s been working in this Shanghai restaurant since he was 18 years old. But while he\u2019s au fait with contemporary culinary trends, Lu is a specialist in a unique local genre: Shanghainese \u201cwestern food\u201d. The restaurant\u2019s full name is Deda Western Food Society, a reference to the German entrepreneur who founded it in 1897, combined with a 19th-century Shanghainese term for western cooking, \u201cgreat cuisine\u201d. We meet over cups of milky tea in the private dining room on the top floor, which is decked out in vintage European style with an elaborate mantelpiece and a wind-up\u00a0gramophone.\n\nYou can eat practically anything in Shanghai these days, from authentic Spanish tapas and Italian pizza, to modernist cuisine by the likes of Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Paul Pairet. Yet locals have an enduring affection for their own \u201cwestern food\u201d, the legacy of dishes brought to the city by foreigners in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Deda signature dishes include a local version of borscht (luosong tang, \u201cRussian soup\u201d) made with tomatoes rather than beetroot; pork schnitzel with a dip of \u201chot soy sauce\u201d, a\u00a0Shanghainese homage to Worcestershire sauce which bears no relation to actual soy sauce; \u201cPortuguese chicken\u201d in curried cheese b\u00e9chamel; and a Russian-style potato salad made with mayonnaise and dotted with morsels of sausage, carrot and peas. A hefty platter of cured pork and sausages with gherkins harks back to the tastes of the restaurant\u2019s German founder.\n\nThe food recalls an era when foreigners swanned around in extraterritorial concessions that had been extracted at gunpoint from the Qing Dynasty government in the treaties that followed the opium wars. The city was a free port so visas were not required. There were British, Americans, French, Japanese and Germans, among others. Impoverished White Russians fled here after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Later, the rise of Hitler saw an influx of European Jews. The foreigners recreated the west around them, with dance halls and cocktail bars, delicatessens and restaurants, European-style mansions and the grand riverfront buildings of the Bund.\n\nMany did their utmost to avoid Chinese food. Chinese domestic staff were taught how to cook western dishes. The Anglo-Chinese Cook Book, published in Shanghai in 1916 in two volumes (one in English for the employer, one in Chinese for the cook), includes a few Anglo-Indian recipes but not a single Chinese one. Delicatessens sold imported luxury products from Fortnum & Mason and tinned foods that foreigners could take with them on journeys to the interior, so they didn\u2019t have to eat Chinese food there either.\n\nDeda is one of a couple of restaurants that survive from that era (another is the Red House, a\u00a0favourite of the author Eileen Chang, which is known for its French onion soup and snails or clams in garlic butter). It began as a wholesale shop selling fresh and cured meats and western-style beef dishes, with a German restaurant upstairs that became renowned for its steaks (the Shanghainese themselves traditionally didn\u2019t eat beef because the cow was seen as the farmer\u2019s loyal assistant in the fields).\n\nWhen its original owner returned to Germany in 1910, a Chinese entrepreneur took over and the restaurant continued to flourish. By the late 1940s, it was the largest western restaurant in Shanghai, with a pan-western menu that included not only German, but French, Italian and other western dishes, as well as, at one point, Japanese sukiyaki. It was frequented by celebrities such as the sons of the Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek and the businessman and hotelier Victor Sassoon.\n\nThe first western restaurants in Shanghai were designed to cater to the tastes of homesick foreigners, but the Chinese liked them too. Soon they were opening their own establishments, known as fancaiguan (\u201cforeign\u201d or \u201cbarbarian\u201d restaurants). By the late 19th century, according to historian Mark Swislocki, author of Culinary Nostalgia: Regional Food Culture and the Urban Experience in Shanghai, they were numerous, and often run by Cantonese businessmen who had encountered western food in Canton (Guangzhou), the first international trading port in China. The term \u201cgreat cuisine\u201d (da cai), writes Swislocki, seems to have been coined to distinguish the big chunks of meat eaten by foreigners from daintily cut Chinese dishes, although it later came to mean something like \u201cmajor cuisine\u201d.\n\nEventually, the foreigners left Shanghai, driven out by the Japanese invasion or the 1949 communist takeover. But some of their culinary habits had taken permanent root in the city. Certain dishes, such as the pork schnitzel with \u201chot soy sauce\u201d, Russian soup and potato salad, had become part of the regular Shanghainese repertoire, while Deda and the Red House had become fixtures of the local dining scene. During the cultural revolution, when foreign culture was banned, Deda was obliged to ditch the western food in favour of Chinese fried buns and noodles. At one point it even became a workshop packaging pills for a local medicine factory. In 1973, having somehow survived the worst years of extremism, it resumed trading as the quintessential Shanghainese western restaurant and Russian soup was back on the menu. When the reforms began in the 1980s, locals used it as a place to entertain foreign guests. It moved to its current location on Nanjing West Road in 2008.\n\nAs a child, chef Lu Xiaozhou dined at Deda with his parents and loved the western dishes. Later, they took him on holiday to Europe, where he enjoyed fish and chips in England and a whole lot of cheeses in France. (\u201cUnlike most Chinese,\u201d he says, \u201cI adore the strong smell and flavour of blue cheese.\u201d) He decided to take a job at Deda because his Cantonese girlfriend (now his wife) was a fan of its food. The then head chef, Lao Jianrong, had worked at the restaurant for 45 years and was a life-long specialist in Shanghainese western cuisine. When he retired in 2022, Lu took over: \u201cThis is my platform, and it was a great opportunity to run a restaurant,\u201d he says.\n\nThe kitchen is studiously free of Chinese influences. There is no ginger, regular soy sauce or Shaoxing wine, Lu says, and the chefs ignore Chinese procedures for treating meat and poultry with rice wine and aromatics to refine their flavours. They use western chefs\u2019 knives instead of Chinese cleavers. Outside in the dining room, the tables are laid with knives, forks and spoons rather than chopsticks. In his spare time, Lu has done some modernist cooking experiments, but at work he is more conservative: \u201cAs a chef, I like to try new methods and skills, but my guests here won\u2019t accept these kinds of innovations.\u201d\n\nThe first time I visited Deda, I expected it to be a cultural fossil serving a ghastly pastiche of western cooking. Instead, I was charmed. The dining room was buzzy with Shanghainese families having a great time. And while, for a real westerner like me, the menu was a curiosity that would have made no sense in London, or indeed anywhere but Shanghai, the Russian soup, grilled crabmeat in b\u00e9chamel and potato salad were freshly made and delicious. On subsequent visits I tasted other dishes and chatted to customers. They included elders who had been dining there for decades and young professionals eager for a bit of culinary nostalgia. Sometimes I would sit in the caf\u00e9 downstairs, drinking coffee with retirees who spent hours there every day and eating cakes from the in-house bakery. I never saw another\u00a0foreigner.\n\nIn one sense, Shanghainese western is the equivalent of American and British Chinese food, a resolutely inauthentic cuisine curated to suit the tastes of those outside its original cultural sphere. But while Chinese food in the west is still largely made and marketed by Chinese immigrants, the chefs preparing vintage Shanghainese western are invariably Chinese. Most, like Lu Xiaozhou, have devoted their entire careers to this particular style and have no professional training in the Chinese culinary arts.\n\nThe Shanghainese, long famed for their \u201cShanghai style\u201d (haipai) culture, an eclectic mix of influences from all over China and abroad, have made these old, classic dishes part of their own culinary tradition. Local bakeries sell palmiers (known in Chinese as \u201cbutterfly crisps\u201d, hudie su) alongside Chinese pork-stuffed mooncakes. Sometimes, the palmiers are filled with black sesame seeds or Ningbo seaweed. Shanghainese steamed soup dumpling shops offer pork chops with \u201chot soy sauce\u201d as a side dish, although here they cut the meat into chopstickable pieces, so it can be eaten with Chinese food. Potato salad and Russian soup are served alongside local braised pork and stir-fried ricecakes with shepherd\u2019s purse.\n\nShanghainese western is not the only version of western cuisines that has been adopted and adapted by Chinese eaters and cooks. The Russians left their culinary footprints in Harbin, near the border with Siberia, in the form of bread and sausages. People in Qingdao have brewed beer since the city was a German treaty port. Best known is Hong Kong\u2019s \u201csoy sauce western cuisine\u201d, a local fusion born from the collision of Chinese and western tastes, with classic dishes including chicken wings in so-called \u201cSwiss\u201d sauce (the name supposedly based on a misapprehension of the English word \u201csweet\u201d). Casual \u201ctea restaurants\u201d or cha chaan teng in Hong Kong offer a fabulous assembly of localised western dishes, from French toast drizzled with condensed milk to macaroni in tinned chicken soup. Many Cantonese dim sum restaurants serve English-style custard tarts and offer Worcestershire-style sauce as a dip for deep-fried dumplings.\n\nThe opening up of China to foreign influences in the 1990s has also provided new ground for mash-ups of western culinary ideas with Chinese tastes. Outside the contemporary western restaurants, often run by foreigners, you can find pizzas topped with durian, strawberries or chocolate and crisps flavoured with cucumber or steamed garlic shrimp. Unforgettably, a waiter in a small town in Sichuan once brought me a perfect espresso with a side dish of chilli-spiked pickled radish instead of a biscuit.\n\nBut Chinese, like most cuisines, has always been multicultural. Noodles emerged after the adoption from central Asia of the rotary mill for grinding flour some two millennia ago. The sesame-sprinkled flatbreads and syrup-drenched pastries of Beijing are the legacy of ancient Silk Road contacts, while modern Sichuanese cuisine was born of the meeting of an ancient native spice (Sichuan pepper) with a relatively modern American import, the chilli. Each generation adds its own layer of culinary influences.\n\nShanghainese western food is another reminder that the notional borders between cuisines are arbitrary, fragile and porous, and cultural appropriation is the human condition. Humans are like magpies, attracted by bright shiny trinkets and exciting tastes. We steal ideas, whether from our slaves or our oppressors. The politics of the exchange may vary depending on who is doing the appropriating, but the compulsion is always there.\n\nIn ancient China, the people of the central plains despised the hairy barbarians beyond their own cultural pale but couldn\u2019t resist some of their food. In Shanghai and the other treaty ports, the snooty behaviour of colonials may have rankled, but it didn\u2019t stop local people developing a taste for their chunks of meat and buttery pastries. Similarly, in contemporary America, China may be seen as a rival and a possible enemy, but Chinese food is stitched into the nation\u2019s culinary ecosystem and its affections (the enraged slogan \u201cLove our people like you love our food\u201d went viral during protests against anti-Asian racism at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic).\n\nAppropriation happens in all directions, unpredictable and chaotic. The Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce that inspired Shanghainese \u201chot soy sauce\u201d was, in turn, derived from an Indian recipe that may have incorporated a Chinese condiment: actual soy sauce. The tomato ketchup that appears with some dishes at Deda may be an American import, but its true origins lie in the fermented fish sauces of south-eastern China and their name (ke-tschup) in old Hokkien dialect.\n\nIn 2013, two Americans, one of them of Chinese heritage, opened a restaurant in Shanghai called Fortune Cookie serving something exotic to local palates: American Chinese food, including orange chicken and crab rangoon. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, the restaurant 1908 British Chinese (named for the date when the first Chinese restaurant opened in central London) specialises in dishes inspired by British Chinese menus.\n\nDespite all the evidence, we like to see cuisines as fixed anchors of our identities. Over time, even things that were once novel are viewed as fixed and immutable. People go to Deda for a taste of the past and a sense of continuity between generations. While the menu has evolved, with the addition of chocolate fondant pudding and other more contemporary offerings, Lu Xiaozhou says his job is to preserve the restaurant\u2019s roots in its classic dishes, \u201cwhich cannot be changed\u201d. \u201cI have a duty to pass these dishes on to my apprentices,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a tradition that has been handed down, and we must certainly preserve it.\u201d\n\nFuchsia Dunlop is the author of \u201cInvitation to a Banquet\u201d, Fortnum & Mason Food Book of 2024\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014\u00a0follow FT Weekend Magazine on\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0FT Weekend on\u00a0Instagram", "tag": "china?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/20abc36a-9904-4605-83d7-bc2ea87e1433"}, {"uuid4": "e3ee0a4c-dd31-48ef-a423-4dd183c1e269", "title": "Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to step down after 20 years", "description": "Finance minister Lawrence Wong to become city-state\u2019s fourth leader next month", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2024-04-15T12:48:56.054Z", "content": "Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will step down next month after nearly 20 years in power, handing over to his deputy in what will be only the third leadership transition in the Asian financial hub\u2019s modern history.\n\nLawrence Wong, deputy prime minister and finance minister, will become Singapore\u2019s leader on May 15 after being named heir apparent in 2022 as part of the ruling People\u2019s Action party\u2019s long-standing succession plan.\n\nThe departure of Lee, the son of Singapore\u2019s founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, raises expectations for a consequential general election that could be held as soon as this year.\n\nThe PAP, which has governed Singapore since independence, earned one of the lowest vote shares in the 2020 election in the city-state\u2019s history. The party has been seeking to recover public support and bolster Singapore\u2019s status as a trade and financial hub amid an increasingly febrile geopolitical backdrop.\n\nIn a post on social media platform X, Lee, who has served as prime minister since 2004, asked Singaporeans \u201cto give Lawrence and his team your full support, and work with them to create a brighter future for Singapore\u201d.\n\nWong said in a video statement he never expected to be asked to be the prime minister when he entered politics in 2011. \u201cI accept this responsibility with humility and a deep sense of duty,\u201d he said.\n\nThe succession marks an important moment in Singapore\u2019s modern history, as just the third time the leadership baton has been passed since independence in 1965.\n\nWhile planning to ensure a smooth succession had been under way for years, the process has also faced a number of setbacks.\n\nLee, 72, had intended to step down before turning 70, plans that were derailed by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe PAP\u2019s succession strategy was thrown into disarray in 2021 after deputy prime minister Heng Swee Keat resigned as leader of the so-called fourth-generation team, a group of younger ministers lined up to take the reins of the governing party.\n\nWong, 51, was announced as 4G leader in April 2022, and will become only the second Singaporean premier who is not a member of the Lee family.\n\nHe will face a difficult task in maintaining Singapore\u2019s delicate geopolitical balancing act. A trading entrepot, Singapore has evolved into one of Asia\u2019s main financial hubs while maintaining its neutrality between east and west. But its open economy makes it vulnerable to macroeconomic issues and US-China rivalry.\n\nWong warned last year that aspects of the Washington-Beijing rift appeared \u201cinsurmountable\u201d and that tensions over the Taiwan Strait were becoming the region\u2019s \u201cmost dangerous flashpoint\u201d.\n\nHe also faces a challenging domestic environment, with rising discontent over inequality and rising costs of living, in particular housing.\n\nLinda Lim, a Singaporean and professor emerita of business at the University of Michigan who knew Wong when he studied economics there, said he would take over at a time when Singapore faces many new internal and external challenges, including to its economic model.\n\n\u201cThis is the opportunity for [Wong] and the rest of his leadership team to show that they can meet these challenges with fresh ideas and a more participatory democracy and inclusive economy than has hitherto characterised the nation\u2019s political system.\u201d\n\nManu Bhaskaran, an economist and chief executive of consultancy Centennial Asia Advisors, said another question following the \u201cwell choreographed\u201d succession was whether there would be an early general election. Singapore is due to hold elections by November 2025, but is widely expected to do so as soon as September this year.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of talk that the elections will be held well before the deadline. I would think Wong would want his own mandate to lead,\u201d Bhaskaran said.\n\nIn the longer term, Wong will have to contend with a range of geopolitical challenges as well as maintain Singapore\u2019s competitiveness given the rise of rivals such as Dubai and a high-cost structure, Bhaskaran added.\n\n\u201cWe have done well over the past few decades but how do you maintain that?

It simplifies paperwork and reporting, while high reporting and accounting standards allow investors comfort,\u201d he says. iCare has its headquarters in the city state but does not have operations or core employees based there.\n\nSingapore is also a fundraising hub for the region and Caprile says he visits frequently because many of iCare\u2019s investors have a presence in the city-state.\n\nThe company has a catalogue of appliances and works with factories to allow workers to buy the items they need and pay back in interest-free instalments.\n\niCare makes its margins from dealers, rather than charging customers and handles the repayments directly with the factories.\n\n\u201cWe have been running this successfully since 2015, well before \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 was a household name,\u201d Caprile points out.\n\nSkrya, another Singapore-based company at number 10 in the ranking, also gets most of its revenue from outside the city-state. Skrya helps clients, such as automobile parts companies, to recycle materials including palladium, rhodium and platinum via an app, Catalopedia, which uses AI and 3D to determine the best pricing.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to do an old type of business \u2014 recycling \u2014 in a modern way, with apps and tech,\u201d explains Sivakumar Avadiar, chief executive officer for the five-year-old group.\n\nSkrya, which is profitable, has a number of facilities and a team of roughly 10 employees in Singapore. But it is planning to grow internationally this year, opening a new plant in India, which could add another $30mn-$40mn in revenue, Avadiar says.\n\nSingapore\u2019s stable reputation, and the ease of setting up a company there, made it the best choice as a base, he adds. However, he has found the cost of running a business in the city has gone up in recent years.\n\nA survey of business sentiment by the Singapore Business Federation in January found that the increase in business costs is the top challenge companies are navigating, especially the cost of manpower.\n\nEven for tech start-ups, such as X0PA AI \u2014 a software company that uses artificial intelligence and automation to help clients hire employees better and faster \u2014 the environment has been tougher.\n\n\u201cThe market had a massive correction in the past few years,\u201d says founder Nina Suri. \u201cWe had to correct ourselves and take a step back to focus on more sustainable growth.\u201d\n\nX0PA AI is fundraising now, via a second series A round. Suri says the company expects to break even this quarter and hopes to turn a profit by the end of 2024.\n\nSingapore is X0PA AI\u2019s largest market but the company is now focusing on growing in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as the US.\n\nSuri divides her time between Singapore and London but says Singapore\u2019s ecosystem, which includes resources, talent and government support, such as grants, made it a \u201cno brainer\u201d to be X0PA AI\u2019s base.\n\n\u201cBut, for a business like ours you can\u2019t survive and grow enough in just Singapore,\u201d she says. \u201cThe government understands that and we got a grant to expand into overseas markets including the United Arab Emirates and the UK.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the number of Singapore companies on this year\u2019s list looking to expand beyond the city-state, there are still plenty that see opportunities in its small domestic market.\n\nDoctor Anywhere, which started life as a primary care tele-health start-up, is now growing rapidly offline. For example, it recently started operating a health screening and imaging diagnostics facility. The business is ranked 55th on this year\u2019s list with a CAGR of 124 per cent.\n\n\u201cOur underlying business comes from the region but many people come here for top healthcare,\u201d says Wai Mun Lim, co-founder.\n\n\u201cWe are building out our business in the city before replicating many of our services in other countries we operate in the region, including Malaysia and the Philippines.

It almost always runs a budget surplus, and its constitution virtually prohibits borrowing to pay for current spending. All three major credit rating agencies assign it triple-A ratings, and the IMF judges its sovereign debt risks to be low.\n\nBut the country also has a whopping ratio of debt to gross domestic product \u2014 around 170 per cent. By the end of the year it will be the third most indebted nation on the planet. Are there lessons to take from the country\u2019s approach to debt? If so, they come from understanding how it has arisen.\n\nFirst, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has intervened frequently to prevent the Singaporean dollar from appreciating relative to the basket of currencies against which it is managed, selling Singaporean dollars for foreign currency. As with Switzerland, the result has been burgeoning foreign exchange reserves, far more than the government\u2019s estimate of what they need to maintain their peg. The government\u2019s solution to this reserve glut has been to issue close to 40 per cent of GDP in non-marketable debt to the central bank.\n\nSecond, the social security system is configured in a manner bound to drive up government liabilities. Residents and their employers are compelled to contribute a significant portion of their salaries to the Central Provident Fund, from which they can draw money to pay for healthcare, housing and retirement. All CPF receipts are passed back to the government in return for non-tradable government debt certificates, which amount to over 90 per cent of GDP.\n\nThird, the government understands the importance of maintaining a liquid bond market. In the west we\u2019ve come to regard bond markets simply as the only venues large enough to satisfy government borrowing needs rather than public goods in themselves. But absent deep debt capital markets, companies have little option but to channel all their financing needs through the banking system. In the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Singapore acted to ensure that companies could raise funds in capital markets rather than tie their collective fortunes to a small group of financial institutions. Bonds and bills sold into the market add close to 40 per cent to the debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\nGiven a constitutional prohibition on using borrowing to fund day-to-day spending, receipts from debt sales are passed over to be managed by GIC, the government\u2019s wholly-owned fund manager, and invested in global stocks, bonds, infrastructure and private equity. The result is that Singapore\u2019s balance sheet looks more like a hedge fund than a sovereign. And despite significant short-term volatility, this has worked well for them over the medium-term. YeeFarn Phua, a director of sovereign ratings at S&P Global, estimates that the government has amassed a liquid portfolio worth more than $1tn \u2014 twice the level of GDP.\n\nA final source of indebtedness comes from debt-financing strategic local infrastructure. Despite nosebleed-level gross government debt metrics, parliament authorised in 2021 the issuance of S$90bn of bonds \u2014 around 20 per cent of GDP at the time \u2014 to finance projects like tidal walls and subway systems.\n\nDebt-fuelled asset purchases and investment by the public sector don\u2019t always end well. In the UK, Woking council\u2019s leveraged acquisition of a concentrated portfolio of commercial properties didn\u2019t save it from issuing a section 114 bankruptcy notice last year. Arguably, it hastened it. And in 2009, state-backed conglomerate Dubai World needed bailing-out and restructuring after running into problems. But these look more like incompetence than bad luck.\n\nThe Singaporean state has been rewarded for absorbing market risk in the form of a dividend \u2014 worth over three percentage point of GDP \u2014 which is often large enough to flip increasingly persistent primary budget deficits into overall budget surpluses.\n\nFiscal rules can be a useful check on explosive debt dynamics. Six of the seven sets of fiscal rules deployed by UK governments since 2010, for instance, have referenced debt stock. But such a check would have barred the kind of investment that has enriched and developed Singapore. The experience of the city state shows that higher debt issuance is a poor measure of fiscal space. Concerns that markets may revolt if tapped for investment capital have not been borne out.\n\nIn any economy starved of investment, government has a role to play without fear of bond market vigilantism.", "tag": "singapore?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0ea2bcc4-1378-4dec-81af-0fb688edda31"}, {"uuid4": "797b04d7-91c2-4f96-9499-21dcb06026fd", "title": "South-east Asian collectors look beyond Hong Kong\u2019s market", "description": "Political repression in the Chinese city and new regional fairs are shifting the balance of power", "author": "Naima Morelli", "published_date": "2024-03-23T00:01:04.012Z", "content": "In January, walking around Singaporean fairs Art SG and SEA Focus, the attentive visitor could distinctly detect that special inflection of Cantonese typical to Hong Kong collectors.\u00a0It is a sound that has become more common at art fairs in Singapore and elsewhere in Asia in the past few years as enticing alternatives to Hong Kong have emerged.\n\nSouth-east Asian artists and galleries have historically looked at Hong Kong as the go-to place to expand their worldwide reach, thanks to fairs such as Art Basel Hong Kong and the presence of international auction houses. Add to this its free flow of capital, tax-free port status, logistical efficiency and deep pool of talent, and it\u2019s easy to see why regional players have kept returning to the city.\n\n\u201cWhen contemporary Asian art began to flourish, Hong Kong naturally became the hub for collectors and dealers from south-east Asia,\u201d says Singaporean collector Teng Jee Hum. He remembers collectors in south-east Asia using Hong Kong to settle purchases of Chinese ink masters from the mainland from the 1950s to the 1990s. \u201cFrom 2000 onwards, it was the reverse flow,\u201d says Teng, of mainland Chinese collectors buying works from south-east Asia \u2014 but still through Hong Kong.\n\nSouth-east Asia\u2019s engagement with the city is visible at this year\u2019s Art Basel Hong Kong. In the Encounters section for large-scale projects, Filipino artist Patricia Perez Eustaquio will show embroidery and textile work and Singaporean Ming Wong a video installation.\u00a0South-east Asian galleries at the fair include Gajah Gallery, Richard Koh Fine Art and ROH Projects.\n\nBut the past five years have been a more mixed story for Hong Kong. The important M+ museum was completed and international auction houses have moved or are planning to move their regional headquarters to bigger spaces in the city. At the same time, Hong Kong\u2019s position has been challenged by a surge of authoritarianism from the mainland, a reduction of democratic freedoms and harsh pandemic restrictions, resulting in an outflow of people. \u201cAll these developments had a diluting effect on the vibrancy of Hong Kong and we are witnessing some Hong Kong players increasing their Singapore presence,\u201d Teng says.\n\nThese emigrants have been replaced by mainland Chinese people flocking to Hong Kong under new schemes aimed at attracting talent and wealth. \u201cThis is creating a new dynamic in the city,\u201d says Hong Kong collector Alan Lo, who predicts more mainland collectors and patrons will participate in the city\u2019s institutional landscape over time. \u201cI see Hong Kong becoming the Monaco of China where people come to spend money, buy luxury homes and yachts, drink expensive wine, build art collections.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, other regional cities have grown in economic prosperity and bolstered their art market. Teng notes that east and south-east Asia are benefiting from evolving global supply chains, not least thanks to the US-China rivalry. \u201cArt goes where the money is,\u201d he says, pointing out that the Hong Kong stock and property markets are currently languishing, whereas Japan\u2019s and South Korea\u2019s are at or near record highs. \u201cThe latter are also actively promoting art and culture overseas as soft power.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the pandemic and right after, there were many speculations as to whether Hong Kong could maintain its role as the art hub of Asia,\u201d says Lo. \u201cWe have seen attempts by art-fair owners to expand into Singapore, Seoul, Taipei, Tokyo, which makes Asia a much stronger and deeper overall landscape.\u201d In 2023, the fairs Tokyo Gendai and Art SG had their debuts, attracting the international community, while the second edition of Frieze Seoul and the 22nd edition of Kiaf Seoul were held simultaneously.\n\n\u201cSingapore is building itself nicely as a hub for south-east Asian art,\u201d says Lo. He appreciates the state for its diversity and distinct character, which combines Malay, Indian, Chinese and western cultures. \u201cIn a way I feel Singapore responds best to our interest in Asian diaspora.\u201d\n\nRachel Lehmann of Lehmann Maupin gallery, which has a space in Seoul, says the Korean gallery scene is highly developed, due to widespread public interest in contemporary art: \u201cCollectors in South Korea and Taiwan come from a long, intergenerational lineage of collecting.\u201d\n\nEven so, Hong Kong\u2019s rivals are still significantly smaller than it: Singapore and South Korea do not feature in the Art Basel and UBS Art Market Report\u2019s eight largest markets.\n\nIf, for galleries, it\u2019s about choosing the fairs or spaces which offer the best financial results, for collectors it is also about the perks of the fair ecosystem. For example, when travelling to fairs, Alan Lo never misses the chance to visit private foundations and homes to hear the story of their collections. \u201cTaipei is probably the best for it because of the deeply rooted collector community,\u201d he says. \u201cIt also has such an amazing food culture. I\u2019m not going to lie: that plays a big role!\u201d\n\nWhat galleries and collectors agree on is that while Asia as a whole is vast and diverse enough to support multiple art capitals, the market in Hong Kong remains vibrant and unparalleled in the region. \u201cThe parlour game of guessing which city will replace Hong Kong\u2019s hub status has been going on for years,\u201d says Gagosian Hong Kong director Nick Simunovic, \u201cbut there is no replacing this city\u2019s role in Asia\u2019s art ecology.

Japanese companies did not submit proposals during the expression-of-interest process that ended on January 15.\n\nMyHSR will shortlist three to four consortiums for the next phase, the request for proposals round, as early as this month and present its review of the bids to the cabinet, sources said. The Malaysian government is expected to present the proposal to Singapore over the next few months to determine if the city-state wants to take part in the project.\n\n\u201cWe want to finalise [the proposal] as quickly as possible, hopefully over the next three to four months,\u201d a Malaysian official told Nikkei Asia. MyHSR is also discussing an option to extend the line from Kuala Lumpur only to the southern state of Johor if Singapore decides not to participate.\n\nThe expression-of-interest phase of the bidding follows Malaysia\u2019s call in July last year for the private sector to submit proposals to develop and operate the project through a public-private partnership model.\n\nIn August, Singapore said it was willing to discuss any new proposal from Malaysia \u201cstarting from a clean state\u201d, then-acting transport minister Chee Hong Tat told parliament. The city-state said at the time that it had not received any new proposals from its neighbour.\n\nThe revived plan comes as momentum grows for Malaysia to enhance its transport system and help make Johor a regional investment destination. The government signed a memorandum of understanding with Singapore in January to jointly develop a special economic zone in the southern state as a new engine of growth.\n\nSultan Ibrahim of Johor, who became Malaysia\u2019s new king in January, said he wanted to revive the project. \u201cI will make it [come back] on,\u201d he told Singapore\u2019s Straits Times in an interview published in December.\n\nBut Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has said the government will not fund the project and is instead seeking privately backed proposals. Due to the country\u2019s financial constraints, the government favours proposals with \u201ccomprehensive financing\u201d, an official told Nikkei Asia.\n\nDuring the initial review of the private-sector proposals, the Chinese consortium consisting of China Railway Construction, China Communications Construction and the Export-Import Bank of China, was seen as a strong candidate for the shortlist, given its financing scheme, sources said.\n\nThe high-speed railway project with Singapore was first floated in 2013 during former prime minister Najib Razak\u2019s administration. The 350km link, which was agreed in 2016 and due to open in 2026, would have cut travel time between the two cities to about 90 minutes, versus more than four hours by car.\n\nThe high-speed rail line had been expected to boost cross-border business as well as development of areas along the line. The two neighbours have close economic ties, with the air route linking Singapore and Kuala Lumpur among the busiest in the world.\n\nAt the time, the project was estimated to cost about $17bn, and companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Europe had expressed interest in contracts to build, operate and finance the trains and rail assets.\n\nBut the project was hit by multiple delays due to escalating costs and changes in plans. The project was eventually scrapped in 2021, after Malaysia and Singapore failed to reach an agreement. Malaysia paid more than S$100mn (US$74mn) in compensation to Singapore for the termination.\n\nThe latest iteration of the project comes against a backdrop of new high speed rail lines in south-east Asia. In October, Indonesia officially opened the region\u2019s first high-speed railway, connecting 140km between Jakarta and Bandung in less than an hour. The $7bn line was built by a consortium of Indonesian and Chinese state-owned companies, with government support for land acquisition.\n\nBut analysts said significant hurdles would need to be overcome if Malaysia were to complete the project. At an estimated cost of up to RM120bn ($25bn), funding is another obstacle for the government, which seeks to pay for the rail line with capital exclusively from private companies.\n\nAdib Zalkapli, director at advisory BowerGroupAsia, said the project was \u201cvery ambitious\u201d and would be \u201ccostly\u201d for Malaysia to complete without clear government support, although the country\u2019s tight fiscal position poses serious constraints.\n\nTo shore up the country\u2019s fiscal position, Malaysia in October passed legislation to limit the country\u2019s debt to 60 per cent of gross domestic product within three to five years. The country\u2019s public debt as of December had reached RM1.5tn, or more than 80 per cent of GDP, well above this target.\n\nAdditional reporting by Dylan Loh\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on March 6. \u00a92024 Nikkei Inc.

Investing \u00a525bn ($165mn), Shimano renewed the facilities to increase efficiency.\n\nThe company was founded in 1921 by ironworker Shozaburo Shimano in the industrial city of Sakai, just south of Osaka.\n\nIt develops and manufactures a wide range of parts, such as gears, transmissions, brakes and wheels, mainly for sports bikes including road and mountain bikes, with an estimated global share of 85 per cent.\n\nShimano has factories in Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, China and the Czech Republic. In co-ordination with the factories in neighbouring counties, the Singapore plant focuses on midrange products, which account for 70 per cent of the company\u2019s production volume.\n\nThe chair, who served as the company\u2019s fifth president until 2021, said the Singapore plant had been playing a key decision-making role in the company\u2019s global operations. It identifies overseas facilities that need investment and passes on suggestions to the head office in Japan, he said. The company will continue to invest about \u00a540bn annually in facilities and equipment for medium- to long-term growth, 60 per cent of which will be spent overseas, including in Singapore.\n\nEurope and North America are the largest markets for sports bikes, but Shimano is betting on growth in south-east Asia, where most people once viewed sports bikes as luxuries.\n\n\u201cIn countries like Vietnam, bicycles are first and foremost a means of transportation, but as the economy develops, demand for sports bikes will also increase,\u201d he said. He expects roughly 20 per cent of the company\u2019s products will serve end users in south-east Asia in the medium to long term.\n\nThe company is accelerating its efforts to promote sports bikes in south-east Asia by holding bicycle competitions in co-operation with bicycle makers and local agencies. It has been operating a museum, Shimano Cycling World, in Singapore since 2014 to foster cycling culture.\n\nBut Shimano\u2019s road ahead seems more bumpy than smooth, and taking it requires being well-equipped.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Shimano\u2019s performance was buoyed by a surge in demand for outdoor gear. Net sales and income reached record highs of \u00a5628.9bn and \u00a5128.1bn in 2022, a great leap from the \u00a5363.2bn and \u00a551.8bn in 2019.\n\n\u201cWe had anticipated that there would eventually be a slump,\u201d said the chair. In 2023, net sales and income fell to \u00a5474.3bn and \u00a561.1bn as demand declined after the pandemic. The company is now seeking ways to revive its performance.\n\n\u201cAt the time when demand was surging, we had to prioritise increasing production and postpone other projects for medium- and long-term growth that we had begun,\u201d he said. Now the company has resumed one of those projects: increasing in-house manufacturing to shorten delivery times.\n\nAccording to Shimano, the company currently outsources about 50 per cent of its parts for the company\u2019s flagship parts series, Dura-Ace, to subcontractors. \u201cWe make products by combining other companies\u2019 excellent technologies and expertise. We cannot make all of them by ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] the supply chain for bicycles is long, and manufacturing takes time\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009We will be able to shorten the lead time by bringing what we can do in-house to some extent.\u201d\n\nThe company plans to increase its in-house production ratio to approximately 70 per cent for Dura-Ace in the next few years and improve production efficiency by utilising digital and other technologies, with an annual investment of \u00a515bn. \u201cWe should be able to improve profit margins,\u201d he added.\n\nThe competition in the market has increased as e-bikes \u2014 sports bikes powered by lightweight batteries \u2014 become popular and new manufacturers enter the market. \u201cWe will be able to take advantage of our many years of experience as a bicycle parts manufacturer and our knowledge of bicycles,\u201d Shimano said.\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on March 6. \u00a92024 Nikkei Inc.

The margin last year hit 2.14 per cent in January-March, with results steadily declining over consecutive quarters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear on a declining interest rate environment\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the ability to manage costs of deposits will be more important than the ability to manage yield,\u201d said Lee Wai Fai, UOB\u2019s chief financial officer, during an earnings briefing last week. \u201cThe challenge we have is to sustain the NIM\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we have to manage aggressively our deposit base.\u201d\n\nTo stay competitive, Singapore\u2019s banks have raised interest payouts to depositors in the current era of higher financing costs. But the same costs would have deterred some customers from increasing or obtaining new leverage, putting lenders in a position where profitability from loans compresses.\n\nCarmen Lee, an analyst at OCBC\u2019s investment research unit, wrote in a report this month that slower growth in loans and unexpected deceleration in macroenvironment conditions in UOB\u2019s key Asean markets were risks for the bank.\n\n\u201cNet interest margins improved from 1.86 per cent in financial year \u201822 to 2.09 per cent in financial year \u201823,\u201d she wrote of the previous uptick, while noting the less positive prospects ahead. \u201c[UOB] management is guiding for NIM of around 2 per cent in financial year \u201824.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Asean, Thai and Indonesian lenders also grapple with pressure on earnings. Credit research agency CreditSights noted in a January report on Thailand\u2019s lenders, including Krung Thai Bank, TMB Thanachart Bank and Bangkok Bank, that \u201cquarterly NIMs near or has peaked\u201d.\n\n\u201cLoan growth saw yet another weak quarter [from October to December] due to a common focus on quality given elevated household debt and challenged small and medium enterprises, amid a still sluggish and uneven economic recovery,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe banks remain cautious for financial year \u201824.\u201d\n\nIn Indonesia, CreditSights noted in February that lenders Bank Mandiri and Bank Negara Indonesia \u201cdelivered a strong performance\u201d last year, though both faced more NIM pressure.\n\n\u201cFunding costs rose again in quarter four so both banks saw quarter-on-quarter NIM compression,\u201d the report said. \u201cBoth banks have guided for overall flat to slightly lower financial year \u201824 NIMs.\u201d\n\nDBS, south-east Asia\u2019s largest bank by total assets, this month reported that NIM in October-December stood at 2.13 per cent, just a whisker above the 2.12 per cent recorded in January-March and the second-lowest figure last year. Peak performance in 2023 was logged in July-September when NIM was booked at 2.19 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe took a conscious decision to put on some fixed-rate assets in the tail end of the third quarter and fourth quarter,\u201d said DBS chief Piyush Gupta during an earnings call this month. \u201cWe put on about S$30bn in that period of time just to lock in rates to protect us from a declining interest rate environment.\u201d\n\nA report from the equity research unit of Jefferies this month noted a deteriorating global macroeconomic outlook as a risk to DBS, which could limit any upside to capital returns for the bank, after the lender published its earnings results.\n\n\u201c[The] company does not see stress in the book right now,\u201d the report noted. \u201cWe see rather limited upside\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009with costs running slightly higher and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009NIM marginally softer.\u201d\n\nBut there may still be some time left for banks such as DBS to make the most out of high financing costs, with the Fed signalling a cautious approach to any rate cuts in the future.\n\nIn a report this month, the global research unit of HSBC highlighted that for the US central bank, the \u201ctiming of any move to cut policy rates may still depend significantly on inflation readings to come in the months ahead\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have growing confidence,\u201d noted HSBC, quoting Fed chair Jay Powell\u2019s remarks at a January meeting. \u201cBut not to the point where we feel like it\u2019s a highly consequential decision to start the process of dialling back on restriction.\u201d\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on February 27. \u00a92024 Nikkei Inc.

HongShan has previously said the Singapore office was set up to fulfil local legal requirements.\n\nAnother person familiar with Shen\u2019s situation said he had been spending little time in Singapore and still appeared to be based in Hong Kong with frequent travel to mainland China.\n\nShen, 56, became an early mover in a trend that became replicated many times over by wealthy Chinese, especially those tied to the country\u2019s tech sector. Many shifted to low-tax, stable Singapore amid strict pandemic lockdowns in the mainland as well as President Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on tech companies and calls for wealth redistribution.\n\nThe city-state, which has a large ethnic Chinese population, strikes a neutral line between the US and China.

The divorce resulted in three separate businesses: HongShan in China, Peak XV in India and south-east Asia and Sequoia Capital in the US.\n\nHongShan has since sought to become more global, pursuing business opportunities and investments worldwide to benefit its Chinese portfolio companies.\n\nOne mainland start-up in the healthcare industry backed by HongShan told the Financial Times it had received advice to start a Singapore entity as that would ease its expansion into international markets including the US. Two other co-investors in start-ups also backed by HongShan said founders had been told to establish a Singapore presence.\n\nSome have already been set up. Beijing-based Moonshot AI, which last week raised $1bn, last year established a Singapore entity.

Both companies are backed by HongShan.\n\nHongShan declined to comment, but a person close to the company said many of its portfolio companies had offices around the world, including in Singapore.\n\nHongShan, Moonshot AI and ByteDance were named in a US congressional report this month which scrutinised American capital invested in Chinese tech companies that support Beijing\u2019s military and its repression of minorities in Xinjiang.\n\nMeanwhile, other Chinese business figures, particularly in the investment and technology sectors, have sought residency in Singapore and expanded or opened offices in the city-state in recent years.\n\nSean Tong, the co-founder of China\u2019s Boyu Capital, a leading private equity firm set up by a grandson of former Chinese president Jiang Zemin, relocated to Singapore from Hong Kong during the early stages of the pandemic.\u00a0Boyu opened a Singapore office in 2019.\n\nZhang Lei, the billionaire China-born founder of Hillhouse Capital, became a Singaporean citizen.

But if, as a guest, you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve stumbled into a bit of magic, and aren\u2019t made to feel looked after, then you\u2019re just enjoying a great drink \u2014 not a great bar. Having been fortunate enough to travel and witness first-hand the plethora of different bars, clubs and restaurants around the world \u2014 and having worked in, owned and run a wide range of venues for some 20 years \u2014 I\u2019ve become quite particular about how I define a fantastic bar.\n\nBelow are some of my favourite places around the globe that aren\u2019t solely focused on serving a quality product, but offer the total package, feel inclusive and reflect a passion \u2014 and even though they\u2019re off the beaten track, they\u2019re well worth making a special effort to visit.\n\nThis is a contender for my favourite bar in the world: understated, charming and an important piece of Madrid history. It became a popular hang-out for Republican soldiers and their supporters during the Spanish Civil War, and to this day there\u2019s a homeliness, with no photography allowed (though modern clientele are probably less wary of potential spies knocking around). There are barrels of sherry on offer (try the Palo Cortado \u2014 a dry style that jumps between savoury, nutty and aromatic), simple yet superb snacks (I usually order the anchovies on bread and some bottarga) and even a resident cat padding around. Over an evening, the atmosphere evolves from rather sedate to raucous when guests spill on to the streets. Madrid is said to have more bars per capita than any other European city, so naturally there are great cocktail spots and vermuter\u00edas adjacent, should you wish to hop between a few places. I also like nearby Viva Madrid, but I wouldn\u2019t be in a rush to leave La Venencia. It's the perfect place to settle in for a few hours. Website; Directions\n\nThere is no shortage of good bars in Melbourne, a city renowned for its craft cocktail culture, but a real favourite is Caretaker\u2019s Cottage, located behind a church on Little Lonsdale Street in a tiny bluestone cottage (a former caretaker\u2019s quarters). It strikes the perfect balance of cocktail bar, home from home and pub, and is owned and operated by some dear friends and ex-Lyan family, who offer the warmth of Aussie hospitality in the most wonderful way. Chat to the team, listen to great music and drink through the short but well-crafted menu. They\u2019re known for having Guinness on tap and milk punch (a milk and brandy or bourbon-based cocktail that originated in the 18th century), and a cleverly curated wine list. Website; Directions\n\nJust a few blocks away from Caretaker\u2019s Cottage, Section 8 is a cool outdoor bar that first started as a pop-up but did so well it became a permanent fixture. Locals call it the \u201cContainer Bar\u201d because it\u2019s in a converted shipping container that\u2019s located in a car park in Chinatown. It\u2019s a fun place to grab a drink while soaking up the Australian sun and taking in a bit of Melbourne\u2019s music scene (it regularly hosts bands). Drinks are fittingly summery and nod to iconic songs: my favourite cocktail is the \u201cGood Kid, M.A.A.D Litty\u201d (a riff on the Kendrick Lamar album) made with tequila, hibiscus and lemongrass syrup, guava nectar and citrus. Website; Directions\n\nThis is the bar I wish was part of the Lyan family. An Edinburgh institution that still manages to feel like a local spot, with great Guinness, a lively atmosphere and warmth, and well-priced drams of single malt whisky. It\u2019s a beautiful little stone building tucked away on a cobbled side street in the New Town, and the small space doesn\u2019t take much to get packed out. Stepping through the door almost feels like you\u2019re in a time warp, instantly looping you in to a real sense of community. This is the place to go for real ales, with rotating taps from Scottish craft breweries, and the friendly staff are more than happy to talk you through their selection. Website; Directions\n\nOwned and run by Jean Trinh, a friend, super-talented bartender and one of the nicest figures in the industry, Alqu\u00edmico, which is based in a renovated colonial mansion, is a wonderful showcase of Colombia, one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. It\u2019s no surprise that this bar has been named the best in all of South America for the past few years. Jean\u2019s commitment to highlighting indigenous knowledge, ingredients and culture is channelled through three floors of dancing, food and cocktails, each with a different personality, offering something for any occasion. The menu is a celebration of Colombia\u2019s brilliant produce with inventive applications. I recommend the taquitos with banana peel, the yucca dumplings and the ahuyama (squash) ceviche, while sipping on a Selva martini (replete with aromatic herb oil) or a Kianga, marrying local fruits, herbs and honey with one of my favourite Scottish single malts.\u00a0Website; Directions\n\nIn a city renowned for its phenomenal culinary scene, it is no surprise that Copenhagen also offers many great cocktail bars to explore, though its natural wine and beer scene is what really excites me. From hole-in-the-wall venues to converted warehouse spaces and stylish modern bars, there\u2019s something for every occasion. And although wine bars and a brewpub might seem like things you can find elsewhere, these three places \u2014 from the decor to the service to the atmosphere \u2014 feel distinctly Danish.\n\nVed Stranden 10 is one of the city\u2019s most stylish natural wine bars. Set in a historic tea shop, the charming canal-side venue is not known for its menu but lack thereof, so it\u2019s best to ask the knowledgable staff for a recommendation. Featured wines come from small, independent producers, so you\u2019re likely to enjoy something you\u2019ve never heard of, or learn something new. Website; Directions\n\nPompette, a natural wine bar and shop in the chic N\u00f8rrebro neighbourhood, has despite its popularity remained strong on its mission to sell top-quality products at reasonable prices. I recommend a glass of one of Tschida\u2019s wines, a producer in Austria\u2019s Burgenland, and a fried chicken sandwich from Poulette, the bar\u2019s takeaway sandwich shop right next door. Website; Directions\n\nCraft beer lovers will be acquainted with Copenhagen\u2019s Mikkekeller, and its Warpigs brewpub is a must-stop for me for a locally brewed something (you can cover all tastes here) before exploring the old Meatpacking District and its restaurants and art spaces. Website; Directions\n\nAs historic spaces go, this one, south Asia\u2019s grand-dame hotel, is particularly fabulous, and despite my ancestral connection, I love it simply as it channels a bygone era. The hotel, which opened in 1864, is one of the oldest east of the Suez. I came here with family just to enjoy the glamorous setting, but ended up settling into cocktails using Rockland produce \u2014 a pioneering local family distillery that\u2019s been operating for a century on the island. It\u2019s an incomparable spot to sit back on a waterside terrace, order a daiquiri and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. Website; Directions\n\nI love tea for its complexity, variety and versatility as much as I do whisky, so I love finding venues that are committed to it as much as great bars are to their booze. This lively restaurant dates back nearly a century, and has a magical touch balancing styling, product and service that makes you feel like you\u2019ve wandered into a different era. Order everything (from the very cool, old-style menu cards) \u2014 the traditional dim sum are delicious \u2014 and lean into the great atmosphere. Website; Directions\n\nAn Australian export to a city replete with great bars, this taverna offers the magic of traditional stylings, local wines, beers and cocktails alongside the requisite tapas \u2014 but the energy and service are what makes this particular spot stick out. The local Txakoli wine \u2014 fresh, light and zesty with a slight minerality \u2014 alongside the richness of cured tuna and ham or a steak tartare is a match made in heaven. But with an impressive list of local wines (many by the glass), along with some other old world gems, the trick here is to go with enough friends to tackle the whole menu. Website; Directions\n\nNew York has some of the best drinking spots in the world and, given that cocktails are an American invention, the city has you covered for everything from pitch-perfect classics to seasonal specialities and cutting-edge serves. But this Brooklyn joint brings the joy of a dive bar, with live music, sparkling wine on tap and very cold beer. This is an unpretentious spot in Bushwick, and there other great places about (Empirical\u2019s new distillery is nearby), but first have a boilermaker (beer with a shot of bourbon on the side) \u2014 and see where the night takes you. Website; Directions\n\nSingapore is a wonderful melting pot of cultures and uniquely positioned at the centre of so many international influences, but before this cocktail bar opened, many bars (and restaurants) \u2014 even at the finer end of the spectrum \u2014 focused on Western ideals and ingredients. Co-owner Vijay Mudaliar (again, a friend, ex-Lyan family and one of the loveliest folks in the industry) wanted to celebrate his homeland in a more authentic manner, embracing local ingredients, music, materials and accents. What results is a wonderful love letter to Singaporean culture, with flavours and compositions you won\u2019t find anywhere else.

They have largely failed to deliver an era of quicker listings of tech upstarts on Asian exchanges.\n\nMost Spacs listed in the two financial centres have failed to bring privately held companies on to their stock exchanges. Nor have any new Spacs made their debuts in Singapore or Hong Kong last year, after a flurry of initial public offerings of these fundraising shell companies in 2022.\n\n\u201cInvestor interest in Asian Spacs has been poor,\u201d said Mak Yuen Teen, a professor of accounting at the National University of Singapore Business School. \u201cThe experiment with Spacs is over in Singapore, and probably Hong Kong, even if the exchanges do not want to admit it and claim that there may be other Spac listings in future.\u201d\n\nSingapore may have beaten Hong Kong to listing the first Spacs in January 2022, but Mak called that victory \u201chollow\u201d. Three Spacs \u2014 Vertex Technology Acquisition, Novo Tellus Alpha Acquisition and Pegasus Asia \u2014 launched IPOs on the Singapore Exchange that month.\n\nTwo years later, only Vertex, backed by Singapore state investor Temasek, completed a merger. The other two failed to do so, setting both on a path to dissolution, with the money raised via their IPOs returning to investors.\n\nVertex merged with 17Live in December, allowing the Taiwan-founded livestreaming platform to bypass a traditional IPO, which was the appeal, at least in theory, that Spacs presented to tech start-ups looking to go public.\n\nA traditional IPO involves a more arduous vetting process and typically requires more time. Spacs do the initial work of the IPO, with the start-up using it as a vehicle to become a publicly traded company via a merger, also known as a \u201cde-Spac\u201d.\n\nUS markets paved the way for the rise of Spacs in 2021 when the Covid-19 pandemic was in full swing and interest rates were low, which fed risk appetite among investors for fast-growing, but also cash-burning, tech start-ups.\n\nSingapore unicorns such as Grab and Sea Group, or start-ups with a value of over $1bn, listed in the US, with Sea doing so via a traditional IPO while Grab went public with a de-Spac.\n\nThe ambition was for Asian exchanges to take a slice of the lucrative Spac pie, and Singapore and Hong Kong formalised their rules for blank-cheque companies by 2022, opening the way for sponsors and their targets to make it work.\n\nBut this has not always produced the desired results. 17Live\u2019s share price, for instance, has dived more than 70 per cent from the benchmark set by the shell company it merged with.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the Singapore experiment with Spacs has failed,\u201d Mak said. \u201cWhile SGX may claim that there is now a Spac framework, and does not rule out future Spac listings, I think it is game over.\u201d\n\nSGX, the city-state\u2019s bourse, has not had a new Spac listing after the first three. Its rival, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has also seen a drought in such listings.\n\nAccording to financial markets data provider LSEG, the last Spac to list on the Hong Kong market was TechStar Acquisition in December 2022, bringing the total number of blank-cheque companies to five. With no new Spacs listed since then, only two \u2014 Aquila Acquisition and Vision Deal HK Acquisition \u2014 found target companies to merge with.\n\n\u201cSince the launch of the Spac regime in Hong Kong in 2022, it has yet to spark significant waves,\u201d said Hebe Chen, market analyst at IG International. \u201cEscalating fears of a global recession and China\u2019s lacklustre economic recovery have contributed to a growing cautious mood in the Hong Kong market, leading to a sharp decline in market valuations and restricted liquidity.\u201d\n\nSoaring inflation, coupled with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, helped to make investors skittish. The US Federal Reserve set the tone by jacking up interest rates and central banks elsewhere have followed suit, ending the era of cheap money that helped fuel the rise of Spacs.\n\nThe performance of de-Spaced entities has also been lacklustre.

It was only in November 2023 that it logged its first quarterly profit on an adjusted basis since its founding more than a decade ago.\n\n\u201cInterest towards Spacs has been extremely speculative, and only investors with higher risk appetites were really willing to inject funds into the listed vehicles,\u201d said Oriano Lizza, a sales trader at trading platform provider CMC Markets. \u201cSpecifically, with higher [interest] rate environments, investors were not required to take such risk, and opted for risk-free returns in the case of fixed deposits and government bonds.\u201d\n\nPol de Win, SGX\u2019s head of global sales and origination, said the bourse\u2019s decisions on Spacs were not made based on one market cycle, but for the longer term, adding that a scenario where blank-cheque companies make a comeback in \u201cthe next five years\u201d is possible.\n\nHe said that for a good de-Spac to occur, the IPO environment has to be \u201cconducive,\u201d and this has not largely been the case for the last two years. \u201cIf we go back two years, we would have hoped that we were in a different position now,\u201d de Win said. \u201cBut a lot of that, or pretty much all of that, is just down to timing and market conditions.\u201d\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on February 12. \u00a92024 Nikkei Inc.

Police also seized assets including luxury properties, cars, designer handbags, gold bars, cash and cryptocurrency in raids across the city.\n\nIn the wake of the probe, authorities have turned a closer eye on Singapore\u2019s most affluent residents, visiting auto dealerships and real estate groups and warning in October that luxury assets including cars, watches and handbags may be subjected to anti-money laundering controls.\n\nPrivate bankers have also tightened due diligence processes for new clients, leading to longer waiting times to open accounts and set up family offices.\n\nCircle 33, which was famed for its extensive wine menu with prices that ran into six figures, came to symbolise the flow of wealth to Singapore during the pandemic, especially from super-rich Chinese fleeing draconian restrictions in mainland China.\n\nCo-founded by Zhang Tao, the co-founder of restaurant review site Dianping, and backed by Chinese business figures such as Min Fan, co-founder of travel group Ctrip, Circle 33 gained notoriety by attracting high-flying executives from China, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, according to multiple people who frequented the club.\n\n\u201cIt was printing money but members stopped going after it was spoken about in the media and earned a reputation,\u201d said one person who visited the club on multiple occasions.\n\nAnother person close to the club said Circle 33 did not make enough money, forcing the owners to decide against renewing the lease.\n\nOn a recent visit by the Financial Times, there was no sign of Circle 33 at the villa on Scotts Road save for terracotta statues in the garden.\n\nJade Koh, who is listed as the general manager of Circle 33 on LinkedIn, declined to comment. The club does not have a website and its Google listing said it was permanently closed.\n\nWhile the money laundering investigation, which Singapore police said had been in progress for years, was announced after Circle 33\u2019s quiet closure this summer, the scandal has swayed the city-state\u2019s wealthy to avoid flaunting their privilege, especially as the cost of living rises.\n\n\u201cThe economy is not as robust,\u201d said Aaron Goh, a high-end events planner for eXposure Entertainment, who has observed a drop-off in demand for personalised parties over the past six months.\n\nLee Lee Langdale, owner of Singolf Services, a club membership brokerage, said prices had been rising \u201cuntil the money laundering case in August\u201d thanks to demand from foreigners, especially from China. \u201cSince then it has been really quiet,\u201d she said.\n\nGolf clubs have also begun more strictly examining suspicious payments, she added, while membership prices have come down, with joining fees at Sentosa Golf Club falling from about S$950,000 to S$850,000 (US$709,000-US$635,000).\n\nSay Kwee Neng, a car industry consultant, said sales of luxury and super-luxury brands had also come under more scrutiny, on top of a targeted tax rise introduced last year.\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, I heard stories of how the authorities were visiting authorised dealers for Porsche, Ferrari and Bentley,\u201d he said. \u201cSpecifically they wanted to know why more detailed background checks weren\u2019t conducted by the dealers to ascertain the source of funding for these people of interest.\u201d\n\nHigher duties have also contributed to a fall in luxury home sales in the second half of last year, according to real estate industry experts.\n\n\u201cThe high-end market fuelled by foreigners was already softening due to higher stamp duty costs,\u201d said one real estate agent specialising in foreign buyers. \u201cThe laundering scandal was the nail in the coffin.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/26c45d81-6d42-48be-8d4c-38b18214c35d"}, {"uuid4": "ffb941fc-61e6-49fb-b07a-2abf25a3e81d", "title": "Classic escapes with contemporary chic", "description": "Odes to the clever overhaul \u2013 from the Eastern & Oriental Express to haute Saint-Trop", "author": "Maria Shollenbarger", "published_date": "2024-02-04T05:00:51.156Z", "content": "From 1993 until the Covid-19 pandemic, the Eastern & Oriental Express ran from Singapore to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur and Penang.

He faces a penalty of up to S$100,000 and seven years in prison if found guilty of corruption.\n\nThe charges allege he received kickbacks totalling more than S$384,000 (US$285,770) in value between 2015 and 2022, according to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau.\n\n\u201cI reject the allegations in the charges and will now focus on clearing my name,\u201d Iswaran said in a resignation letter made public by the office of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday. Iswaran added that he would return his salary and allowances received since the beginning of the investigation in July last year.\n\nLee said the government would continue to deal with the case \u201crigorously\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am determined to uphold the integrity of the party and the government, and our reputation for honesty and incorruptibility,\u201d Lee said, referring to the ruling People\u2019s Action party, of which Iswaran was also a member until his resignation this week. \u201cSingaporeans expect no less.\u201d\n\nThe charges came about six months after the anti-graft agency arrested Iswaran and Ong Beng Seng, one of the city-state\u2019s most high-profile property tycoons. Both were released on bail.\n\nThe corruption watchdog said Iswaran received some of the alleged bribes for \u201cadvancing Ong\u2019s business interests\u201d in a contract between his company Singapore GP Pte and the Singapore Tourism Board, a government agency.\n\nAccording to a charge sheet seen by the Financial Times, the kickbacks allegedly included tickets to English Premier League football matches, Formula One races and plays including Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Hamilton and Kinky Boots, as well as a business class flight from Doha to Singapore in 2022.\n\nIswaran, who previously served as Singapore\u2019s minister of communications and of trade and industry, was instrumental in bringing the Formula One Grand Prix to Singapore in partnership with Ong in 2007.\n\nOng has not been charged. He is the founder of Hotel Properties, which has brands such as the Four Seasons and Intercontinental in its property portfolio. The company has previously said that Ong was providing details of his dealings with Iswaran to the watchdog.\n\nSingapore GP Pte declined to comment. The Singapore Tourism Board did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ong declined to comment.\n\nThe corruption case comes amid mounting scandals for the ruling party, which faces a crucial leadership transition this year.\n\nPrime Minister Lee is set to hand over power to his deputy Lawrence Wong as soon as November, in what will only be the fourth change of leadership in Singapore\u2019s history. In 2025, the country will go to the polls in a race that PAP, which has ruled Singapore uninterrupted since independence in 1965, is again expected to win.\n\nLee said last year that the graft accusations against Iswaran and Ong, along with the resignations of two senior PAP lawmakers over an \u201cinappropriate relationship\u201d, had hit the party\u2019s reputation.\n\nSingapore\u2019s ministers are among the highest paid in the world, earning about S$1mn a year, in part to discourage corruption.

Coinciding with Singapore Art Week and notable museum show openings, the fair has generated a \u201cstep up of activity in town\u201d this year, according to its co-founder Magnus Renfrew.\n\nSupport from the region\u2019s individual collectors bolsters many events, including at the so-called Private Museum, which is in fact a hybrid non-profit charity founded by the real estate developer Daniel Teo and his daughter Rachel Teo in 2010. Shows here include works from 15 members of \u201cArt Addicts Anonymous\u201d \u2014 an informal WhatsApp group that has become a thriving collectors circle \u2014 and of art owned by Pierre Lorinet, a financier-turned-philanthropist who is a member of ART SG\u2019s 26-person advisory group. Elsewhere, the British curator Zo\u00e9 Whitley organises an exhibition of 100 artists from Africa and Asia at Gillman Barracks for The Institutum, founded by the international collector Andreas Teoh.\n\nRenfrew notes the acceleration of money flowing into Singapore, including through its thriving biotech and tech sectors. This year\u2019s edition of the fair is however nearly a third smaller than its inaugural edition \u2014 with about 110 galleries versus 160 in 2023 \u2014 which, Renfrew says, reflects that galleries are \u201chaving to make short-term, pragmatic decisions\u201d in a softer market. But, he says, \u201cgiven the wider context of the ascent of Singapore\u2019s relevance geopolitically and geo-economically, ART SG has the potential to play a role in building a key cultural and art market hub over the coming years.\u201d\n\nTwo Australians who forged their careers in London have moved back and will open a new gallery in Sydney on February 24. Tania Doropoulos, previously artistic director of Frieze London and Frieze Studios, and Matt Glenn, a former director at Sadie Coles gallery, have identified a \u201cgenerational shift\u201d among gallerists and collectors in Australia and believe that now is a good time to begin catering to the widening demand. The art market\u2019s move towards Asia is among the dynamics helping to put Australia on the map, they say.\n\nThe gallery will be called \u201cPalas\u201d, to invoke a sense of palatial hospitality, and so spelt after \u201can accident between an artist and an artificial intelligence\u201d, Doropoulos says. The two-story space is in the city\u2019s fast-developing Zetland area, and opens with a show of new silkscreen paintings by Marco Fusinato (US$35,000-$45,000). Fusinato represented Australia in the 2022 Venice Biennale, participating every day in a performance that ran for the event\u2019s 200-day run.\n\nThe Palas founders plan to join the international art fair circuit, they say. \u201cArtists here want to engage more internationally but it can be a very difficult leap, without physically relocating to the northern hemisphere, which can take years out of their practice,\u201d Glenn says. Doropoulos adds that there is also demand from artists outside of Australia to build their profile there. \u201cThe biennial and museum sectors are showing a much better exchange but the gallery sector is not as participatory overseas,\u201d she says. Other shows in the pipeline include those of the Irish artist Eva Rothschild, who also recently represented her country at Venice, and Canada\u2019s Tamara Henderson.\n\nExperimenting with a new business model is Matt Carey-Williams, who left Victoria Miro gallery in London last year and is now setting up solo. His venture will have a physical space \u2014 at 12 Porchester Place near Marble Arch \u2014 where he will hang about 10 small and short shows a year, each a \u201cclose up\u201d of one artist. The first of these \u201cScenes\u201d runs February 6-March 2 with work by Glen Pudvine (b1989, \u00a33,500-\u00a311,000), whom Carey-Williams first encountered at Pudvine\u2019s Royal Academy Schools\u2019 graduate show. It\u2019s at this level that Carey-Williams feels he can really make a difference, offering exhibitions without demanding official representation. \u201cThere is a real thirst for artists who haven\u2019t even graduated yet, which is risky for everyone, especially the artist,\u201d he says.\n\nHe will supplement the Scene showings with \u201cEpisodes\u201d, larger-scale group exhibitions based on a theme, which will run in different venues around the world. The first of these, Bump, will be at Frieze\u2019s 9 Cork Street building, March 7-23, and will comprise 21 artists including Marc Dennis, Clare Woods and Flora Yukhnovich (prices up to $140,000). Carey-Williams says he is likely to go to Seoul for a future Episode in the autumn.\n\nHot on the heels of his\u00a0Blackness, White, and Light\u00a0exhibition that closed this month at the Mumok museum in Vienna, American artist Adam Pendleton gets his first solo gallery show in New York for more than 10 years at Pace from May 3. The show, including 20 recent paintings and works on paper, is an extension of the Vienna exhibition \u2014 which itself was a continuation of his best-known series, Black Dada and introduced colour for the first time.\u00a0The Pace works will be priced between $65,000 and $450,000.\n\nThe artist\u2019s \u201cnearly continuous institutional exhibitions over the past 10 years\u201d, including also at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art and the KW Institute of Contemporary Art in Berlin, are a reason why it has taken so long for him to have a commercial show in his home town, says Samanthe Rubell, president of Pace, which has represented the artist since 2012. The artist, who explores the relationship between blackness and abstraction, is \u201cone of the most relevant working today\u201d and \u201creflects how we experience the world in the 21st century through its palpable feeling of everything happening at once\u201d, she says.\n\nInstitutional demand has not exactly cooled \u2014 also in the planning is a large-scale, site-specific commission for the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington DC, slated for Spring 2025.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FTWeekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life and Art wherever you listen", "tag": "singapore?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e1680168-7638-46d4-ae8c-f0dab97e5e9a"}, {"uuid4": "df467d4a-1719-4654-9e5e-5e319386e0ec", "title": "South-east Asian and Latin American artists united in tropical storm at National Gallery Singapore", "description": "A new exhibition looks at parallels in how artists from both regions handled revolution and freedom", "author": "Adeline Chia", "published_date": "2023-11-27T05:00:49.550Z", "content": "The Mexican revolution was finally over. The civil wars and agrarian uprisings that overthrew a dictator and established a constitutional republic ushered in a new era of Mexican nationalism. In Frida Kahlo\u2019s \u201cSelf-Portrait with Monkey\u201d (1945), the artist, dressed in a robe from the indigenous Tehuana people of Mexico, trusty spider monkey at her shoulder, throws us a haughty glance from under her unibrow. Celebrating pre-colonial cultures and female empowerment, this self-portrait captures a mood of defiance and confidence.\n\nContrast this with \u201cSelf-Portrait\u201d (1958) by Patrick Ng, rendered a year after the Federation of Malaya, formerly British Malaya, became independent. The artist, a Chinese man, has depicted himself as a Malay woman. The queering (from man to woman, Chinese to Malay) makes this a slippery painting. On one level, it seems to be expressing ambivalence about \u201cMalayanisation\u201d, a national development programme to build a homogenous identity in a multiracial state. But it could also be read as a vision of a future society of radical fluidity, where typical markers of identity can be transcended.\n\nTwo self-portraits made during periods of national transformation; two very different moods. They are placed side by side in Tropical: Stories from Southeast Asia and Latin America at National Gallery Singapore, billed as the first major comparative survey of art from the two regions. One of its propositions is that self-portraiture was a strategy that artists from both sides of the globe used to comment on societal change and to imagine new worlds.\n\nBut is this a strategy exclusive to these regions? Self-portraits have everywhere and always offered commentary and vision. Beyond this, the show connects the art from diverse territories under a grand narrative of anti-imperialist resistance and sundry other rebellions. Besides self-portraiture, other threads in the show include the incorporation of local traditions, such as in the stacked totems of Rubem Valentim that reference Afro-Brazilian customs, as well as the innovative use of crafts, as seen in Barbara Sansoni\u2019s geometric handwoven textile works suspended from the ceiling.\n\nTo unite all this, the curators propose a concept called \u201cTropical\u201d, described as a \u201cdefiant attitude\u201d that \u201callowed for the most imaginative possibilities to emerge even from the most trying of circumstances\u201d. While not very illuminating (even verging on reductive, as it suggests that equatorial types are governed by their passions), it does generate an atmosphere of solidarity: the tropical as a hothouse space of restless ferment and unruly fecundity.\n\nIs this convincing? Only if you take \u201ctropicality\u201d as a poetic mood or a speculative proposition, which allows for some fudging of timescales and the fusing of diverse liberatory struggles. The sweeping concept takes some serious creative licence and does not properly account for global conditions. The curators propose that although independence in both regions happened at different periods \u2014 most of Latin America between 1808 and 1826, south-east Asia between 1945 and 1957 \u2014 their art histories followed similar trajectories and can be mapped on to each other. But as this is mostly a 20th-century painting show, the Latin American artists are mischaracterised by this line of reasoning; by that time, some of them were fighting local dictators rather than colonial overlords.\n\nBut this is an ambitious and meaningful project. As interest in the art from the Global South grows, there is particular focus on south-to-south exchanges. Here, two regions occupying peripheral roles within a \u201cglobal\u201d history of Eurocentric modernism have placed themselves centrestage. White people are not invited, with the exception of Paul Gauguin, who opens the exhibition as a common enemy. His \u201cPoor Fisherman\u201d (1896), showing a naked native from French Polynesia drinking from a coconut shell, exemplifies lingering stereotypes of the tropics as idle, primitive and backward.\n\nOver the course of the show, this trope gets soundly rebutted by more than 200 artworks showing labour, resistance and futuristic visions of Global South solidarity (even before the term was coined). The argument is borne out in three sections, roughly chronological in order. The Myth of the Lazy Native explores how artists resisted European representations of colonial subjects in a series of figurative paintings that celebrate local life, industry and cultures. Here, we have a Brazilian fruit-seller on a boat with a wonderful expression of bored disdain (Tarsila do Amaral, \u201cThe Fruit Seller\u201d, 1925), a Mexican woman making tortillas (Diego Rivera, \u201cWoman Grinding Maize\u201d, 1924) and a street-theatre performance in Jakarta (Hendra Gunawan, \u201cMonkey Dance\u201d).\n\nThe second section, This Earth of Mankind, roughly maps on to the post-independence period, in which artists grappled with national identities and melded traditions with experimentation. As part of the exhibition\u2019s populist manoeuvres, a mirror has been put between two Indonesian modern masters for visitors to take selfies. On the left, we have Chinese-born Lee Man Fong\u2019s careful self-portrait dressed in a tropics-appropriate white T-shirt and surrounded by Greek statues, signalling his parity with European traditions; on the right, the Indonesian artist Affandi\u2019s visage composed of chaotic squiggles, achieved by squeezing tubes of paint directly on to the canvas and smudging them around with his fingers. Following them is a pageant of self-portraits that eventually culminates in an exploration of how artists elevated craft traditions to art.\n\nFinally, The Subversive brings us to the present day. This is where the exhibition becomes the most multidisciplinary, with installations, videos and sculpture. Curatorially, it\u2019s a bit of a free-for-all: so long as the artist is challenging something, she\u2019s in. But it ends up being the strongest section. Liberated from a linear narrative, the works speak a language of defiance, fierceness, sensuality and mystery. Bali\u2019s I Gusti Ayu Kadek Murniasih\u2019s sinuous figures with explicit genitalia upend sexual conservatism with joyous lasciviousness.\n\nIt is also here that the western category of \u201cart\u201d gets destabilised by Singaporean Malay artist Mohammad Din Mohammad\u2019s talismanic paintings. As a Sufi mystic and healer, his works are packed with pieces of wood, animal bone and shells in crowded compositions which are believed to be therapeutic to the viewer. One wonders whether \u201ctropical\u201d could involve a fusion of different paradigms, such as art, spirituality and medicine, which make up singular practices in the Global South that cannot be easily assimilated into western aesthetic categories? In any case, this exhibition is a starting point for imagining how we can broaden the ways we narrate creative processes from around the world.\n\nTo March 24, nationalgallery.sg", "tag": "singapore?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/989f5642-e308-4593-91e7-d35f4d09bc2a"}, {"uuid4": "7e3f785f-4017-4e02-838c-163fa6df401d", "title": "An insider guide to Singapore\u2019s regional fine dining scene", "description": "These restaurants marry the region\u2019s myriad cuisines with contemporary cooking styles. Here\u2019s where to find its most exciting chefs at work ", "author": "Cheryl Tiu", "published_date": "2023-11-22T00:00:37.668Z", "content": "This article is part of a\u00a0guide\u00a0to Singapore from FT Globetrotter\n\nWhile Singapore has long been a bastion of fine dining, its award-winning repertoire over the years has tended to lean French or Japanese. In recent years, however, a slew of young, talented chefs has challenged this stance \u2014 and the misconception that local (which, due to the city-state\u2019s history as a trading post in the 19th and 20th centuries, can be anything from Chinese, Malay, Indian and Peranakan) had to be \u201ccheaper.\u201d\n\nThese cuisines, as well as those from neighbouring states, were previously mostly found only at hawker stalls and casual joints. Today, they can also be enjoyed on multi-course tasting menus, proudly celebrating their respective chefs\u2019 heritages.\n\nThis shift began with the birth of \u201cmod-Sin\u201d, or modern Singapore cuisine, attributed to chef Willin Low, who coined the term in 2005 to describe his cuisine at the now-closed Wild Rocket. There, he recreated the hawker favourite char kway teow using thinly sliced cuttlefish in place of noodles, and topped stir-fried Hokkien mee with luscious king prawns.\n\nMod-Sin has continued to gain momentum. In 2014, banker-turned-chef Han Liguang opened Labyrinth, serving progressive Singaporean flavours and sourcing the vast majority of ingredients locally (a particular feat in a state where limited agricultural production means that more than 90 per cent of food is imported from overseas). When Busan-born chef Sun Kim opened his first iteration of Meta in 2016, he specialised in French-inspired fare. But he has since shifted towards highlighting his Korean heritage and its produce, with the famed abalone from Jeju Island now a mainstay on his menus. And at his namesake restaurant Thevar, which opened in 2018, chef Mano Thevar translates his Indian heritage into modern dishes.\n\nThe critics started paying attention: in recent years, all of these restaurants were awarded Michelin stars and ranked on the Asia\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants list.\n\nBut that was just the beginning. As soon as the Covid-19 stay-at-home orders were no longer in place, a new wave of young south-east and East Asian chefs opened their own fine-dining restaurants \u2014 or completely refreshed an existing one \u2014 with their respective heritages as a focal point. Below are five of the most exciting places that celebrate the vastness of the region\u2019s cuisines.\n\nSeroja serves multi-course tasting menus that pay tribute to the vast flavours and culinary traditions of the Malay Archipelago, heralding 29-year-old chef-owner Kevin Wong\u2019s homeland. Since opening last year, it has been awarded a Michelin star, as well as a Michelin Green star for its sustainability efforts (Singapore\u2019s first), while Wong himself picked up Michelin\u2019s Young Chef nod too, which recognises rising stars in the culinary world.\n\nDiners begin a meal at Seroja with delicate one-bite wonders, such as obsiblue prawns in a caramelised sambal hitam (a black chilli paste), anchovies topped with finely shredded leek, or barbecue eel with sare roti (wherein the flatbread is seasoned with sare, a seaweed found abundantly in the Malay Peninsula, that has been dried and turned into a powder). This is usually followed by a memorable bread course: Malaysian roti paung (aka butter buns) that are steamed before being deep-fried. Soft, pillowy and crisp on the edges, the pull-apart roti is served with a hand-dived scallop on an aromatic laksa sauce that\u2019s perfect to dip the bread in.\n\nOther highlights include nasi dagang (made with a heirloom red rice grown for 3,000 years by the Lun Bawang tribe in Sarawak) that is anointed with coconut and ginger scallion oil, and served with coral trout on percik, a Malaysian barbecue sauce. Served alongside: chutney and herb sambal, with sides of chayote (a green squash) and a cucumber-coconut salad, altogether offering sweet, savoury and umami flavours all at once. \u201cIt\u2019s like in south-east Asian homes where, when we eat, we have a lot of side dishes,\u201d Wong adds.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t have a sweet tooth, make space for dessert: the Borneo raw-sugar bahulu, a traditional Malay pastry, baked in handmade brassware from the Malaysian state of Terengganu, is delightful and cannot be missed.\n\nMalaysian culture is thoughtfully integrated into Seroja\u2019s space \u2014 an art installation by the entrance is inspired by ketupat, which Wong explains is a local way of making rice cakes. Just behind, the Seroja signage on the hostess\u2019s podium is inspired by wayang kulit, a regional folk art of shadow puppetry. The ceiling above the chefs\u2019 counter (which is where one should aim to sit to take in the action in the kitchen) is an illustration of the Malay Archipelago.\n\nIn addition to providing a platform for Malay farmers, fishers and artists, Seroja uses a compost garden and has built a rooftop garden-farm where they source their tropical vegetables and herbs. They also collect and recycle rainwater.\n\nMalcolm Lee\u2019s Candlenut is the world\u2019s first Peranakan restaurant to receive a Michelin star, and has held on to this distinction since 2016, the year the guide made its debut in Singapore. He has long championed his Peranakan heritage (also referred to as Straits Chinese: generally a person of mixed Chinese and Malay/Indonesian lineage) in various iterations, from the ah-ma-kase menu (a play on the words omakase and ah-ma, which means \u201cgrandmother\u201d in Hokkien) at Candlenut to his favourite ingredient, the poisonous fruit of the buah keluak tree (which is made edible by fermentation).\n\nHis latest venue, Pangium, opened last year at the Singapore Botanic Gardens\u2019 eight-hectare Gallop Extension. Here he serves tasting menus on minimalist ceramics that celebrate contemporary Straits cuisine, which he describes as \u201cthe food our forebears first created with the knowledge, ingredients and tools they had on hand upon sailing down south-east Asia in search of a better life\u201d.\n\nThe menu during my last visit was themed to the Lunar New Year \u2014 an ode to the Chinese migrants who made Singapore home. Pang susi, the Eurasian sweet potato bun, was filled with Iberico pork cheek, though as a pescatarian I enjoyed a version with turmeric blue swimmer crab curry, its sugary crust giving way to a beautiful sweet and savoury finish. Buah keluak was mixed into a wok-fried rice with lobster and free-range eggs, lending to an earthy, umami-laden dish. Fish moolie, a dish believed to have originated in Kerala, was served here with toothfish (a type of sea bass) and scallops.\n\nThe multi-course menu changes every three months, and Lee says they are tied to \u201cthe whole vision of exploring and rediscovering Straits cuisine\u201d \u2014 for the most recent one, he \u201clooked at old recipes and stories, like a salad recipe from a 1960s cookbook called laksa siam\u201d.\n\nDining here at lunchtime offers serene 180-degree views overlooking the Unesco World Heritage site, with the feeling of being in a treehouse in the middle of a forest \u2014 although in the evening, the minimalist space can be romantic (tables are generously spaced out, too).\n\nChinese-Malaysian Zor Tan, who grew up in Malaysia, used to be known as the lauded chef Andr\u00e9 Chiang\u2019s right hand, having worked alongside him at Restaurant Andr\u00e9 in Singapore, Raw in Taipei and Sichuan Moon in Macau.\n\nIn June 2022, after working with Chiang for 11 years, Tan finally opened his own venture, Born, in the former Jinrikisha station, a heritage building. It has one of the most stunning dining rooms in the country, with an eye-catching paper sculpture by Dutch artist Peter Gentenaar hanging from the ceiling.\n\nHere, Tan serves what he calls \u201ccontemporary\u201d cuisine inspired by his childhood memories, professional journey and personal ideas. His menu is made up of nine courses that span the \u201cCircle of Life\u201d, based on the Chinese philosophy that what comes to an end will restart again.\n\nEach dish \u2014 rooted in Chinese ingredients (from his Hokkien ancestry to Cantonese, Sichuan, and Taiwanese influences from his work and lived experiences) \u2014 is prepared dexterously with classic technique in an exciting interplay of flavours.\n\nOn the menu that I had, the taro puff, for instance, is based on the gula Melaka (palm sugar originating from the state of Malacca in Malaysia) puffs his mother used to make while he was growing up. At Born, it is a savoury snack, deep-fried taro with a molten salted egg custard centre, topped with grated bottarga. He relates this to \u201cvicissitude\u201d, or how his family has progressed from humble beginnings through the years. His signature dish, monkfish, steamed and finished over binchotan (Japanese oak-wood charcoal) is served with fermented imperial chilli, jade fungus from the Yunnan mountains and Sichuan peppers, is a tribute to his time living and working in Macau.\n\nDessert came in the form of toasted rice cream, topped with milk ice cream, puffed rice, chestnut pur\u00e9e, and black garlic and sable \u2014 Tan\u2019s take on the classic Mont Blanc dessert, inspired by how rice is often the last dish at Chinese celebratory dinners.\n\nThe amuse-bouches at Nae:um were presented in an adorable way: kim mari (fried seaweed roll), yuzu tomato and Korean fried cauliflower centred around figurines of a boy and girl kissing on a picnic. I must have taken 20 photos from every angle as I decided which one to post on Instagram.\n\nLittle did I know that was just the beginning of an artful tasting menu (even the actual menu itself features a watercolour illustration) where each dish was as striking as the other. South Korea-born chef-patron Louis Han calls his contemporary tasting menus \u201cEpisodes\u201d \u2014 compendiums of his memories of growing up in Seoul (and, in the future, of his time spent abroad), each of which runs for six months. Han worked in kitchens in Lebanon (where he volunteered to serve with the UN Peacekeeping force) and Abu Dhabi before coming to Singapore, and working at chef Sun Kim\u2019s Meta and Kimme restaurants.\n\nWhen I dined at the blond-wood 28-seat space, the theme was the Han river, which chef Han says \u201cbrings everyone together in Korea\u201d \u2014 hence those picnicking figurines. Other standouts included sliced striped jack (white travelly) and kimchi draped over thin buckwheat noodles; a beautiful milssam roll, with prawns delicately encased in a Korean crepe; deopbap rice with black truffle, morels and mushrooms; and kkul hotteok (Korean sweet pancakes), served with glutinous rice, honeycomb and caramelised fig.\n\nLocated in a shophouse, Lolla has been around since 2012. It used to be a Spanish tapas restaurant, but in 2020 had a refresh when Philippine-born Johanne Siy became head chef. Siy had stints at La Bernardin and Caf\u00e9 Boulud in New York, Faviken in Sweden and Noma in Copenhagen, and worked with Andr\u00e9 Chiang at Restaurant Andr\u00e9, each influencing her style of cooking. While her culinary training is modern European, she draws much of her inspiration from her Filipino heritage. \u201cRather than doing a take on a complete dish, I take elements which capture the essence of the dish and incorporate them into my cuisine,\u201d Siy explains.\n\nFor instance, Siy\u2019s signature avocado dish is inspired by kinilaw, the Filipino \u201cceviche\u201d. \u201cI wanted to create a bright dish that\u2019s reminiscent of kinilaw from back home \u2014 lots of acidity, brightness and complexity to get the appetite going,\u201d Siy says. While there are other interpretations of kinilaw at Lolla, with different souring agents, aromatics and spices, with this one \u201cthere\u2019s acid in the form of citrus, heat from chillies, freshness from cucumber and richness from coconut milk\u201d.\n\nAnother signature, the crab relleno, is Siy\u2019s take on the stuffed crab dishes usually served at fiestas and gatherings in the Philippines, taken to the next level. She uses three kinds of crab \u2014 blue, snow and river \u2014 tied together with one of her favourite ingredients from the Philippines, aligue, an umami-rich paste made from crab tomalley (or crab \u201croe\u201d) gathered from small river crabs. This velvety, bright orange indulgence is layered above a bed of pearl couscous, and topped with smoked paprika foam, Kaffir lime and mustard flowers to balance the richness.\n\n\u201cI get a lot of comments from diners that even if the dishes don\u2019t necessarily look Filipino, the flavour profiles are Filipino,\u201d she says. On the \u00e0 la carte menu, Lolla offers the classic Filipino dish of adobo, with charred smoky quail served with a distilled vinegar-soy sauce and an egg-yolk confit, which sometimes makes an appearance on the tasting menu.\u00a0It is not to be missed.\n\nWhich Singapore restaurant in your opinion is best for mod-Sin?

The long wait time is deterring some potential clients.\n\n\u201cFamily offices remain popular, but we are seeing a slowdown,\u201d said Kia Meng Loh, co-head of private wealth and family office practices at Dentons Rodyk. He said the number of inquiries from wealthy families and individuals had declined from two to three a week to \u201ctwo to three per month\u201d.\n\nThe delays varied, however, with some clients who applied last year still waiting for approval, while others who applied in January this year receiving the green light as soon as August, he added.\n\nThat disparity points to growing regulatory concern that the vehicles could be used by criminal enterprises, lawyers in the city-state said. Private banking clients have also faced longer wait times to open accounts due to tighter due diligence, the Financial Times previously reported.\n\nSingapore was rocked by the revelation in August of a S$2.8bn (US$2bn) money-laundering scandal, as police seized assets including luxury properties, cars, designer handbags, gold bars, cash and cryptocurrency in raids across the city-state. Ten individuals, all of whom originated in mainland China, have been arrested and charged.\n\nInvestigators are examining whether part of those funds found their way into family offices and whether they benefited from tax incentives for the vehicles.\n\n\u201cIf you are from certain jurisdictions, I was told recently to expect a waiting period of 18 months. But it can be less than that,\u201d said one Singapore-based lawyer who asked not to be named. \u201cI think everyone now is being more cautious after the money laundering investigation.\u201d\n\nSingapore\u2019s government has encouraged the opening of family offices as it seeks a competitive edge over Hong Kong, seeking wealthy investors from around the world. The city-state\u2019s financial regulator calculated that family offices held about S$90bn in assets at the end of 2021.\n\n\u201cThe family office regime is very important for Singapore as a finance and asset management hub, and the government has put a lot of work into expanding and finessing it,\u201d said Sudip Baniya, business development director for private wealth at IQ-EQ.\n\nBaniya confirmed the slowdown in family office registrations this year, mostly from the greater China region, but said it was \u201cnot a drastic decline\u201d. While some cases had been waiting for 18 months, more often it was closer to 12 months, depending on the complexity of the application, he said.\n\nThe MAS began to impose additional restrictions on family offices in July, including setting a minimum fund size of S$20mn. At least S$200,000 must be invested annually in local businesses such as start-ups or the stock market.\n\nIt also required family offices to hire two investment professionals, at least one of whom comes from outside the client family, and has proposed additional measures such as hiring an MAS-regulated financial institution to check for money laundering.\n\n\u201cMAS continues to receive a high volume of applications for tax incentives by Single Family Offices (SFOs).\u00a0 They are generally processed in 9-12 months upon submission of complete information and supporting documents that are in good order but may take longer depending on the complexity and merits of each case,\u201d MAS said.\n\n\u201cThe screening process by MAS has also lengthened in view of the more stringent criteria for tax incentives announced in 2022 and 2023 and greater scrutiny following the money laundering arrests in August 2023,\u201d it added.\n\nRyan Lin, a director at Bayfront Law, added he had seen a 20 to 30 per cent slowdown in deal flow from clients. \u201cMost [family offices] are putting cash in money market funds and fixed deposits to wait for opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\nLoh of Dentons Rodyk said under the new criteria, more family offices were pursuing deals in areas such as private equity and there might be a \u201cnatural culling\u201d of the number of family offices in the coming months.\n\n\u201cSome wealthy individuals may decide putting money in a high-interest private bank account is better than spending $200,000 each year,\u201d he said.\n\n", "tag": "singapore?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6df7c15d-2733-4178-8207-1ccc11b84018"}, {"uuid4": "c31e7509-d955-49d8-9dfc-0191bd367f2e", "title": "Singapore opens the door to a shrinking market", "description": "Plus, the bleak future facing crypto post-Sam Bankman-Fried", "author": "Scott Chipolina", "published_date": "2023-11-17T13:00:05.025Z", "content": "Hello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week we\u2019re taking a look at a potential new crypto arms race\n\nSingapore has given blockchain firm Paxos an in-principle green light to issue a stablecoin \u2014 a kind of crypto token pegged to a hard currency.\n\nThe firm plans to launch the cryptocurrency through its new Singaporean entity. It will be pegged to the US dollar and fully backed one for one by the dollar and cash equivalents.\n\nClose followers of the crypto sector will remember Paxos as the issuer behind BUSD, the Binance-branded stablecoin that has faded to near-irrelevancy ever since falling foul of New York regulators earlier this year.\n\nNevertheless the Paxos approval marks a potential change of fortune for the crypto sector\u2019s record in Singapore, after the collapse of several high-profile projects in the city state, including crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and stablecoin operator Terraform Labs.\n\nSingapore state-owned investor Temasek was also forced to write off its $275mn stake in former industry bellwether FTX after the exchange\u2019s famous collapse into bankruptcy a year ago. Temasek has said its trust in FTX\u2019s former chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried \u2014 now convicted of fraud and other charges \u2014 appeared \u201cmisplaced\u201d.\n\nReaders of this newsletter will know that the UK has already laid its stablecoin cards on the table, setting out guidelines to regulate the digital tokens in a bid to try to facilitate their use as a payment option for everyday goods and services.\n\nSo Singapore\u2019s fresh embrace of a key digital assets market one week later might lead you to believe the international stablecoin arms race is heating up, especially as the large shadow cast by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and its crypto crackdown appears to be here to stay.\n\nWhile it\u2019s tempting to suggest that the US\u2019s actions on crypto open the door for the sector to boom elsewhere, the available data doesn\u2019t seem to back up the claim.\n\nThere is little compelling evidence to suggest demand exists for dollar-pegged stablecoins in Singapore, or even in Asia as a whole.\n\nIdentifying the parts of the world where stablecoin interest is highest is a challenge: crypto traders often use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to disguise their location from the prying eyes of regulators or governments that don\u2019t take kindly to crypto trading.\n\nInterest in the market can still be gauged by measuring the largest trading pairs between the world\u2019s sovereign currencies and largest stablecoins. If, for example, one of the top fiat trading pairs for Tether \u2014 the world\u2019s largest dollar-pegged token \u2014 is the Singaporean dollar, it would be fair to deduce that traders from the city state represent one of the stablecoin\u2019s most popular markets.\n\nBut, according to numbers provided by industry data platform CCData, the top five trading pairs for Tether\u2019s USDT token are the US dollar and the euro, followed by the Turkish lira, Thai baht and the British pound.\n\nThe outlook for Singapore\u2019s stablecoin push doesn\u2019t improve when you look at Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, the second-largest token of its kind with roughly $24bn circulating in the market. Predictably, the US dollar and the euro lead the way, trailed this time by the pound, baht and the Australian dollar.\n\nOther notable stablecoins include DAI \u2014 an algorithmic cryptocurrency much like the failed Terra token of 2022 \u2014 and BUSD, which, despite hemorrhaging market share since its issuance was banned by the New York State Department of Financial Services, still remains the fifth-largest stablecoin in the market.\n\nSignificant trading pairs for these tokens again offer little encouragement for a city state trying to reassert its grip on crypto markets: the Korean won, Brazilian real and Mexican peso all make notable entries for these tokens, while the Singaporean dollar is nowhere to be seen.\n\nPaxos\u2019s push into Singapore, according to Paxos\u2019s head of strategy Walter Hessert, is fueled by its ambition to \u201copen the financial system to everyone, introducing significant opportunities to global markets and billions of users\u201d.\n\nBut since its $188bn peak in April last year, the stablecoin market cap has fallen roughly 33 per cent to $126bn today. So while Paxos tries to break new ground in Singapore, it is doing so in a market that is not expanding.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on Singapore\u2019s most recent crypto moves? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nDuring a congressional hearing on illicit activity in the digital assets industry, president of consulting firm Dynamic Securities Analytics, Alison Jimenez, said US legislation aimed at reeling in the crypto sector may not protect consumers against bad actors in the space.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s foray into the crypto space continued this week after the world\u2019s largest asset manager filed with the SEC for a spot ethereum exchange traded fund.\n\nThe price of ether jumped modestly as a result, but you might also recall when the price of bitcoin surged a few weeks ago on inaccurate reports that BlackRock\u2019s application for another spot ETF tracking bitcoin had been approved by the SEC.\n\nThis week, the speculative nature of the crypto market was seen again when yet another faked filing hit the crypto market, this time for a iShares XRP Trust registered in Delaware. A BlackRock representative told the FT it had not filed for an XRP Trust, but the price of the XRP briefly surged nonetheless.\n\nFT Cryptofinance is this week edited by Laurence Fletcher.

So, actually, that is quite a good place for investors to double down on,\u201d he said in an interview with the Financial Times. Valuations of start-ups with AI business models were \u201ctoo high\u201d, he added. \u201cWe need to be careful not to get sucked into the hype. But it is more important not to lose interest.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI companies, whose technology can create imagery to order and humanlike text in seconds, have raised billions of dollars this year. Major tech companies have predicted that AI will drive their revenues, with Microsoft taking an early lead in incorporating it into its products, helped by its large stake in ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nGIC, which manages Singapore\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, does not detail its investments or break down its portfolio by sector, but it does so by region. Its investments in the US rose to 38 per cent of its portfolio for the 12 months to March this year, against 37 per cent a year earlier, compared with a dip in Asia, excluding Japan, from 25 per cent to 23 per cent.\n\nBut it was one of the earliest institutional and sovereign investors to embrace tech, in an attempt to keep the tiny financial hub abreast of the latest innovations.\n\nOf GIC\u2019s $52bn invested in listed companies, $17.4bn is in the tech hardware and semiconductor sector, according to Bloomberg data. Its biggest current holdings in listed tech companies are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ($11.1bn), DoorDash ($2.1bn), Sony ($1.56bn) and MediaTek ($1.25bn). This does not capture all of GIC\u2019s investments in public equities, which make up 30 per cent of the fund\u2019s more than $700bn portfolio.\n\nCompanies in its AI portfolio include UK analytics group Quantexa; Hong Kong data company MioTech; US AI software and hardware provider SambaNova Systems; and US-Israeli fintech Pagaya Technologies.\n\nBoth GIC, as well as Singapore\u2019s other state investor Temasek, have described AI\u2019s potential as transformative for business.\n\nBut the frenzy since the launch of the ChatGPT chatbot a year ago has prompted warnings from experts that most start-ups in the sector are overvalued and will fail to make money. AI has similarly stretched the market caps of big tech companies, with trillions added to their collective valuations since last year.\n\nVenture capital firms and larger investors, including sovereign wealth funds, have watched from the sidelines as Big Tech has forged deeper relationships with the top generative AI start-ups. This year, Microsoft has invested billions of dollars more into OpenAI and backed rival Inflection. Alphabet and Amazon have committed up to $6bn to Anthropic.\n\nThe companies have been preferred partners because only they can provide the combination of computing power and capital required to build foundation models. In turn, they have received preferential access to AI tools, and are expected to recoup much of their investment from AI start-ups\u2019 spending on their cloud services.\n\nInfrastructure is another important area for investors, including GIC. \u201cWe believe there will be an infrastructure layer for AI the same way there was for the transition to the cloud,\u201d said its chief.\n\nAmazon, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet have boosted investment in cloud computing infrastructure over the past few years. Bank of America analysts predict that the collective cloud-related capex of the three will rise at an accelerated 22 per cent next year to $116bn.\n\nSingapore has taken a more collaborative approach with AI to date, rather than seeking to regulate it. In an annual letter in July on GIC\u2019s performance, Lim warned that there were legitimate concerns that generative AI was being developed too quickly. He cited deepfakes, fake news and cyber attacks.\n\n\u201cDifferent investors have different ways of cutting the [AI] value chain, but\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009whatever way we cut [it], we have to remember that it is a long game,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by George Hammond in San Francisco and Mary McDougall in London", "tag": "singapore?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c399caf5-ff3b-4e7d-b295-4f0bbcc7184c"}, {"uuid4": "2b2cd467-b469-48c6-89b7-33e1592401a3", "title": "Asia\u2019s universities attract the next generation wealthy", "description": "Parents are looking to Hong Kong and Singapore\u2019s top ranked institutions ", "author": "Chan Ho-him", "published_date": "2023-11-07T15:20:24.226Z", "content": "Wealthy Asian families are increasingly sending their younger generations to study at homegrown universities, as the region\u2019s powerful economies present greater opportunities for business connections \u2014 and business expansion.\n\nWhere once rich dynasties favoured American and European establishments for their children\u2019s undergraduate and postgraduate studies, advisers report that many are now opting for the highly-ranked universities in mainland China, Hong Kong and the wider Asia Pacific region.\n\n\u201cThere is definitely a growing interest and trend for Asia to become a preferred destination for higher education,\u201d says Winnie Qian Peng, director of the Roger King Center for Asian Family Business and Family Office at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, Asia was far behind the US. Now it\u2019s not,\u201d Peng explains. \u201cIt\u2019s therefore very natural that people would view Asia as a good place to study and to work, because that could be the future growth driver.\u201d\n\nWhile the traditionally leading universities of the US and UK are still highly sought after by many wealthy Chinese families, for both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, Peng says a growing number of rich mainland Chinese families want their children to study at institutions in the region because they have become highly rated internationally.\n\nHong Kong is home to five of the world\u2019s top 100 universities according to the latest edition of QS\u2019s world university rankings, including HKUST, while mainland China has another five, including Tsinghua and Peking universities. Singapore has two in the top 100: the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University.\n\nPeng points out that the number of applications for HKUST\u2019s Master of Science in Finance programme this year was double the pre-pandemic level \u2014 with many now coming from mainland China.\n\n\u201cYou may find people with similar backgrounds from all those wealthy families, children studying together and becoming classmates,\u201d she says. \u201cThis becomes guanxi \u2014 a connection \u2014 people actually value this a lot, especially in the Asian context.\u201d\n\nUS-China tensions, which made it more difficult for some mainland Chinese students to apply to study in the US, have prompted more to look to Hong Kong and Singapore. Japan and South Korea\u2019s universities are also gaining momentum, Peng adds.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s low tax rates are a further attraction for global families. Meanwhile, Singapore remains a hotspot following an influx of Chinese investors during the pandemic \u2014 even though the city-state recently doubled its property tax for foreigners. It is particularly appealing to wealthy Chinese families who wish their second and third generations to gain overseas residency and passports.\n\nChi-man Kwan, chief executive of Raffles Family Office, a multi-family office dually based in Hong Kong and Singapore, says that, when it comes to deciding on a higher education destination, many wealthy parents will factor in where their family businesses are based, and where they plan to expand their business footprint.\n\n\u201cIf I am an entrepreneur in Greater China, and I am looking to expand to south-east Asia, the best place to make my headquarters is very likely Singapore,\u201d Kwan says. \u201cIf you are a European family or an American family, [and] your family business is doing very well\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009eventually \u2014 maybe this generation but for sure the next generation \u2014 Asia and Greater China is definitely going to play a big part of it.\u201d\n\nWealth managers in the region say that setting up a family trust is usually the best way of facilitating, and financing, a cross-border university move. Family trusts are well suited to planning for a student\u2019s life abroad in Asia, they argue, because they can be registered in Hong Kong or Singapore where there is a low tax regime, or registered offshore where tax can be mitigated further.\n\nTrust structures domiciled either overseas or in the region are especially beneficial if a child \u201cintends to stay in, or even relocate to, the place where he or she is studying\u201d, says Rita Ku, partner at Rita Ku & Ser, a Hong Kong-based law firm focusing on family law and wealth management. They can be set up \u201cif the parent is wealthy enough\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and they just want to set aside a certain big lump sum for the benefit of the child\u201d, she says.\n\nFor example, in the case of families that do not already have a footprint in mainland China but want their next generations to study there, a trust set up in Hong Kong may be an efficient solution, Ku explains. Not only is the territory close to large cities such as Beijing, but there are also multiple tax benefits in Hong Kong that are not available in mainland China.\n\nEasier pathways to residency and citizenship in Hong Kong and Singapore have been an additional factor for many rich Chinese families, she says.\n\nCarol Wu, head of private bank for North Asia at DBS, suggests that rich families who are looking to pave the way for their children to emigrate to Asia could go further and consider setting up a family office in the region \u2014 on top of having offshore trust structures.\n\nMany are already doing so. Eric Landolt, global co-head of family advisory, art and collecting at UBS, says the Swiss bank has seen \u201cmore interest\u201d from wealthy families outside Asia in setting up family offices in Hong Kong and Singapore. And, in some cases, the families are relocating and bringing their children to Asia with them.\n\nHowever, early planning is important if a wealthy family is looking to send its next generation to Asia for an education and a career after that, says Annie Koh, professor emeritus of finance (practice) Lee Kong Chian School of Business at Singapore Management University.\n\n\u201cThere are stages to getting residency \u2014 through graduating from a degree programme to\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009working in a company willing to sponsor your employment pass and eventually your residency,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u201cMany current generations understand there is a process and the earlier that the children start the integration process, the better.\u201d\n\n", "tag": "singapore?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5fa25922-0c09-462a-9a9b-8a97185aba0e"}, {"uuid4": "4a39857b-9219-47d6-93bc-06b4d9c68152", "title": "Governments need to become more productive", "description": "A smarter and leaner public sector is essential amid tight budgets and rising demands", "author": "The editorial board", "published_date": "2023-10-29T11:00:24.615Z", "content": "Travelling abroad can often spur bouts of \u201ce-envy\u201d \u2014 or jealousy over the digital ease of life elsewhere. Whether it is the ability to file a tax form in a click or to renew a passport via a smartphone, business leaders and tourists get an insight into how their government might drain less of their time back home. Immense pressures on the public sector, however, come not only from disgruntled citizens. With debts elevated and demands on public spending growing, governments across the world must work out how they can deliver more, with less.\n\nThe public sector already plays a prominent role in advanced economies. It employs around one in five workers while general government spending accounts for 40 per cent of gross domestic product on average. This gives it a significant bearing on national productivity. Ageing populations, climate change, and national security challenges are meanwhile bringing additional burdens on the state. Indeed, with tight budgets and rising debt interest payments, it is now even more essential that tax and spend decisions are not wasteful, and that governments find ways to become more productive.\n\nDefining what public sector productivity means is part of the challenge. It is often equated with cutting jobs or shifting resources from lower priority departments. But this comes at a cost \u2014 dilapidated infrastructure, longer healthcare waiting lists, and administrative blunders. Instead, governments need to work smarter, both in identifying and eliminating waste, and also by extracting more \u2014 and higher quality \u2014 from their existing resources. For measure, research by McKinsey estimates that operational improvements could save the US government $750bn per annum, without reducing the effectiveness of services.\n\nLeveraging technology \u2014 for instance by digitising paperwork, using data to generate policy insights, and automating tasks \u2014 offers most promise for boosting long-term efficiency and quality. Many nations have already made strides in e-governance, with Scandinavia leading the way, according to UN rankings. Estonia\u2019s e-Tax system sends pre-filled tax forms to be checked and filed within minutes. In Singapore registering a company online can take just 15 minutes. Indeed, digital governance can streamline staffing needs, smooth compliance processes, and raise the productivity of the private sector \u2014 small businesses can lose a few working weeks per year grappling with regulation.\n\nThe reams of data collected by governments can also be cleaned and analysed to unearth inefficiencies, improve services, and even raise revenues, particularly with the aid of artificial intelligence. America\u2019s Internal Revenue Service, for example, recently announced plans to use AI to collect unpaid taxes. In Britain\u2019s NHS, the auto-generation of cumbersome patient forms could free up time for nurses and clinicians, while machine learning could also help hospitals to manage capacity better.\n\nDitching outdated technology \u2014 particularly fax machines, which are shockingly still used by some governments \u2014 for existing best practice is a no-brainer. Adopting newer gadgetry may have an upfront cost, but it can bring significant long-term efficiency gains. Broader operational improvements can also come through developing and attracting talent better, boosting partnerships with the private sector, and encouraging innovation and experimentation.\n\nRevamping vast bureaucratic machines while they are operating is not easy. Governments have to balance the more effective use of technology and data with privacy concerns, cyber security risks, and regulation. The skillsets to manage transformation can be lacking too. These challenges need to be overcome. The cost of not doing so means an ever-growing strain on public services, and ongoing pressure to raise taxes. In the meantime, envious travellers can at least help prod governments into action.", "tag": "singapore?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/01cd8915-0fff-48b3-b927-135a63714e89"}, {"uuid4": "f822a9d0-fa21-440e-b295-86a037122f5f", "title": "Private equity firms face worst year for exiting investments in a decade", "description": "Amount buyout groups have made selling portfolio companies is running at lowest level since 2013 ", "author": "Ivan Levingston", "published_date": "2023-10-22T04:00:44.948Z", "content": "Private equity firms are facing the worst year in a decade for selling portfolio companies after higher interest rates and geopolitical tensions ended the buyout industry\u2019s boom.\n\nIn the first nine months of the year, buyout firms generated $584bn from either selling companies outright or through taking them public, according to data from PitchBook.\n\nThe amount is more than $100bn shy of what the industry raised during the same period last year and almost two-thirds below the record $1.4tn generated in 2021, when borrowing costs were low and US equities still in a bull market.\n\nHigher interest rates have hammered the market for initial public offerings and made companies wary of making acquisitions.

The gorgeous, flamboyant fiction of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Julio Cort\u00e1zar came to Calcutta street bookshops via the late Gregory Rabassa\u2019s superb translations from Spanish to English; my grandmother first read out the Mahabharata to me in Kaliprasanna Singha\u2019s Bengali translation from the original Sanskrit.\n\nI played hopscotch with languages as a child, skipping between Bengali, English, Hindi, grazing alongside French, Spanish, Sanskrit. Translators ferried us from the banks of one language to another, bringing Malayalam writers into Hindi, Pushkin or Isabel Allende into Bengali. A poor translation could kill your love for a book stone-dead; a good translation breathed fresh life into the works of beloved writers. \u201cTo translate a book is to enter into a relationship with it, to approach and accompany it, to know it intimately, word by word, and to enjoy the comfort of its company in return,\u201d author and translator Jhumpa Lahiri wrote in Translating Myself and Others (2022).\n\nBut will translation remain human for much longer? The debates over AI and machine translation have been fiery this year. A month ago, Veen Bosch & Keuning \u2014 the largest publisher in the Netherlands \u2014 announced plans to experiment with AI translation for a limited number of commercial fiction titles. Industry giant HarperCollins asked authors for permission to use \u201cselect nonfiction backlist titles\u201d to train AI Language Learning Models (LLMs) for Microsoft. There is a widespread fear that these AI models may one day make authors \u2014 and translators \u2014 obsolete.\n\nMy own preference is strongly for human translations, but AI enthusiasts argue that not all human translations are phenomenal, and that a poor translation can kill a novel or a collection of poems. Human translation takes time and can be expensive for publishers; the promise of AI is that it might \u2014 if LLM models advance in the right direction \u2014 open up a whole new world of literature to readers, instantly. Even for publishers who prefer to keep more creative writing in the hands of a human expert, the temptation to use AI translations for textbooks and bare-bones non-fiction is likely to be irresistible.\n\nIn January 2024, the Society of Authors ran a survey, asking their 11,500 members (authors, illustrators and translators) for their views on the impact of generative AI on creative careers. The results speak to both the promise and threat of AI translations: more than a third of translators (37 per cent) polled said they had experimented with generative AI, 36 per cent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI, and 77 per cent believed that machine translation would negatively impact their income.\n\nCan LLMs and machines translate as intuitively as a human? Despite machine \u201challucinations\u201d, where generative AI produces false or misleading responses, and other early glitches, AI translation will improve, and will probably be adopted across the corporate world. This threat to the livelihood of creative translators comes at a time when there are more translation prizes, and greater appreciation of the work that they do \u2014 visible, and invisible. AI treats translation like a crossword or logic puzzle, looking for one correct answer. Some of the skills that translators possess \u2014 creativity, deft selection, an understanding of authorial intent \u2014 are purely human acts. And as ambassadors for authors and books, no AI model could hope to replace the figure of the translator.\n\nThe translator\u2019s role so often extends beyond the text. Jennifer Croft, who translates works from Polish, Ukrainian and Argentine Spanish into English, spent almost a decade pitching Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s 2007 novel, the Man Booker International winner Flights, to publishers. \u201cI am often the person who also sells those books, acting as a kind of agent for the authors I\u2019m translating,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s an aspect of translation that I think most people are not aware of.\u201d\n\nTranslators are writers, and translation is an act intimately tied to emotion, imagination, bodily experience. Charles Simic, the Serbian-American poet who died in 2023, told the Library of Congress that translation was \u201can act of love, an act of supreme empathy\u201d; to Daisy Rockwell, another star translator of authors such as Upendranath Ashk and Geetanjali Shree, the translator and the author are \u201cballroom dancers\u201d. And Idra Novey felt, when she was translating the Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector, \u201cas if I were placing my palms against her palms and could hear the beat of her sentences matching my own\u201d.\n\nNone of us can wish generative AI away, and there are plenty of fields where it might be a timesaver, a boon. But publishers must reflect on whether AI translations have any place in our creative lives. Back in 2011, the legendary translator Margaret Jull Costa said, \u201cEvery translator will produce a different version, because every reader or listener reads and listens differently.\u201d The miracle of a good translation, to her, was that it was \u201cas seductively fresh and original as the original.\u201d That is what I and other readers respond to so strongly; the dance between author and translator, one palm pressed against the other.\n\nJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Caf\u00e9 and subscribe to our podcast Life and Art wherever you listen", "tag": "india?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3dffda06-6fc9-4b7e-8f1c-ffdca20917af"}, {"uuid4": "c70762ba-c7e0-4acf-83e3-246ae7c61598", "title": "India central bank cuts growth forecast", "description": "RBI holds rates and says economy has bottomed out", "author": "Krishn Kaushik", "published_date": "2024-12-06T09:12:10.954Z", "content": "India\u2019s central bank on Friday sharply cut its growth forecast for this year, confirming a slowing trend in what has been one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies.\n\nBut the Reserve Bank of India kept its benchmark policy interest rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent, citing an unexpected increase in inflation, and said the economy was showing signs of bottoming out.\n\nThe RBI said it now estimated growth for the 2024-25 financial year would be 6.6 per cent, compared with a previous estimate of 7.2 per cent.\n\nIts downgrade to expectations came a week after India announced GDP growth of 5.4 per cent year on year for the quarter to the end of September, the weakest performance in nearly two years.\n\nIndia\u2019s recent record of strong economic growth has underpinned support for Narendra Modi, who won a third term as prime minister in June. Modi has vowed to invest in more infrastructure and attract more foreign manufacturers to continue to drive the economy.\n\nSome analysts had expected the RBI could decide to cut interest rates to boost the economy, after keeping the benchmark repo rate at 6.5 per cent since early 2023.\n\nHowever the central bank said it remained concerned about inflation, which in October surged above 6 per cent, outside its 4-6 per cent target band.\n\n\u201cInflation has to be brought down in the interest of sustainable growth,\u201d RBI governor Shaktikanta Das told a press conference.\n\nGrowth in the second quarter of the financial year \u201cturned out to be much lower than anticipated\u201d, led by a slowdown in industry, he said in an earlier statement accompanying the rates decision.\n\nHowever, he added that indicators suggested that a slowdown in domestic economic activity had bottomed out and that industrial activity \u201cis expected to normalise and recover\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe second half of this year looks better than the first half,\u201d Das said, explaining that elections this year had probably affected government expenditure.\n\nIndia remained \u201cwell placed\u201d to deal with any spillovers from emerging global shocks, Das told the Financial Times this month.\n\nExperts had expected the RBI to revise its growth projections, as India\u2019s economy has shown signs of cooling in recent months, amid a slowing of consumption among urban Indians, an outflow of some portfolio capital, and a sluggish trend in private investment.\n\n\u201cEven though we see sequential improvement from here, we are still sceptical whether we are looking at a secular uptick in the growth story in India,\u201d said Madhavi Arora, chief economist with Emkay Global in Mumbai. \u201cAnd thus we remain much lower than the RBI in terms\u00a0of our growth forecast, at 6 per cent.\u201d\n\nAnalysts agree that the pace of growth should be better in the second half of the fiscal year.\n\n\u201cWhat the RBI has rightly pointed out is that growth has been depressed mainly because of the manufacturing sector, but oil and steel have shown signs of a turnaround,\u201d said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, which forecasts India\u2019s growth will reach 6.6 to 6.8 per cent this financial year.", "tag": "india?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7ebf0eb2-b41b-44c4-bd43-b15afba38667"}, {"uuid4": "f5e10b51-5725-4132-974f-5128dd66bf4a", "title": "The solar saga behind US bribery allegations against Gautam Adani ", "description": "Charges against Indian tycoon follow a troubled government effort to boost renewable power ", "author": "Leslie Hook", "published_date": "2024-12-03T05:00:16.347Z", "content": "Just three years ago, India\u2019s pledge to reach nearly 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030 made it a bright spot in the global solar industry. Now US corruption allegations centred on the country\u2019s biggest solar operator have cast a pall over a sector vital to its efforts to combat climate change.\n\nAround the same time that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was being feted for his ambitious targets at climate change talks in November 2021, Gautam Adani, billionaire head of the Adani Group, was allegedly involved in a huge bribery scheme to secure solar deals, according to US authorities.\n\nAdani and associates \u201coffered and promised\u201d bribes worth $265mn to Indian government officials in 2021, according to a US criminal indictment announced last month. It accused the 62-year-old Adani, who is widely seen as having close ties to Modi, of personally meeting a government official as part of efforts to \u201ccorruptly persuade\u201d authorities.\n\nThe allegations have highlighted the barriers to India\u2019s rapid solar sector expansion and raised questions about its ability to meet clean energy targets. Analysts and Modi opponents said they could constrain financing for future Indian solar projects, if foreign investors and creditors increased their risk premiums for lending or avoided Indian projects entirely.\n\nAs set out by the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the events that led to Adani allegedly resorting to bribery began about six years ago, when Indian policymakers were trying to encourage domestic solar panel manufacturing.\n\nIndia was seeking to transform itself into a clean energy superpower but government officials voiced concerns about its growing reliance on technology made in China, the world\u2019s largest producer of solar panels.\n\nTo tackle the problem, officials slapped tariffs on Chinese solar imports in 2018. Meanwhile the state-owned Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), which is tasked with pushing the industry forward, devised a solar power purchase tender with a twist.\n\nInterested companies would have to produce both electricity and solar panels, in the hope this would jump-start domestic production. The tender initially struggled to attract interest, with solar farm developers nervous about taking on risky manufacturing.\n\nBut after delays and revisions, in June 2020 two winners emerged: Adani Green Energy, the renewables division of the Adani Group; and Azure Power, a renewables developer headquartered in New Delhi and part-owned by Canadian pension fund Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nThe deals were transformative for the companies, covering up to 12GW of solar projects \u2014 enough for millions of homes \u2014 and capacity to produce 3GW of solar panels a year, combined. Analysts at the time said Adani Green would make \u201cmore than a billion\u201d in profit from the deals, according to the SEC complaint.\n\nThe optimism soon soured. In order to finalise the deals, SECI had to persuade state-owned regional electricity distributors to buy the power at the price the state corporation had agreed with Adani and Azure. Yet with market prices falling, distributors balked, and the deals stalled.\n\nThe agreed price of the electricity was unusually high because of the photovoltaic manufacturing requirement included in the deals. That structure proved so unwieldy that India never did a manufacturing-linked auction again. Adani Green eventually opened a solar manufacturing plant this year; Azure never did.\n\nAnother obstacle was that most of India\u2019s regional electricity distributors are under financial strain because they are forced to sell electricity below cost.\n\nAs months passed, with no final contracts signed with the regional distributors, executives at Adani Green and Azure resorted to corruption, US prosecutors alleged. They alleged the largest bribe of $228mn was offered to an official Gautam Adani met in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThe alleged scheme appeared to work: Between July and December 2021, several electricity distribution networks signed deals with SECI, including in Andhra Pradesh, allowing the state corporation to move ahead with its deals with Adani Green and Azure.\n\nIn December 2021 \u2014 a month after Modi\u2019s appearance at the Glasgow climate talks \u2014 Gautam Adani welcomed the finalising of the \u201cworld\u2019s largest green power purchase agreement\u201d of 4.6GW with SECI.\n\nToday, Adani Green is the biggest solar operator in India by operating capacity and reported net profits of Rs11bn ($130mn) for the year to March 31.\n\nBut the \u201crecord-setting\u201d solar awards at the heart of the alleged bribery scheme have not turned out as planned. None of the projects have yet been completed, according to consultancy Rystad Energy.\n\nIt took Adani until December 2023 to sell the last tranche of the power it was awarded in the 2020 auction. Azure still has about 2GW of the award unsold, according to SECI data.\n\nDevelopers across India are struggling to secure electricity sales contracts for renewables projects that have been awarded, stalling construction. About 10GW of this \u201cunsold\u201d capacity is hanging over the market.\n\nSushma Jagannath, Rystad\u2019s vice-president for renewables and power, said the Adani bribery allegations were likely to have a knock-on effect on the solar sector. \u201cThings like this can often discourage international players from investing in the Indian market,\u201d Jagannath said.\n\nSince the US allegations last month, TotalEnergies, Adani\u2019s biggest foreign partner on renewable and other energy projects, has suspended fresh investment in joint energy projects with the group.\n\nPawan Khera, head of communications for the Indian National Congress, the country\u2019s largest opposition party, said the allegations against Adani raised concerns that could \u201cimpact the quality and cost-effectiveness of solar projects in India\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny reputational damage or financial constraints faced by the conglomerate could cause significant setbacks in achieving India\u2019s climate goals,\u201d Khera added.\n\nAdani is one of a limited number of Indian groups able to execute big projects commensurate with the country\u2019s solar ambitions, said Rahul Tongia, senior fellow at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress, a think-tank.\n\n\u201cSome players have scale, some have manufacturing, some have better financing and global reach,\u201d Tongia said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t so many that have all of the above.\u201d\n\nAdani Group has called the US allegations \u201cbaseless\u201d and said it was seeking all \u201cpossible legal recourse\u201d. India\u2019s government has described the charges as \u201ca legal matter involving private firms and individuals and the US Department of Justice\u201d.\n\nIndia has made undeniable progress in renewable power. When Modi set a 2030 target of 500GW of non-fossil fuel capacity in Glasgow in 2021, the country had about 150GW, a level since increased to more than 200GW, according to government data.\n\nBut the sector has problems beyond alleged official corruption. Jagannath said an unprepared electricity grid and lack of long-distance transmission had become a bottleneck for renewables growth.\n\nEarlier this year, Modi\u2019s government quietly moved its target for reaching 500GW of non-fossil energy back two years to 2032.", "tag": "india?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e767eaba-1016-4380-96b3-bfcd1f6eaff1"}, {"uuid4": "f1100b0a-fa4c-4190-9a05-f99aa6bb90e3", "title": "Indian steelmaker JSW to launch own EV brand ", "description": "Company already has joint venture with China\u2019s SAIC in world\u2019s third-largest car market", "author": "Robin Harding", "published_date": "2024-12-02T05:00:05.599Z", "content": "JSW plans to launch its own electric vehicles brand, its chair and family owner Sajjan Jindal has said, signalling a move by the Indian steelmaker to become a significant player in the country\u2019s growing EV sector.\n\nJSW\u2019s plans for its own in-house EV brand follow\u00a0its announcement in March of a $1.5bn joint venture with SAIC Motor to build and sell the Chinese carmaker\u2019s MG-brand EVs in the world\u2019s most populous country and third-largest car market.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, Jindal said JSW\u2019s planned car plant in Aurangabad in India\u2019s western Maharashtra state would be devoted to its own brand, revealing for the first time an aim to build vehicles under its own name.\n\n\u201cOur idea is not to be an outpost of a Chinese company to sell products in India,\u201d Jindal told the FT. \u201cWe want to manufacture the products in India, value-add in India and sell in India.\u201d\n\nIn launching its own brand, JSW would be entering a field of EV makers in India that includes Tata Motors, Mahindra and Ola Electric.\n\nJindal gave no further details of his group\u2019s plans for investment or the specific vehicles to be produced. However, in a post on X in October, Aurangabad Industrial City, an industrial park in Maharashtra, welcomed JSW for what it said would be a Rs272bn ($3.2bn) investment set to make EVs and commercial vehicles and create 5,200 jobs.\n\nWhile sales of battery-powered two-wheel vehicles have soared in India in recent years with the help of subsidies, demand for full-size EVs has developed more slowly.\n\nThis contrasts with India\u2019s arch-rival China, where government subsidies and incentives for producers and buyers have prompted mass uptake.\n\nElectric car sales in India total only about 100,000 units a year, accounting for about 2 per cent of the passenger car market, according to S&P Global Mobility, but sales are starting to take off among more affluent Indians.\n\nMG Motor India in September launched its Windsor crossover EV, priced at about $17,000. According to the company the model is \u201cfully booked\u201d for the next few months, with\u00a0sales capped at 50,000 this year because its plant in Gujarat does not have capacity to produce more.\n\nNarendra Modi\u2019s government last year vetoed a proposal by China\u2019s BYD, which is vying with Tesla to become the world\u2019s top-selling EV brand, to set up a plant in Hyderabad in a JV with local company Megha Engineering. BYD recently set up a partnership in neighbouring Pakistan, where it aims to make EVs by 2026.\n\nModi\u2019s government in 2020 enforced some of Asia\u2019s strictest curbs on Chinese investment against the backdrop of fatal border clashes in the Himalayas, forcing companies from neighbouring countries to secure government approval to invest.\n\nSAIC entered the JV with JSW after finding that cash for its operation in India was \u201cnot coming through\u201d because of government controls, Jindal said.

Just ask All We Imagine As Light. In this luminous breakthrough from Indian director Payal Kapadia, the backdrop is Mumbai, rhapsodic under blue-black skies. Streets pulse, trains glow. \u201cEvenings are my favourite time of day,\u201d a voice remarks. \u201cIn Mumbai, it feels like the day has just begun.\u201d\n\nYet one of the intriguing things about this poised drama is that the first major character is exhausted by evening. She is Prabha (Kani Kusruti), a hospital nurse both mournful and steely.\n\nBut then, the whole film is subtly double-edged. One moment, Mumbai can feel like any other urban centre, all blank commuters and hanging cranes; the next, uniquely itself, with heat and rain as supporting characters. Kapadia\u2019s film won the Grand Prix at Cannes, and comes with classical arthouse flourishes: shades of 1950s Neo-Realism and 1960s New Wave. It also feels distinctly modern, popping with deep colour. The mood is melancholy: Prabha\u2019s husband has left her for Europe. Then it turns airy and jazzy.\n\nSome of that energy comes from a second female lead: brash hospital receptionist Anu (Divya Prabha), who is also Prabha\u2019s younger roommate. We first meet her telling a patient the state now offers 1,000 rupees and a bucket to any man willing to have a vasectomy. That detail sticks in the mind \u2014\u00a0but the vivid sense of character is more striking still. The film needs only tiny moments to bring alive Anu, the haunted Prabha and their semi-friendship, making them our focus even as it reminds us the city is home to endless other characters.\n\nTo underscore that, the voices of actual Mumbaikars sometimes overlay the scenes on screen, discussing what brought them here. (Typically, economics or heartbreak.) But the story too is rooted in the real. Anu has a secret Muslim boyfriend, perilous in contemporary India, while property developers upend a third heroine, hospital cook Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam).\n\nHer part in the film finally nudges it out of Mumbai, into coastal country.

There is an impressive collection of educational toys, testament to the aspiration of India\u2019s upwardly mobile middle class, and a wide selection of plastic tat, testament to the preferences of children everywhere. But at least half of these basic items, for sale in the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy, were manufactured not in India but in the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nFrom a Pinky the Pig plushie (designed in the UK, says the box, with a union jack on the front; country of origin \u2014 China, says the label, in small letters on the back) to a plastic lunchbox, it currently makes sense to produce these basic goods in China, with a per capita income of $12,614, pay any applicable tariffs, and ship them to India, where average incomes \u2014 and thus labour costs \u2014 are just one-fifth of that level at $2,485. This requires some explanation.\n\nWhat requires even more attention is corporate India\u2019s seeming lack of appetite to seize these markets: business investment is the missing part of the country\u2019s otherwise impressive growth story. While new capital formation is steady at about one-third of India\u2019s economy, driven by spending on housing and infrastructure, corporate fixed assets grew at just 5.5 per cent over the past year, well below the rate of expansion for the economy as a whole, according to figures from the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy.\n\nFor a long time, debt and underdevelopment seemed like the natural explanation for this sluggishness. In the wake of the global financial crisis, India suffered from a \u201ctwin balance sheet problem\u201d, with an overleveraged corporate sector struggling to service its loans, while banks, weighed down by non-performing assets, were reluctant to extend new credit. The lack of adequate infrastructure \u2014 roads, ports, water, electricity \u2014 created painful obstacles to industrial development of all kinds.\n\nTo its considerable credit, the government of Narendra Modi has tackled these issues. It has invested heavily in infrastructure, maintained budget discipline, and backed the Reserve Bank of India to control inflation and clean up the banks. Macroeconomically, India is now in good shape. With equity markets strong, credit available and an enormous tailwind from India\u2019s youthful demographics, there are no obvious constraints. Slow investment is about micro, not macro; about desire, not ability.\n\nOne potential reason for the lack of investment appetite in manufacturing is the extraordinary scale and competitiveness of China, which casts a long shadow over rich and poor countries alike. But the recent success of export-led growth in Vietnam and Bangladesh shows China cannot be the whole of the story. In garments and electronic assembly, they have gained from the desire to diversify supply chains, whereas India has not to the same extent.\n\nYet from the perspective of a small industrialist in India, who might invest in a toy factory, this is not so hard to understand. They face many hurdles. The government seems to favour large companies and advanced industries: it has offered tens of billions of dollars in so-called production-linked incentives to foster industries such as electronics and semiconductors, but these sectors are too far up the value chain for India to succeed easily, and will not create that many jobs if they do. Then there is the fear of India\u2019s largest conglomerates, which have pushed aggressively into the digital economy, and are widely believed to enjoy political favour. Giants such as Reliance, Tata and Adani are happy to invest. The problem is further down.\n\nSome businesspeople complain that the 2016 revision of the bankruptcy code is harsh and that bankers fear the punishment for non-performing loans too much to take a risk. In many parts of India, it is still costly to start or exit from a business due to labour and other laws. The ability to grow large without attracting a huge rival into the market and to limit downside when a business fails are both essential to entrepreneurs.\n\nIf a small industrialist wants to export, meanwhile, the hurdles are even higher. Most trade today is part of a global value chain, but from 2018 the Modi government began to raise tariffs, including on intermediate inputs such as printed circuit boards and displays. Regardless of whether this fosters domestic output of the protected goods, it makes India less competitive. According to the World Bank, India\u2019s backward participation in value chains, where its exports incorporate foreign inputs, fell from more than 25 per cent of total exports in 2010 to about 15 per cent by 2020. Meanwhile, India has few free trade deals with wealthy economies, yet competes with rivals that do. India\u2019s reluctance to join pan-Asian trade agreements and further open its economy to China is understandable. Bilateral trade deals with countries such as the UK, however, make sense.\n\nThe good news is that much of the hardest work has been done. Many of the obstacles to Indian industry do not require big expenditures or the most painful reforms; they mainly involve getting out of the way so the dynamism of India\u2019s young entrepreneurs can shine through. Do that, and \u201cMade in India\u201d can become as ubiquitous as \u201cMade in China\u201d is today.\n\nrobin.harding@ft.com", "tag": "india?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1acd08b1-7e78-477f-8bca-412037a2db6e"}, {"uuid4": "384d4320-5a3e-4102-ba49-05e920b525ae", "title": "\u2018Adios Adani!\u2019 Bribery charges threaten group\u2019s Africa ambitions", "description": "Kenya\u2019s reversal of support for airport project underlines global ramifications of US indictment", "author": "Andres Schipani", "published_date": "2024-11-27T05:00:38.662Z", "content": "For Nelson Amenya, Adani Group\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d attempt to take over Kenya\u2019s main airport in a $1.85bn leasing proposal was always \u201cone big red flag\u201d. Now, the MBA student who exposed the Indian conglomerate\u2019s proposal to run Nairobi\u2019s international airport for 30 years, feels vindicated after the plan became a casualty of US criminal charges against Gautam Adani.\u201cWe did it!!! Adios Adani!!!\u201d he said on social media after President William Ruto tore up $2.6bn in proposed deals with companies owned by one of India\u2019s richest men, who is accused by US prosecutors of involvement in a $265mn bribery scheme.\n\nRuto said in a televised address to the nation on Thursday that he had told officials to \u201cimmediately cancel\u201d the proposal for the Adani group to expand Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, as well as a $736mn investment in power lines.\n\nThe reversal of the Kenyan government\u2019s support for Adani\u2019s involvement in infrastructure projects was \u201cbased on new information provided by our investigative agencies and partner nations\u201d, he said.Kenya\u2019s decision underlined the global ramifications for Adani\u2019s companies after he was indicted for alleged securities fraud in connection with the alleged bribery scheme. It is another blow to the group just as it was seeking to rebuild its reputation after a short seller accused it of stock-price manipulation and fraud last year. Adani Group has said the US charges are \u201cbaseless\u201d.The plan for Adani to refurbish and run one of Africa\u2019s busiest travel hubs was part of a strategy to expand its presence on the continent, which had already led to it investing in a port and proposing a $900mn power lines project in Tanzania. Adani is also exploring projects in Morocco, Egypt and Zambia.\n\nBut it was the proposed arrangement with Kenya\u2019s aviation authority that thrust Adani into the spotlight as the country was also reeling from mass protests over tax increases. Local critics accused the company and the government of opacity in their dealings.\n\nFor Kenyan officials, the proposed deal was touted as a way to fix key infrastructure without adding to the country\u2019s debt, which takes up about 70 per cent of government revenue to service.\n\nBut when Amenya exposed the proposal, which was leaked to him by government officials in July, it sparked protests and an online campaign with hashtags\u00a0#stopadani and #rejectadani.\n\n\u201cKenya is in a tight spot and I think Adani took advantage of it,\u201d Amenya told the Financial Times.Even before last week\u2019s developments in the US, the problems in Kenya had led to the Adani group souring on its broader Africa expansion plans, which were also seen as key to India\u2019s geopolitical ambitions.\u201cIt\u2019s not worth it,\u201d said a person close to Adani. \u201cWe just walked into the middle of a brawl\u201d the person added, referring to the protests that forced Ruto to drop the proposed tax measures in June. Kenya\u2019s High Court had temporarily blocked the planned airport concession in September and last month the power line proposal between an Adani subsidiary and state-owned utility Ketraco.\n\nFaith Odhiambo, president of the Law Society of Kenya, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits that have stalled the projects, said the proposals were characterised by a lack of transparency.\n\nAmenya also criticised Adani for submitting a \u201cprivately initiated proposal\u201d for the airport concession, rather than competing in an open bidding process. However, the person close to Adani said it was Kenyan officials who raised the option of bypassing a tender process.\n\nThe plan was also controversial\u00a0with local activists because it did not oblige Adani to upgrade the existing runway until 2048 or to build a second one unless a jump in passenger traffic justifies the investment. That was despite the government having previously said this would be needed.They were also incensed by a clause that would have given the Indian company an 18 per cent equity stake in the airport even after the concession period had expired.\n\nLocal analysts also feared that a recent decision by Adani Power to cut electricity supplies to Bangladesh over an unpaid bill of $800mn could be the harbinger for Kenya if the country partners with the company to build power lines and power stations.\n\nThe Kenyan furore was just one sour note in Adani\u2019s patchy international strategy, which has seen his conglomerate set up port projects in Israel and Sri Lanka, while also courting neighbours such as Bhutan.\n\nIt pulled out of Myanmar last year following a military coup in 2021, while its ports and renewable project agreements in Sri Lanka fuelled local resentment and led the new government in Colombo to reconsider approving a wind project.\n\nAdani has expanded his businesses in tandem with development goals set by India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he has known since the premier\u2019s days as chief minister of their home state of Gujarat. Modi urged Indian corporates to become \u201cmultinational\u201d soon after taking office in 2014, although Adani has always denied receiving preferential treatment from the government. India sees opportunities for its companies from Africa\u2019s natural resources and growing population.\n\nDeals such as those being pursued by Adani can help India expand its influence despite lacking the financial firepower to compete with China in the global south, said Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, south Asia practice head at Eurasia Group. \u201cThere are almost no other companies in India with the scale or the capacity to build billion-dollar ports in far-flung parts of the world,\u201d Chaudhuri said.\n\nAdani only came to Kenya because officials in the country had invited the group to consider investing in the refurbishment of the port in Mombasa and to look at the country\u2019s transmission network, the person close to the company said. The airport project only came up later, they added.\u201cThe main problem with this Adani enterprise has to do with the process \u2014 it was never open and transparent,\u201d\u00a0said Moses Ndiema, secretary-general of Kenya\u2019s aviation workers union, whose members were among airport workers who went on strike in September chanting \u201cAdani must go\u201d.\n\nTheir wishes have come true and Amenya was showered with online accolades both in Kenya and India after Ruto\u2019s decision. \u201cAdani will fall soon!\u201d he said.\n\nThis article has been amended since publication to clarify that Gautam Adani was charged with alleged securities fraud", "tag": "india?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3694f5cf-8ad4-4d60-9ebf-f039456a74be"}, {"uuid4": "45c86d4f-9f50-41c8-a0cb-0e3c8bb7d0e2", "title": "Infosys chair bets companies will develop their own AI models", "description": "Nandan Nilekani says small language models trained on specific data are \u2018quite effective\u2019", "author": "Robin Harding", "published_date": "2024-11-27T05:00:38.521Z", "content": "Indian technology grandee Nandan Nilekani expects companies around the world will increasingly build their own smaller-scale artificial intelligence models to streamline operations and boost productivity, dampening hope of a substantial enterprise payday for more powerful generative products.\n\nThe chair of IT services major Infosys told the Financial Times he was \u201cnot so sure\u201d companies would want to shoulder the high costs and the potential \u201cblack box\u201d of data and copyright liabilities associated with large language models behind popular applications, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the large firms they\u2019re all saying: \u2018How do we take charge of our AI destiny?\u2019\u201d Nilekani said in an interview in Bengaluru, the Silicon Valley of India. \u201cSmall language models trained on very specific data are actually quite effective\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009everybody will build models, but I think they don\u2019t have to build these gigantic ones.\u201d\n\nNilekani said enterprise customers would call in LLMs for specific applications and the technology would fuel competition between the giants, such as Google and Apple, which offer online products to consumers.\n\nBut his prediction raises questions about the revenue model for start-ups that have invested in LLMs. Facing hesitation from businesses, the likes of Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft have all recently released AI models with fewer \u201cparameters\u201d \u2014 the number of variables used to train their systems and shape output.\n\nInfosys, the nearly $19bn annual revenue software and consulting business that Nilekani co-founded in 1981, is positioning itself to be an AI provider to the clients it serves across more than 50 countries, helping them to organise their data and train their own models.\n\nNilekani highlighted Infosys\u2019 company launch last month of two small language models in partnership with AI chip group Nvidia. They were trained on Infosys data and integrated in products such as its digital banking software Finacle.\n\n\u201cWe are actually offering a service to our clients to build a model\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009there\u2019s a lot of interest in that because we are demystifying this whole model-building stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole technology has become so easy that you can build models in a matter of months.\u201d\n\nSome analysts have raised concerns that India\u2019s outsourcing industry will suffer as more companies adopt technologically sophisticated AI models, with value flowing to software providers and the so-called hyperscalers of cloud services. If companies build their own models, however, then the technology will be an opportunity and not a threat for companies such as Infosys.\n\nNilekani, a fatherly figure of Indian tech who has been central to efforts shaping the government\u2019s digital policies and landmark Aadhaar biometric identity system, said AI would replace some functions in his country\u2019s tech industry \u2014 but new roles marshalling its power would crop up.\n\nThe Indian services sector has struggled with subdued growth and has slowed down hiring in recent years as customers, including Wall Street banks, cut back on IT spending.\n\nNilekani did not expect a large pick-up in headcount across India\u2019s tech services industry, which employs more than 5mn people. Partly because of advances in AI, but also due to a weak global economy, they \u201cmay not grow as they had grown in the past\u201d, he said.\n\nThe industry is one of India\u2019s few large sources of white-collar work in a country of 1.4bn people that is struggling to create meaningful jobs to soak up its young and vast labour force.\n\nAt the same time, the Infosys chair said Donald Trump\u2019s re-election might spur the industry, even though Indian IT companies were affected by his last crackdown on H-1B visas, which companies in the US use to bring in skilled foreign workers for a limited number of years.\n\n\u201cThe bull case is that this will unleash market deregulation, businesses will grow, people will do more acquisitions and therefore there will be more activity and therefore IT guys will benefit from it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy own sense is that they will probably support legal migration, which makes sense.

But distancing itself from one of India\u2019s richest men, and the business that flows from his sprawling infrastructure group, could have consequences too.\n\nIn a sign of the international impact of the US charges against Adani, French oil major TotalEnergies on Monday announced it had suspended fresh investments in joint projects with Adani Group, saying the conglomerate had not informed it of the corruption probe.\n\nLike Total, Jefferies continued to work with Adani after US short seller Hindenburg Research in January 2023 accused the group of stock manipulation and accounting fraud, allegations it has strenuously denied.\n\nExecutives at Jefferies internally debated whether it should keep Adani as a client in the wake of the Hindenburg report, according to people involved in the discussions. The bank was at the time acting as one of three lead managers on a planned $2.4bn Adani share offering, and made the controversial decision to press ahead with it even as international investors took stock of the group\u2019s financial position.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a client of Jefferies, questioned how banks involved in the equity offering could allow it to close without proper due diligence on the allegations made by Hindenburg. \u201cThere is just too much liability exposure for the banks,\u201d he wrote on X in late January last year.\n\nAdani chose to pull the offering after international investors largely withdrew their interest, but Jefferies had one foreign buyer lined up.\n\nIn March 2023, the bank brokered a deal in which Florida\u2019s GQG Partners ploughed $1.9bn into four Adani Group companies. On professional networking platform LinkedIn, Jefferies said it was \u201cpleased to have brokered a landmark transaction\u201d that would be \u201ca compelling long-term value investment\u201d for GQG.\n\nJefferies\u2019 relationship with Adani has helped the bank to expand quickly in India, a fast-growing market in which it has gone in a few years from being a small player to making more money in fees from advising on equity-raising than any other international bank.\n\nThe bank has leapt to second place in a fees league table, figures from Dealogic show, behind only India\u2019s ICICI. Last year, it was in eighth place and in 2019 as low as 32nd.\n\nTwo deals that helped propel it to second place were a $500mn Adani Enterprises share sale in October, and a $1bn Adani Energy Solutions fundraise in August.\n\nLast year Jefferies\u2019 investment banking fee revenue in India jumped to $44.9mn, close to four times the sum it had made in any year since at least 2014, figures from the London Stock Exchange Group show. So far this year, it has already topped that, with $57mn in fees. It is not clear how much of that revenue comes from Adani companies.\n\nAashish Agarwal, Jefferies\u2019 India country head, told the Financial Times last year the bank was \u201cdeeply focused on\u201d India, where it had undertaken 50 transactions in the past three years. \u201cSix to seven\u201d were for GQG, he said, including helping it buy stakes in Adani companies after the Hindenburg report.\n\n\u201cWe believe in partnering with our clients, in good times helping them to raise money, in tough times consolidating, whatever it requires,\u201d he said.\n\nJefferies is the only foreign bank to have advised Adani companies on equity issuance since the Hindenburg report, according to Dealogic figures, though the data provider cautioned that it did not have \u201cfull visibility\u201d because of Adani Group\u2019s complicated structure.\n\nSome European banks have worked for Adani on debt issuance since the Hindenburg report, though US-based groups have not. Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered were among the bookrunners when Adani Green Energy issued bonds in March. All three banks declined to comment.\n\nThe US indictments allege that Adani Green under its executive director Sagar Adani, Gautam Adani\u2019s nephew, engaged in a \u201clucrative\u201d bribery scheme to win Indian solar power supply contracts. They say the scheme was concealed from US investors and banks from which Adani and associates raised billions of dollars.\n\nJefferies\u2019 India business was listed as holding a 3 per cent stake in Adani Transmission as of June 2023, filings show, though it is not named in more recent filings. It is not clear whether the bank was holding the stake itself or on behalf of a client.\n\nJefferies initiated coverage on Adani Green in July with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating, largely based on the company\u2019s \u201cprudent capital management\u201d and its \u201cgame-changing\u201d project to build the largest solar plants in the world at Khavda in the Indian state of Gujarat.\n\nThe bank predicted Adani Green shares could shoot up by 75 per cent in a best-case scenario. After a sharp fall following news of the US charges, the shares traded on Tuesday down more than 45 per cent from the July 1 level.\n\nJefferies declined to comment on its relationship with the conglomerate or on the US charges against Adani. Adani Group has said the charges are \u201cbaseless\u201d and that \u201call possible legal recourse will be sought\u201d.\n\nAs recently as last month, a senior Jefferies executive was privately touting its relationship with Adani as a success. But a person close to Jefferies said it was not currently doing any work for Adani and any future business would be considered as and when it came in, an indication of the difficult line the bank is now trying to tread.\n\nThe bank has in the past offered public solidarity for Adani. \u201cOne year ago we began a business relationship with @gautam_adani. Today we are proud to be true partners,\u201d Jefferies chief executive Rich Handler posted on the social media platform X earlier this year.

But Trump\u2019s anticipated trade barriers could hit critical Indian export sectors, from drugs to IT services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different thing when you assume office,\u201d Das said, when asked about Trump\u2019s campaign pledge of blanket tariffs. \u201cEvery government the world over, when they impose tariffs they are fully mindful of what impact it will have on their domestic inflation.\u201d\n\nDas, whose second term expires before the year-end, is grappling at home with accelerating inflation, which breached the RBI\u2019s upper target threshold of 6 per cent in October on the back of rising food prices.\n\nGiven those pressures, many economists expect the RBI\u2019s monetary policy committee will hold its key interest rate at its meeting next month at 6.5 per cent, which would make it one of the few large central banks to not yet begin easing.\n\nThis month, India\u2019s trade minister argued that the RBI should cut rates to prioritise growth.\n\nDas said the RBI expected prices to begin moderating next month. He added that it was \u201cvery risky\u201d to give forward guidance on rates \u201cwith so many uncertainties all around\u201d, but noted that \u201cheadline inflation is our target and rightly so\u201d.\n\nIndia\u2019s economy and equity markets are also showing signs of cooling. A set of weak quarterly corporate earnings, and a slowdown in urban consumption, has helped fuel a foreign investor equity sell-off that has pushed benchmark indices into correction territory from their September peak.\n\nGoldman Sachs last week forecast that India\u2019s economic growth would slow to 6.3 per cent in 2025 from an estimated 6.7 per cent this year. The bank\u2019s analysts highlighted a 2 percentage point fall in bank credit growth in the third quarter to 14.4 per cent, after the RBI slammed the brakes on what Das called \u201cexuberance\u201d in unsecured lending.\n\nThe governor said India\u2019s economy was \u201ca mixed picture\u201d, but added there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that RBI measures over the past year to rein in retail credit, which was ballooning at a rate exceeding 25 per cent earlier this year, were the cause of a weak urban consumption.\n\nDas, who was appointed to helm the RBI in 2018, has been broadly praised for his stewardship of India\u2019s economy and his management of the rupee, which has remained largely stable thanks to regular central bank interventions in the market.\n\nIndian media have suggested that Das\u2019s mandate is likely to be extended, which would make him the longest-serving RBI governor since the 1960s.\n\nDas\u2019s reappointment would mean \u201cpolicy loosening is not on the cards for the time being\u201d, said Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, calling the RBI governor \u201cone of the more hawkish panel members in recent months\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat all said, there is growing evidence that the economy is cooling and we still think that inflation will drop back over the coming months,\u201d Shah added. \u201cThat will open the door for policy easing to begin in April, regardless of personnel.\u201d\n\nDas declined to comment on a potential extension of his term. \u201cI have a monetary policy [meeting] coming up, I think my mind is preoccupied,\u201d he said.", "tag": "india?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1afb3d71-53a5-4c4a-88af-ffa484cc1d6b"}, {"uuid4": "bb10e50a-e647-4e7e-8224-144f2af95a17", "title": "French oil major TotalEnergies suspends fresh investment in Adani joint ventures", "description": "Indian conglomerate releases report on operations after US indictment of founder Gautam Adani for alleged bribery", "author": "Jyotsna Singh", "published_date": "2024-11-25T06:14:22.289Z", "content": "French oil major TotalEnergies has suspended fresh investments in joint energy projects with the Adani Group and said the Indian conglomerate had not informed it of a US corruption probe even as the companies pursued deals together.\n\nUS authorities indicted the group\u2019s founder Gautam Adani in a bribery case last week.

To his alleged co-conspirators in a multibillion-dollar bribery scheme, he went by code names including \u201cNumero Uno\u2009\u201d.\n\nAsia\u2019s second-richest man was this week named in a criminal case filed by the US government that charged him with perpetrating a scheme to bribe Indian government officials in exchange for advantageous terms on solar power contracts that were set to yield more than $2bn in profits.\n\nThe US attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn charged Adani alongside seven defendants, including his nephew Sagar Adani \u2014 an executive at Adani Group subsidiary Adani Green Energy \u2014 and three former employees of large Canadian pension fund Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec (CDPQ).\n\nThe defendants allegedly agreed to pay more than $250mn in bribes to Indian officials between 2020 and 2024, in a plan concealed from the US investors and banks from which they raised billions of dollars.\n\nProsecutors claimed Adani himself met an official in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh to \u201cadvance\u201d the plan.\n\nThe charges against Adani include securities fraud, while others were charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which outlaws bribing foreign government officials.\n\nIt is one of the most high-profile cases pursued by the DoJ in recent years, crossing several jurisdictions and targeting a business magnate in ways that could have economic and diplomatic knock-on effects. It also raises the prospect of what could become fraught extradition proceedings.\n\nKevin Davis, professor at New York University School of Law, drew parallels with Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht, which was involved in Brazil\u2019s sprawling corruption investigation known as \u201cCar Wash\u201d and later agreed to pay the US and others multibillion-dollar penalties.\n\nIn that case, the DoJ did not pursue Odebrecht\u2019s former CEO, \u201cwhose stature in Brazil was comparable to Adani\u201d, Davis said. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting here is that the Americans are going after the individual\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but in terms of the economic and political ramifications, the proceeding is similar in scale\u201d.\n\nThe case comes just months before US president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House in January will usher in a new US attorney-general.\n\nDaniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor, said the timing of the charges may have been \u201can effort to get the nature of the charges out\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009before the change of administration\u201d.\n\nA new president \u201cmay cause those charges to be changed, withdrawn or otherwise impeded, but the allegations will still be out there and at the very least, the market and the public will have a sense of what the investigation has been about,\u201d Richman said. If the government were to drop the case, parties potentially hit by the alleged scheme could \u201cpursue their own remedies\u201d, he added.\n\nAdani earlier this month congratulated Trump on his electoral victory, pledging in a post on X to invest $10bn in US energy and infrastructure and to create up to 15,000 jobs. The billionaire is widely seen as having close ties with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who built a rapport with Trump during his first presidency.\n\nThe case follows accusations against the Adani Group of \u201cbrazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud\u201d levelled by short seller Hindenburg Research last year \u2014 wrongdoing that Adani has repeatedly denied.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has brought a parallel civil case against Adani, his nephew and Cyril Cabanes, a former CDPQ employee who served as an executive at Azure Power Global, a renewables company whose largest shareholder is the Canadian pension fund.\n\nA lawyer representing Cabanes in both cases declined to comment.\n\nFederal prosecutors alleged that three former CDPQ employees, including Cabanes, and others participated in an \u201cobstruction scheme\u201d to hide or provide false information to the US government and destroy documents.\n\nThey also allegedly turned on their co-defendants by revealing to US investigators that Adani and others were involved in a bribery scheme, while failing to disclose their own roles in the matter.\n\nThe DoJ and SEC allegations against directors of Adani Green were \u201cbaseless and denied\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[and] all possible legal recourse will be sought\u201d, the Adani Group said.\n\nCDPQ said it was \u201caware of charges filed in the US against certain former employees\u201d, who were terminated in 2023. \u201cCDPQ is co-operating with US authorities.\u201d\n\nThe former Azure directors and officers referenced in the charges had been \u201cseparated\u201d from it for more than a year, Azure said. \u201cWe have been co-operating with those agencies in relation to those and other matters and we will continue to do so,\u201d it added.\n\nThe cases appear to be underpinned at least in part by PowerPoint presentations and Excel spreadsheets that allegedly laid out options to pay the bribes and conceal them as a \u201cdevelopment fee\u201d or \u201ccommercial proposal\u201d.\n\nTracy Burnett, partner at Morrison Cohen, argued that the defence could seek to cast these documents in their favour.\n\n\u201cPotentially that is a way you could characterise the evidence, that it was so neatly recorded and memorialised that it was transparent,\u201d she said. \u201cOr the argument could be that they were transparent and that counts against the government\u2019s argument that they were knowingly\u201d breaking the law.\n\nThe filings revealed messages used to allegedly plot the scheme. Co-defendants referred to Adani under code names including the \u201cSuper Aggregator\u201d or \u201cthe big man\u201d, enforcers alleged.\n\nFor all the allegations in the complaints, prosecutors are still facing complex cases in which they will have to prove the requisite criminal intent.\n\nThere \u201cis a heightened standard\u201d under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, said Burnett. \u201cThe government needs to prove the defendants knew they were making corrupt payments, knew they were committing bad acts.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/23d5cbaa-7467-47d9-b794-75fa44782132"}, {"uuid4": "0ce62756-0b90-4fcf-a4f3-85d8bae4fdf4", "title": "The Great Mughals at the V&A \u2014 art, opulence and military power", "description": "The 400-year-old treasures of India\u2019s one-time rulers are still startlingly magnificent", "author": "Jan Dalley", "published_date": "2024-11-23T05:01:01.068Z", "content": "It was \u201cthe treasury of the world\u201d, according to Sir Thomas Roe, writing in 1614 to the future Charles I from Agra, where he was England\u2019s first ambassador to the Mughal emperor. The court whose wealth, splendour and culture so dazzled him was that of Jahangir, ruler over ever-expanding territories that stretched from the Himalayas almost to the tip of India. Alongside their political and economic power, Roe witnessed the range and depth of the Mughals\u2019 cultural achievements, with art forms from carpetmaking to jewellery, calligraphy, painting, weaponry, fabrics and more raised to a then unparalleled level of sophistication.\n\nJahangir is one of the three Mughal rulers in focus at the V&A\u2019s The Great Mughals: Art, Architecture and Opulence, which showcases this golden age of craftsmanship and artistry with a parade of startlingly magnificent objects and pictures.\n\nJahangir\u2019s father, Akbar, began his 50-year reign in 1556 and was, by all accounts, an exemplary monarch. Islamic invaders from the north-east, the Mughals had subjugated a largely Hindu population, yet Akbar ruled with surprising religious open-mindedness. He expanded and unified his empire not only through military campaigns but also diplomacy and economic cajolery, efficient bureaucracy and conciliation of his highly diverse conquered subjects.\n\nAnd he vigorously encouraged the arts. Paintings here reflect his ambitious building programmes but we also see his imperial workshops starting to produce luxury goods, textiles and carpets using stunning precious materials. Craftsmen came from across the empire \u2014 carpet makers from central Asia, mother-of-pearl inlay masters from Gujarat \u2014 but importantly from Iran. The Persian cultural influence is significant at every turn here, and its fusion with more local traditions, especially the Hindu, created what became a distinctive Mughal style.\n\nMost important to Akbar was his House of Books \u2014 perhaps oddly, since he could neither read nor write. Yet he built a library of incredible magnificence, judging from the elaborate and intricate calligraphic art on display here, much of it in Persian (the lingua franca of the court) and drawing on the skills of Iranian masters. The painting styles of Akbar\u2019s court show similar influence, but with a distinctive twist \u2014 one illustration from an 11th-century Persian epic shows a beautiful princess welcoming her lover by letting down her long hair for him to climb up. Above in the clouds, all is swirling fantasy and romance, but below in the real world the depiction of a garden with its watering system and the ducks on a pond is powerfully realistic.\n\nIn fact we glean information about everything from clothing, jewellery and meals to tilework and building techniques from the detail in the pictures here. And the growing extent of international cultural links that mirrored the political. Portuguese traders from Goa imported gemstones along with European thinking, and Akbar invited European craftsmen to teach foreign techniques such as enamelling on gold and silver, which quickly became established in the Mughal skillset. A glorious thumb ring, of gold set with rubies and emeralds and enamelled inside, is one of the almost impossibly intricate pieces shown here.\n\nThe working of nephrite jade was another imported material skill brought to stupendous heights in the Mughal courts \u2014 an example here is a small elegant wine jug (wine was clearly important throughout this period), made of shaped jade encrusted with gold, rubies and emeralds. It is jaw-droppingly pretty, the epitome of outrageous, just-because-we-can luxury.\n\nThere was export too: a hefty circular shield on display here is covered with tiny figures, horsemen and animals among elaborate foliage and patterning (another Persian style, razm o bazm, scenes of the hunt, feasts and war) tightly worked in glittering mother-of-pearl inlay, a masterpiece of metalwork and marquetry. Its chief interest, though, is that by 1599 it had found its way to Florence, in the armoury of Ferdinando of Medici \u2014 possibly a diplomatic gift?\n\nBy the time of Akbar\u2019s son Jahangir, who had a throne designed by a jeweller from Bordeaux, details in paintings show more and more cultural imports alongside the home production: Ottoman velvets, Chinese ceramics and brocades. Even exotic animals were cultural incomers: painters faithfully depicted a rather sad-looking zebra brought by emissaries from Ethiopia, a turkey cock from North America, every feather and wobbly wattle carefully defined.\n\nThis outreach to the world grew even further in the reign of the third king featured in this show, Jahangir\u2019s son Shah Jahan. Paintings show European traders carrying a box of Japanese lacquer, an emerald from Colombia; one intriguing image of a princely garden picnic includes wine poured from a Persian ceramic ewer into Venetian goblets, with Chinese porcelain on a Japanese table, while a guest sports a robe of Chinese brocade. Yet all this cultural input is melded into what is now, by the first decades of the 17th century, a firmly established Mughal style, one that had begun to astonish the world.\n\nShah Jahan took the throne in 1628, after a brutal campaign \u2014 despite the calm and elegance of royal imagery here, successions were a bloody business, chiefly brought about by murdering one\u2019s many competing brothers and cousins. Once installed on the throne, however, he presided over Mughal cultural life at its very peak and is best remembered, of course, for creating the Taj Mahal, mausoleum and loving tribute for his favourite wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th child.\n\nThe V&A\u2019s curators give surprisingly offhand treatment to Mughal art\u2019s most famous and enduring monument. A brief video, a model, some explanation of the calligraphy on the tombs\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that\u2019s about it. The wall texts do make the point, however, that the Taj Mahal\u2019s signature design, of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones to create multicoloured flowers and leaves delicately curling and twining, gave birth to a long stylistic history in Islamic art. (Even today: look at the pillars, walls and even the central courtyard of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, opened in 2007.)\n\nDuring Jahan\u2019s 30-year reign, the Mughal court became a magnet for foreign ambassadors and potentates and visitors of all sorts, drawn by its magnificence, its riches, its lucrative market opportunities. Under his rule, the arts flourished accordingly. So how does this story end? The empire still had a long way to go, after Jahan\u2019s son Aurangzeb seized power in 1658 while Jahan was ill, and initiated another 50-year reign. (Jahan recovered, but Aurangzeb imprisoned him for the rest of his life and clung on to the throne himself.)\n\nAlthough Aurangzeb expanded the Mughal empire to its furthest extent, a long decline set in. The V&A decides to fade us out of the Golden Age with Shah Jahan, bringing their glorious exhibition to a close while the going was good, but making the point that the artists and styles of these three magnificent courts, roughly 1560-1660, had an enduring legacy for centuries afterwards, throughout the subcontinent and the whole Islamic world, and beyond.\n\nTo May 5, 2025; vam.ac.uk\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FTWeekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life and Art wherever you listen", "tag": "india?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/28e21258-2067-4c4b-bc2d-0645336530fa"}, {"uuid4": "50cdfcfb-4620-48c0-a16b-e7366f21e970", "title": "Adani scandal will rock Indian market\u2019s coming of age", "description": "Turbulence draws fresh attention to risks and pricey valuations of local stocks", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2024-11-22T09:42:12.795Z", "content": "Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, once the world\u2019s third-richest man, has had a rough week in the markets. Bribery charges filed in the US knocked more than $25bn in value off Adani Group companies on Thursday. Shareholders in its 10 listed company stocks suffered. So might the international investors who have piled into the Indian market in recent months.\n\nThe sell-off in most Adani group stocks reversed on Friday, led by shares of Adani Enterprises, the holding company. But for the wider Indian market, this week\u2019s turbulence has drawn fresh attention to the risks and pricey valuations of local stocks.\n\nJust months ago, Indian stocks had been seen as a viable replacement for Chinese equities in global investor portfolios. Shares of Adani Enterprises had been one of the top performers, more than doubling from its low last year. Over the past year, shares had gained 30 per cent up until this week when the chair of Adani Group was indicted in New York in connection with an alleged scheme to bribe Indian officials in exchange for favourable solar power contracts. Adani has denied the allegations.\n\nThose types of gains have not been unusual in the local market. The broader benchmark has been on a four-year rally, more than tripling peak to trough \u2014 a period in which Chinese equities have been on a downward trend. Foreign investors shifting funds to India amid faltering growth in China have created a sense of the market\u2019s coming of age.\n\nThat shift can be seen in the net foreign capital inflows into Indian equities over the four years to this year, which surpassed $35bn. The figure hit a new record this year. A record number of new retail investor accounts joining the market helped fuel the rally, attracted by brisk economic growth in India.\n\nThat has also meant Indian stocks are getting pricey. The Nifty benchmark index trades at nearly four times book value, more than double that of broader emerging market indices. That is even after a fall of a tenth from its September peak.\n\nOn a forward earnings basis, the index trades at 25 times earnings, a premium of more than a third to the broader MSCI All-World index. Companies such as Adani Total Gas and Adani Green Energy trade at more than 90 times trailing earnings\n\nPanic selling of Adani group stocks is likely to be shortlived, as it was in 2023 following allegations of fraud, which Adani denied, made by US short seller Hindenburg Research. Shares of Adani Enterprises more than doubled in the year following the sell off. It will be more difficult to avoid being caught up in the market weakness if international investors rethink their affection for India.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com", "tag": "india?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2ab7f13e-347d-4e7a-b1f3-429c161b3ca8"}, {"uuid4": "24ff6be5-063b-4691-872b-400e0b659e6f", "title": "US indictment of Gautam Adani puts India Inc\u2019s reputation on trial", "description": "Alleged $265mn bribery scheme raises questions about the probity of Indian authorities and business leaders", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2024-11-22T03:49:22.131Z", "content": "Battling to win back credibility with investors after a damaging short seller attack last year, India\u2019s powerful Adani Group repeatedly flew business partners and journalists to its showpiece \u201cgreen\u201d project: a vast solar and wind farm in Khavda in the north-western state of Gujarat.\n\nNow Adani\u2019s renewable power business is itself at the heart of even more perilous allegations levelled against one of India\u2019s biggest conglomerates, a sprawling industrial powerhouse whose rise has shadowed the political ascent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for two and a half decades.\n\nUS criminal and civil charges accusing the group\u2019s founder Gautam Adani of involvement in a $265mn bribery scheme have startled Indian businesspeople and given potent ammunition to Modi\u2019s parliamentary opponents.\n\nFor international investors, they raise new questions about the probity and integrity of Indian regulators and business leaders, while casting doubts on the nation\u2019s preferred narrative of an ascending economy that offers a safe alternative to a corrupt and capricious China.\n\nThe charges from the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission could also complicate New Delhi\u2019s ties with Washington, which are already clouded by claims Indian officials were involved in attempts to kill Sikh separatists in the US and Canada.\n\nSince short seller Hindenburg Research last year accused the Adani Group of engaging in \u201cbrazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud\u201d, Modi\u2019s opponents have criticised the prime minister for what are widely seen as his close ties with billionaires including Adani.\n\nOn Thursday, many called on Indian authorities to follow the example of the US agencies and prosecute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now pretty clear and established in America that Mr Adani has broken both American law and Indian law,\u201d opposition leader Rahul Gandhi told a press conference in New Delhi.\n\n\u201cHe has been indicted in the United States and I\u2019m wondering why Mr Adani is still running around a free man in this country,\u201d said Gandhi, sitting in front of a large image of Adani and Modi sharing a laugh.\n\nA possible extradition request, legal appeals and long-running court proceedings could add an unpredictable twist to a fast-expanding but complex US-Indian diplomatic, military and trading relationship ahead of the inauguration of a new administration led by Donald Trump.\u00a0An extradition treaty between India and the US has been in force since 1999, but has only occasionally been used.\n\n\u201cThere is an arrest warrant that has been issued in the US,\u201d said Praveen Chakravarty, an official with Gandhi\u2019s Indian National Congress party. \u201cHow is that going to proceed? If the US calls for extradition, is Modi going to protect him [Adani], and on what grounds?\u201d\n\nGandhi and other opposition politicians pointed in particular at one section of the US criminal indictment. It alleges that in March Gautam Adani and his nephew Sagar Adani, executive director of the Adani Green renewables business, had \u201cmade or caused\u201d group personnel to falsely tell banks and India\u2019s two stock exchanges that it had not received notice from the US justice department of an investigation.\n\nChakravarty described the US allegation of misleading investors as a \u201cserious offence\u201d that would require action by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the stock market regulator.\n\nSebi has previously investigated the allegations made by Hindenburg and reports in the Financial Times and elsewhere alleging Adani manipulated its own shares, but has not taken any action against the group. In July, Sebi said Hindenburg Research had \u201cdeliberately sensationalised and distorted certain facts\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Mahua Moitra, another opposition MP who has been scathingly critical of Adani in parliament. \u201cLet\u2019s wait for this fraud and grand larceny to unravel.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s government spokesman and Sebi did not respond to requests for comment. The Adani Group has described the US charges as \u201cbaseless\u201d and said \u201call possible legal recourse will be sought\u201d.\n\nThe charges against Adani come at a time when India\u2019s reliability as a like-minded business and diplomatic partner for western democracies was already being questioned.\n\nCanada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said there are \u201ccredible allegations\u201d of Indian involvement in the killing of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Vancouver last year. The US last month charged an Indian \u201csenior field officer\u201d with directing a foiled plot to murder a Sikh activist in New York City.\n\nWhile India expelled Canada\u2019s diplomats and responded belligerently to Ottawa\u2019s claims of extrajudicial killing, it has been more circumspect with the US, whose officials have demanded accountability from their Indian counterparts.\n\n\u201cThus far, the United States and India have successfully compartmentalised the fallout from charges linked to India\u2019s \u2018murder-for-hire\u2019 scheme, but the charges against several high-ranking Adani executives will create a new source of tension,\u201d said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\u201cGiven that the charges are being brought in the middle of a presidential transition, I suspect there are already back-channel conversations taking place to implore the incoming Trump administration to drop the DoJ and SEC cases,\u201d Vaishnav said.\n\nSome Indian businesspeople speculated that fallout from the charges in India would be limited, with Modi\u2019s government likely to seek to shield a friendly business group pursuing projects central to the prime minister\u2019s infrastructure drive from prosecution both in India and the US.\n\nOne CEO, who asked not to be identified, suggested it would be unfair to judge all corporate India by a single case.\n\n\u201cMy instinct is that it hasn\u2019t hurt brand India or the credibility of the regulator or the ethos that you can build businesses in India that stand up and thrive and survive,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nIn a post on social media site X last week, Adani congratulated Trump on his election and said his group was committed to investing $10bn in US energy and infrastructure projects and was \u201caiming to create\u201d 15,000 jobs. The post was illustrated with an AI-generated panorama showing the US and Indian flags waving over a city with a port, railway and elevated highways.\n\nIf US-India relations \u201ccan survive a murder-for-hire allegation against New Delhi, then they can certainly survive this new revelation\u201d, said Michael Kugelman, director at the South Asia Institute of The Wilson Centre, a US think-tank. \u201cPresident-elect Trump may see Adani as an ally: a fellow businessman who has praised Trump, is close to Modi, and promises to invest in the US and create jobs.\u201d\n\n\u200bLetter in response to this article:\n\nAdani indictment raises questions over US bank\u00a0/\u00a0From Lee Jones, Professor, Queen Mary University of London, London E1, UK", "tag": "india?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3a285234-bada-400c-a119-9393c767181e"}, {"uuid4": "98cae711-f027-4d18-88bb-b07f87543171", "title": "Three Bank of America bankers in India depart over alleged client tips ", "description": "US bank conducting internal investigation into \u2018front running\u2019 of deals", "author": "Kaye Wiggins", "published_date": "2024-11-21T19:26:40.631Z", "content": "Three Bank of America dealmakers in India have left amid an ongoing investigation into allegations of wrongdoing in the US financial group\u2019s Asian unit, according to three sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe bankers resigned on Thursday and their departures were tied to the investigation, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe internal investigation, which was launched earlier this year following a whistleblower complaint, is probing whether BofA and bankers in its Asian operations had tipped off certain investors of upcoming secondary offerings, allowing those investors to \u201cfront run\u201d the stock sales and profit from non-public information.\n\nAt issue were meetings the bankers held with corporate executives and hedge funds prior to stock offerings, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

Adani Group said the accusations were \u201cbaseless and denied\u201d and added that it would seek \u201call possible legal recourse\u201d.\n\nNews of the charges sent share prices of Adani companies tumbling just as the group was emerging from a lengthy effort to deny the allegations made early in 2023 by Hindenburg Research, a New York short seller, and bolster confidence among lenders and investors. The Hindenburg report was itself a test for India Inc \u2014 but one which it ducked. The business and government establishment largely closed ranks around Adani Group, echoing its narrative that the short seller\u2019s report was a \u201ccalculated attack on India\u201d.\n\nThough the stock market regulator, Sebi, launched investigations, it has taken little action in response to Hindenburg\u2019s report and reporting by the Financial Times and others that alleged that Adani manipulated its own shares \u2014 which the group has vigorously denied. India did not seize the moment to debate whether its corporate governance standards and market controls were sufficiently robust for a global top-five economy which prides itself on being the world\u2019s largest democracy.\n\nThe country\u2019s political and business elite should treat seriously the accusations now emanating from US legal authorities, and ensure they are properly investigated domestically. While there may be irritation at perceived interference by overseas agencies, that is the price of tapping international investors. There are also important questions over why it is American law enforcement bodies rather than India\u2019s authorities that are pursuing this case.\n\nThe allegations, after all, go to the heart of how economic power in India is concentrated in politically-connected, family-run conglomerates \u2014 and investor concerns over \u201ccrony\u201d capitalism. Not only does Adani himself have long associations with the prime minister, who is also from Gujarat. His group, spanning ports and airports to mining and green power, is central to Modi\u2019s plans to build up India\u2019s infrastructure as the backbone of its further development. Doing so will rely on foreign investment, and investor confidence.\n\nAdvanced economies have issues with crony capitalism, too. Perhaps more than any recent predecessor, returning US president Donald Trump has surrounded himself with billionaire businesspeople competing for favour. But such models typically lead to suboptimal growth. The Modi government\u2019s bold ambitions will best be served by ensuring the emerging economic powerhouse has a sturdy and transparent regulatory and legal environment.", "tag": "india?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/100d2b66-52e0-4e40-b386-5418b9ccc968"}, {"uuid4": "7bd46d98-5fe8-4be1-b677-a9e4251cf0f4", "title": "\u2018Numero uno\u2019: US takes aim at Gautam Adani ", "description": "Criminal and civil charges against Indian tycoon and associates set out alleged $265mn bribery scheme", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2024-11-21T12:54:02.382Z", "content": "Visiting the US in March 2023, Sagar Adani, nephew of Indian billionaire tycoon Gautam Adani, was suddenly approached by FBI agents who seized his electronic devices as part of a sweeping probe into an alleged years-long kickback scheme involving an Adani group\u2019s renewables business.\n\nAlmost 20 months later, US authorities have unveiled bribery charges against Sagar, 30, and his uncle, a hugely influential business leader who is Asia\u2019s second-richest man and widely seen as having close ties to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe criminal and civil cases allege Adani family members and group leaders, along with former executives of Indian renewable company Azure Power and Canadian pension fund CDPQ, schemed to funnel $265mn in bribes to Indian officials to secure solar contracts. The scheme was allegedly concealed from US banks and investors from which Adani raised billions of dollars.\n\nGautam Adani, 62, personally met a senior government official three times in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh in 2021 as part of efforts to \u201ccorruptly persuade\u201d authorities to help seal power supply deals with electricity distribution companies, according to the criminal indictment.\n\nAt his conglomerate\u2019s headquarters in Ahmedabad, western India, the billionaire himself allegedly presented \u201cmultiple options\u201d for ways to conceal bribes.\n\nThe charges pose an unprecedented threat to the Adani Group, which had relaunched ambitious domestic and overseas expansion efforts following damaging separate allegations of corporate fraud levelled against it last year by short seller Hindenburg Research.\n\n\u201cThis is more serious than the Hindenburg report,\u201d said Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at The Fletcher School at Tufts University. \u201cThis will definitely make a dent in Adani\u2019s fundraising from international investors.\u201d\n\nAdani Group called the allegations \u201cbaseless\u201d and said it was seeking all \u201cpossible legal recourse\u201d. CDPQ, an Adani shareholder, said it was co-operating with US authorities and had sacked the named employees last year. Azure said the former executives referenced in the charges had been \u201cseparated\u201d from the company for more than a year and it was co-operating with the US agencies.\n\nAdani\u2019s nation-spanning conglomerate has built one of India\u2019s largest renewable businesses as Modi\u2019s government pushes ambitious plans to meet half its energy needs from green sources by 2030.\n\nThe indictments filed by the US attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn and the Securities and Exchange Commission allege the renewables business Adani Green under its executive director Sagar Adani engaged in a \u201clucrative\u201d bribery effort to win solar supply contracts with Indian government entities between 2020 and 2024.\n\nThese included a deal involving the state-owned Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) on the purchase of 7,000 megawatts of power-generating capacity in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nGautam and Sagar Adani, along with Adani Green managing director Vneet Jaain, as well as former Azure executives, conspired to \u201ccorruptly offer\u201d and authorise bribes to officials to gain energy contracts with state electricity companies from Andhra Pradesh to northern Kashmir, according to the criminal indictment.\n\nThe SEC alleged that the power purchase agreements were only executed by the state-owned solar company after the Adanis \u201cundertook a massive bribery scheme to incentivise Indian state government officials to enter into contracts with SECI to buy energy at above market rates\u201d.\n\nTo keep track of their arrangements, Sagar Adani used his mobile phone to share specific details of bribes offered to government officials, it said. Jaain photographed a document in April 2022 ahead of a meeting in New Delhi with a former Azure executive that summarised bribe amounts Adani would put forward, it said.\n\nA former Azure executive also prepared PowerPoint presentations and Excel spreadsheets to help the CDPQ executives analyse the best \u201ccorrupt payment option\u201d, the criminal indictment said.\n\nAccording to the criminal charges, some of the defendants used code names, calling Gautam Adani \u201cMr A\u201d, \u201cthe big man\u201d and \u201cNumero uno\u201d. They also referred to Jaain as \u201csnake\u201d or \u201cNumero uno minus one\u201d.\n\nAnother key charge levelled against the two Adanis and Jaain is that they provided \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d information about their involvement in instigating bribes as they travelled to the US to seek dollar funding from investors and financial institutions.\n\nProceeds from a dollar-bond issue in 2021 were directly linked to capital expenditure requirements for various projects, including one \u201ccorrupt\u201d scheme, according to the criminal indictment.\n\nThe SEC in its separate civil charge said Gautam and Sagar Adani had for years \u201cpositioned Adani Green to investors and the public as a leader among its peers and within India in principles of good corporate governance, highlighting Adani Green\u2019s purportedly rigorous anti-bribery and anti-corruption principles and policies\u201d.\n\nThey \u201cleveraged that narrative\u201d to sell almost $1bn of Adani Green bonds and notes to US investors in September 2021, it said.\n\nWhen the former Azure and CDPQ executives were approached by US authorities, the defendants sought to withhold \u201ckey information\u201d about the Indian graft efforts, according to the criminal charges. The charges said the executives made selective disclosures to investigators, revealing Adani\u2019s requests for bribes \u201cbut concealing their own participation\u201d.\n\nThe Azure and CDPQ executives allegedly deleted electronic messages and PowerPoint presentations, while in meetings during 2023 with the FBI and SEC they denied taking part in the Indian bribery efforts. \u201cThis strategy was designed to create the appearance that the co-conspirators were reporting misconduct rather than perpetrating misconduct.\u201d\n\nSoon after Sagar Adani was approached by the FBI last year, Gautam Adani \u201cemailed himself photographs of each page of the search warrant executed and grand jury subpoena served\u201d on his nephew, according to the criminal indictment, which alleges the tycoon concealed that information from investors and banks.\n\nProsecutors noted that the Adani Group said the conglomerate was \u201cunaware\u201d of any investigation against its chair following media reports this year that US probes against the tycoon were under way.\n\nThe group\u2019s head of corporate finance is also alleged to have sent more than a dozen emails in March 2024 to multiple investors and financial institutions stating the news was \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cmalicious\u201d.\n\nEarly on Thursday morning India time Adani Green suspended a $600mn bond issue planned for this week after news of the charges prompted a major sell-off across the conglomerate\u2019s 10 listed stocks.\n\nThe drop in Adani Group shares was \u201csimilar to the reaction\u201d following Hindenburg\u2019s damaging allegations last year, said Abhay Agarwal, founder and managing director of Mumbai-based fund manager Piper Serica Advisors. \u201cIf this impacts the group\u2019s ability to raise new capital to fund its projects it would be a huge negative.\u201d\n\nHowever, with Adani\u2019s strong backing at home and extensive control over much of India\u2019s critical infrastructure, Chakravorti at Tufts expects the billionaire \u201cto ride it out much as he did when the Hindenburg report hit\u201d even if it limits his travel outside India.\n\n\u201cWill he be extradited?

Adani Green said it would suspend a planned $600mn bond issue.\n\nCDPQ said: \u201cCDPQ is aware of charges filed in the US against certain former employees. Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is co-operating with US authorities. In light of the pending cases, we have no further comment at this time.\u201d\n\nAzure said former directors and officers of the company referenced in the charges by US authorities had been \u201cseparated\u201d from it for more than a year. \u201cWe have been co-operating with those agencies in relation to those and other matters and we will continue to do so,\u201d it said.\n\nGautam Adani has over the past two decades built his conglomerate into one of India\u2019s most formidable industrial groups, diversifying from its core ports and trading business into mining, airports, coal and renewable power.\n\nIt has built or bid for power, port and other infrastructure projects in countries including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Israel, where it operates the port of Haifa.\n\nIn a post on X congratulating Donald Trump on his US election victory earlier this month, Adani said his group was \u201ccommitted to leveraging its global expertise\u201d and would invest $10bn in American energy security and infrastructure projects as part of the partnership between India and the US, with the aim of creating up to 15,000 jobs.\n\nAdani\u2019s rise in business has coincided with India\u2019s drive to harness private-sector expertise and capital to develop its infrastructure, which has accelerated during Modi\u2019s decade in power.\n\nThe Indian National Congress party\u2019s Rahul Gandhi, who became India\u2019s opposition leader after this year\u2019s general election, called for an investigation after the Hindenburg allegations and questioned Adani\u2019s record of winning government tenders, as well as his close ties with ruling politicians including Modi, who is also from Gujarat.\n\nOn Thursday the party said the US indictment \u201cvindicates\u201d its demands for a parliamentary probe.

In this short timeframe, he went from being Asia\u2019s richest man to defending the business practices at his sprawling business empire.\n\nProblems started when short seller Hindenburg Research published a damaging report in January 2023, which alleged accounting fraud and stock market manipulation. Adani Group, which Adani chairs, vigorously denied the allegations and scrambled to shore up confidence with investors and banks.\n\nBut on Wednesday, those months-long efforts came crashing down. Adani and seven other business executives were charged by federal prosecutors in New York over an alleged years-long scheme to bribe Indian officials, in exchange for favourable terms on contracts, projected to bring in more than $2bn in profit.\n\nThe allegations are vast. Prosecutors said the tycoon made the payments in exchange for billions of dollars\u2019 worth of solar power contracts \u2014 and that those payments were concealed from US banks and investors.\n\nThe kickbacks in question aren\u2019t small either. Executives allegedly paid more than $250mn in bribes between 2020 and 2024 to Indian government officials as part of the scheme.\n\nIt was already well-known that Adani had close ties to the Indian government, as well as him being a vocal supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nSeven other executives were also charged, including managers at Adani energy subsidiaries and former employees of Canadian pension fund CDPQ. This was also a family affair: Gautam\u2019s nephew, Sagar Adani, was among the defendants.\n\nAdani was already in a public relations crisis.\n\nHindenburg\u2019s report had an immediate and devastating impact. A month after it came out, Adani Group had suffered a $145bn market sell-off. Adani himself suffered a personal blow, losing the title of Asia\u2019s richest man to Indian industrialist Mukesh Ambani.\n\nYet the charges from the Eastern District of New York are just one of the legal quagmires Adani will have to face.\n\nThere\u2019s a parallel civil lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said the scheme included having the Indian government commit to buying energy at above-market rates; that benefited Adani Green and Azure Power.\n\nIn October 2014, Stephen Schwarzman reminded Blackstone investors that he had some experience in spin-offs.\n\nYears earlier, an asset management group had been separated from the private equity firm and control had been ceded to an up-and-coming bond trader. That man was Larry Fink and the new firm became known as BlackRock.\n\nSchwarzman has once again struck gold, sending a Blackstone unit out into the world to find its fortune: this time that firm is PJT Partners, which was formed a decade ago as the cast-off of the former Blackstone deal advisory group.\n\nAnd its most crucial element would be its chief executive: the former Morgan Stanley rainmaker, Paul Taubman. After a huge increase in its share price since the depths of April 2020, PJT has hit a market capitalisation of $7bn.\n\nDD\u2019s Sujeet Indap and James Fontanella-Khan have crunched the numbers in securities filings and have scooped that Taubman\u2019s stake is now worth more than $1bn. Schwarzman, who got his PJT shares in the spin-off and is still the second-largest shareholder, holds shares worth more than $900mn.\n\nPJT at the moment is a big player in some of the fiercest boardroom battles. It has a role advising Boeing, Pfizer and the debt restructuring underpinning a Dish and DirectTV tie-up. The combination of Blackstone\u2019s strength in restructuring and private funds, along with Taubman\u2019s Rolodex, has proved formidable.\n\nTaubman, for his part, takes home a small sliver of what he\u2019s really worth. His salary is a mere $1mn, and his remaining pay comes simply in long-term stock grants that only vest if PJT shares go up.\n\nTaubman bet on himself. And the wager has so far paid off magnificently, both for him and his champion, Schwarzman.\n\nTo Dom or not to Dom, that is the question\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. at least if you\u2019re a billionaire with property interests in London.\n\nBritain\u2019s colonial era \u201cnon-dom\u201d rules have allowed the wealthy to shelter their overseas income and gains from UK tax, while still living \u2014 and spending \u2014 in London (or indeed their country estates).\n\nBut this convenient arrangement will end next year, under changes announced by the new Labour government. Wealthy \u201cnon-doms\u201d with one foot in the UK must now choose whether to pony up more tax, or sharply limit their time in the country to avoid taxable status.\n\nTheir predicament has prompted a great deal of hand wringing \u2014 not least in the real estate sector \u2014 about London\u2019s luxury economy and attractiveness to overseas investors.\n\nEnter Adar and Natasha Poonawalla \u2014 whose family company, the Serum Institute of India, manufactured millions of doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and who have invested tens of millions in research and production in the UK.\n\nThey own the second most expensive home in London, bought last year for \u00a3138mn.\n\nAdar told the FT earlier this year that the tax changes risked deterring investment, and would \u201cmake people stay away\u201d from the UK. But he also mentioned that his wife, Natasha, would probably put up with the loss of the tax benefits.\n\nHowever, in the same month as that interview, it appears as if she doubled down on the UK in a more tangible way. A company controlled by Natasha bought a \u00a342mn block on Grosvenor Square \u2014 formerly the Indonesian embassy \u2014 as a redevelopment opportunity.\n\nThe deal is a corrective to the worst fears about the impact of the non-dom changes to London\u2019s super prime market.\n\nBritish politics has at least since Brexit (and arguably since the Reformation) thrown up plenty of reasons for the global wealthy to stay away. But DD wouldn\u2019t count London out any time soon.\n\nOil \u2018wildcatters\u2019 Shale barons like North Dakota governor Doug Burgum and oil magnate Harold Hamm are thrilled about Republican plans to reshape the energy sector, the FT writes.

This then gets trapped by cooler air, giving the capital some of the world\u2019s foulest air.\n\nIn India pollution measured with an Air Quality Index of 400 or higher ranks as \u201csevere\u201d. Delhi\u2019s air monitoring stations cap readings at 500, but this week the AQI reached as high as\u00a01,743, according to the IQAir app. Even a few minutes outdoors leaves you feeling ill and gasping for breath.\n\nDuring the miasma, some of Delhi\u2019s rich retreat to their houses, where air purifiers offer some respite; others decamp for the cleaner climes of Himalayan hill stations. But the poor have to put up with the poison air as with so much else.\n\nOne of the sillier rituals of winter pollution season is the political blame game that accompanies it. Critics of Narendra Modi fault his government for failing to tackle a national health emergency that shortens lives, and which a 2019 study estimated was costing India 1 per cent annually in GDP.\u00a0Supporters blame the Aam Aadmi party, which runs local governments in Delhi and Punjab where much of the stubble burning happens.\n\nEnvironmentalists believe both sides miss the point. \u201cEnforcement and implementation of policy is where the big gap lies,\u201d says Mohit Beotra, CEO of the Air Pollution Action Group. \u201cBut it\u2019s also an opportunity: if someone at the top decided this was something they could address, they could chip away at the problem.\u201d\n\nWhat Indian media primly labels the \u201cwinter haze\u201d is a collective action problem. Activists believe it will need both large-scale individual action, government leadership \u2014 and ideally cross-border co-operation too.\n\nSome of the smog now blanketing Delhi comes from the brick kilns, factories and farms of Pakistan and as far afield as Afghanistan.\u00a0The wind in south Asia tends to blow from north-west to south-east, so the pollution will also carry on eastward to Bangladesh.\n\nChina, India\u2019s geopolitical rival, has succeeded in bringing down its worst air pollution levels over the past decade. But unlike India, with its decentralised, federal democracy, China is a one-party state where orders are issued at the top. India, say environmentalists, needs a more granular and co-operative approach.\n\n\u201cOne first step would be an air pollution conclave,\u201d says Bharati Chaturvedi, founder of environmental non-profit group Chintan. Smaller steps are also within reach. Municipal governments have so far undertaken theatrical but ineffective measures such as spraying water in the air or deploying mechanical road sweepers. Instead they could work more effectively on dust control or invest in public transport.\n\nTo aid overburdened officials, business should also step up.\u00a0\u201cYou need a high-level meeting with the top corporate heads in Mumbai where you can say: \u2018What can you take responsibility for?\u2019\u201d says Chaturvedi.\n\nOne key lies in enforcement: stubble burning, for example, is a punishable offence. Thermal power plants and dust-creating businesses like brick kilns and the stone-crushing industry need to be made to comply with legislation. Officials might also focus on measures such as repairing roads to ensure vehicles do not throw up dust. Garbage should not be dumped and burnt.\n\nIn Delhi and 12 other north Indian cities, a programme targeting \u201cdispersed sources\u201d of pollution uses surveyors contracted by municipal authorities to identify sources of dust or illegal waste dumping and act. An IIT Delhi study found a 15-26 per cent reduction in PM2.5 levels, a dangerous particulate matter which penetrates the bloodstream and lungs, in areas where it was implemented.\n\nIn the past, Indian governments have shown themselves willing to shoulder big projects, such as Modi\u2019s Swachh Bharat (\u201cClean India\u201d) campaign which built more than 100mn toilets.

The scheme would result in his family\u2019s expulsion and loss of his livelihood, Shakib said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one person who will benefit,\u201d he added.\n\nShakib\u2019s anger reflects growing concern in Dharavi over Adani\u2019s redevelopment plan, which is expected to displace an estimated 700,000 of the roughly 1mn people crammed into what is one of the world\u2019s most densely populated areas.\n\nAdani, a powerful tycoon widely thought to have close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, won a contract in 2022 to remake the roughly 600-acre slum, which sits on prime real estate in India\u2019s overcrowded financial capital in the western state of Maharashtra.\n\nBut Dharavi\u2019s future has become a political flashpoint ahead of state elections this week. Opposition parties trying to wrest back control of Maharashtra from an alliance led by Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party have vowed to scrap Adani\u2019s redevelopment contract, which they allege was wrongly awarded.\n\n\u201cThis government handed over Dharavi to Adani,\u201d Rahul Gandhi, India\u2019s most prominent opposition leader, told a rally last week. Gandhi has accused Modi of enriching cronies such as Adani, whose business interests have expanded in step with the prime minister\u2019s ambitious nation-building plans.\n\n\u201cThey got airports, ports, roads, and now they are getting Dharavi,\u201d Gandhi said.\n\nAdani has denied benefiting from government favouritism, and supporters of the project say that if it proceeds successfully it can become a global model for slum redevelopment.\n\nDharavi was the \u201cmost complex\u201d part of a wider overhaul of Mumbai\u2019s strained infrastructure, said one person familiar with the government plans for the revamp, which they estimated would take seven years or more and cost Adani at least $4bn.\n\n\u201cIf a man like Adani cannot do it, then I don\u2019t think anyone can in the same model,\u201d the person said.\n\nA migrant settlement on the fringes of colonial Bombay in the late 1800s, the area has been enveloped by Mumbai\u2019s explosive growth. Today it is just a stone\u2019s throw from the Bandra Kurla Complex, a modern business district home to banks, diplomatic missions and gleaming arts and convention centres owned by Mukesh Ambani, Asia\u2019s wealthiest businessman.\n\nBut Mumbai\u2019s reinvention has hardly touched Dharavi, the famous setting for the 2008 hit film Slumdog Millionaire.\n\nResistance from residents along with bureaucratic and political inertia has for decades stymied efforts to redevelop the area, a maze of brick and corrugated-iron shacks mixed with small workshops where workers toil to recycle plastics or churn out pottery or leather products.\n\nIn 2022, a BJP-led political alliance won control of Maharashtra\u2019s government and issued a new tender to remodel Dharavi after an earlier redevelopment deal was cancelled by the previous administration.\n\nAdani\u2019s conglomerate, which also runs Mumbai\u2019s airport and distributes electricity to the city, won the tender with a $619mn offer, more than 2.5 times the next highest bid. The group has an 80 per cent stake in the project, with the remainder held by the state.\n\nSeclink Technologies, a Dubai-based consortium that initially won the cancelled 2018 tender, has challenged the new contract, alleging in the High Court of Bombay that the process \u201cunlawfully\u201d favoured Adani by raising bidders\u2019 net worth requirements and limiting consortium members.\n\nThe Maharashtra government has said no contract had been agreed with Seclink, that a new tender was ordered because the financial and economic situation had been changed by factors including the coronavirus pandemic, and that the consortium was not excluded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a type of match fixing,\u201d said Raju Korde, a lawyer who grew up in the slum and is a founding member of the Save Dharavi Movement. \u201cWas this project for the rehabilitation and redevelopment of Dharavi or was it for making Adani more prosperous?\u201d\n\nAdani Group and the state authorities have denied any wrongdoing. The conglomerate and Maharashtra\u2019s Slum Rehabilitation Authority did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdani, who worked as a teenager in Mumbai\u2019s diamond trade in the late 1970s, wrote last year that he \u201cwas mesmerised by the industrious chaos that I saw in Dharavi\u2019s alleys\u201d and was inspired by \u201cthe community\u2019s struggle for survival\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen this opportunity to renew Dharavi came calling, I seized it with both hands,\u201d he wrote, promising to provide \u201celigible residents\u201d with gas, water, electricity, sanitation, recreational facilities and a \u201cworld-class hospital\u201d.\n\nA person close to Adani said the tycoon saw Dharavi as a legacy project. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to make us a lot of money,\u201d the person said. \u201c[The area] is more tightly packed than a can of sardines\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the challenge is incredible.\u201d\n\nBut the redevelopment master plan has yet to be made public and uncertainty is mounting among Dharavi residents.\n\nThe 2022 tender states that only households able to prove residency pre-2000 will be rehoused for free in a 350 sq ft apartment in the area.\n\nMany residents with documents proving their pre-2000 residence are keen to take up Adani\u2019s promise of more spacious new housing in the area.\n\n\u201cDevelopment is good,\u201d said Sheikh Shahin Banu, a 53-year-old widow who depends on her son\u2019s wage as a leather worker and wants to stay on in Dharavi. \u201cIt\u2019s centrally located\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009all of my relatives are here.\u201d\n\nFor the majority who like Mohammad Shakib face relocation, Maharashtra\u2019s government recently approved the acquisition of nearly 400 acres of land on a salt pan and garbage dump in Mumbai\u2019s north-eastern suburbs, an area that Vinod Shetty, a human rights lawyer, said was \u201cnot habitable\u201d.\n\nThe scheme was in effect \u201cwiping the slate clean\u201d in a valuable area near the BKC business district and then \u201chanding it over to somebody who\u2019s close to the government\u201d, Shetty said.\n\nAdani\u2019s surveys to verify residents\u2019 residency have \u201cmet with a lot of hostility\u201d, said the person close to the group, who also accused some people of falsifying documents to try to show they lived there before 2000.\n\nMany in Mumbai are deeply sceptical about Adani\u2019s intentions, including Shaikh Mobinuddin, a businessman who grew up in Dharavi and owns a number of shops there.\n\n\u201cHe will make people ineligible and the land will be resold to the Mumbai free market,\u201d Mobinuddin said.", "tag": "india?page=3", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9bafa390-bf42-4689-ab20-2566f732acef"}, {"uuid4": "e6194ef9-3896-4628-8c12-1290cafed14d", "title": "BrewDog shuts Mumbai bars in blow to India expansion plans", "description": "Supply problems and regulatory issues disrupt UK craft-beer maker\u2019s aim to open 100 outlets in the country", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2024-11-19T05:00:45.114Z", "content": "BrewDog, the UK\u2019s biggest craft beer brand, has closed its two flagship Mumbai bars, in a blow to its plans to scale up in the country and tap the growing number of drinkers.\n\nThe BrewDog bar in Bandra West, a suburb that is home to many Bollywood stars and is known for its liberal nightlife, as well as its bar in the office district of Lower Parel, have been closed since the summer.\n\nThe company\u2019s logos have also been taken down from the locked-up properties, according to checks by the Financial Times.

In a similar forecast this time last year, it predicted Britain would have 17GW of onshore wind, 31GW of offshore wind and 21GW of solar by 2030.\n\nLast year\u2019s figures for offshore wind and solar were lower than its new predictions, suggesting the government\u2019s policies will have made some difference.\n\nHowever, Cornwall cautioned that the forecasts were not directly comparable because of changes to the way it carried out its modelling.\n\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said it did \u201cnot recognise\u201d the forecasts, pointing to NESO analysis that showed \u201cclean power by 2030 is achievable\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are cleaning up a dysfunctional grid system to connect the most important projects, speeding up decisions on planning permission and expanding the renewable auction process to stop delays, unlocking growth\u201d.", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5d1451ac-ec64-4616-8ac9-36acd26f8939"}, {"uuid4": "5b06b45e-0663-4dd2-a643-ff675d6852ed", "title": "Kemi Badenoch\u2019s post-Southport argument is worrying", "description": "Tory seems to put prior convictions ahead of specific facts at a time of potential UK counter-terrorism strategy overhaul ", "author": "Georgina Quach", "published_date": "2025-01-27T09:30:44.747Z", "content": "Good morning. What should we be talking about in the wake of the Southport murders?\n\nOn Friday, I set out why Axel Rudakubana did not fit into either of the British state\u2019s models for dealing with people who might end committing crimes such as his. For people with specific mental illnesses, hopefully they end up being detained under the terms of the Mental Health Act. And for people who would kill for a cause, hopefully they are spotted by Prevent and dissuaded from supporting or committing terrorist acts. (Or they are stopped and arrested before carrying out a terrorist plot.)\n\nWhether the UK\u2019s approach to identifying and combating terrorism should change as a result, and if so how, are going to be a topic of serious debate over the coming days, weeks and months. We expect the imminent publication of the review into when Rudakubana came into contact with Prevent and what the counter-terrorism programme could have done differently. I will set out my thinking on it once I\u2019ve digested the report.\n\nFor now I want to talk about the arguments advanced by the leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch, that what we really should be talking about in the wake of these murders is \u201cintegration\u201d, partly because some of what she is missing is important to my concerns about the broader criticisms being made of the UK\u2019s Prevent programme. Some more on that below.\n\nAxel Rudakubana was born and raised in the UK. His parents, who were Tutsis who had left Rwanda before the genocide, were Christians (like 92 per cent of people in Rwanda). They were both churchgoers. As an 11-year-old, he appeared in a commercial for Children in Need dressed as Doctor Who. But as he entered his teenage years, something changed. He became obsessed with violence. He came into contact with various bits of the state, none of which spotted the danger that he posed.\n\nSo when Kemi Badenoch says \u201cit is absurd that we are debating online knife sales more than we are integration and how we safeguard our societies from ideologies and violence\u201d, it is hard, frankly, to see how that relates to this case.\n\nIn terms of the broader question of \u201chow do we keep British citizens safe from terror\u201d, yes. According to the most recent data release, there were 234 people in prison in Great Britain for terrorism-connected offences. Of those, 65 per cent are categorised as holding Islamist-extremist views, 27 per cent are categorised as following extreme rightwing ideologies. The remainder hold \u201cOther\u201d ideologies \u2014 mostly causes that have been the inspiration for terrorism in the recent past, such as animal rights. Their threat has, for the moment, been pretty comprehensively dismantled by counter-terrorism police and the security services.\n\nSafeguarding the UK from ideologically motivated terrorism is a much bigger deal and challenge than random acts of violence motivated by obsession with violence, at least at the moment. Identifying and tackling problems of ideology is both what Prevent is set up to do, but it is also how we distinguish between terrorism and all other forms of crime.\n\nAnd indeed, one important thing that we need to balance when we consider how and if the UK\u2019s approach to countering terror and extremism should change is whether any alterations would damage our efforts against these much larger threats. (That, and other topics, is the subject of a must-read piece by the UK\u2019s independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall, which you can read here.)\n\nBut in terms of the specifics of this case, no. Actually \u201cjust how hard should we make it for the rest of us to buy knives?\u201d is a relevant policy debate. \u201cWhat does the UK do well and badly in terms of integrating people into the country?\u201d isn\u2019t. Badenoch was pressed on the topic by the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg yesterday and she gave the following answer (emphasis mine):\n\nI am really not sure where Badenoch has got this idea from: Rudakubana had materials about genocides and atrocities, yes. The more than 164,000 pieces of material he had ranged from Gaza, to Grozny, to Iraq, to the genocide in Rwanda and the Holocaust. I suppose some of that could be categorised as \u201cwhite genocide\u201d but Badenoch seems to have unearthed a motive and a consistency to Rudakubana\u2019s interests that neither the Crown Prosecution Service nor the police have. (Over on Bluesky, Sunder Katwala offers a plausible theory as to the source of Badenoch\u2019s belief.)\n\nWhen pressed by Kuenssberg on where she had the evidence for her claims about integration, Badenoch responded:\n\nBut Badenoch\u2019s background is not similar to Rudakubana. She was born in the UK (in an era when being born in the UK still gave you an automatic right to citizenship) but she spent the first 16 years of her life in Nigeria. Rudakubana was born in the UK and grew up in the UK. These backgrounds are about as far apart as well, the 2,000 or so miles separating Nigeria from Rwanda.\n\nThis is part of what looks to be a pattern: that Badenoch does not familiarise herself with the particulars of a policy row or a subject but defaults to what her prior convictions tell her, regardless of whether they fit the facts or not.\n\nI think that her failure to do the reading also explains this Guardian scoop. In 2015, when Badenoch was a member of the Greater London Authority, she was one of the co-authors of a report that criticised Prevent, suggesting that the programme could alienate communities. Such terms are near-identical to the ones she now castigates Keir Starmer and Yvette Cooper for signing up to. (She said on X last week: \u201cWhen the Conservatives were trying to toughen the Prevent anti-extremism programme, [Keir] Starmer and [Yvette] Cooper were running for office on manifestos worried about Prevent \u2018alienating communities\u2019.\u201d)\n\nI don\u2019t think that her failure to write a dissenting opinion, as one other member of that GLA committee did, is because her \u201ctrue\u201d opinions are closer to Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto than she lets on. I think it\u2019s because in 2015 she didn\u2019t do the reading, just as she has yet to demonstrate a grip on a topic at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. This is obviously a problem because our system works best when the leader of the opposition is across the detail of what the government is doing.\n\nBut it is particularly important on this topic, because the specifics of this case are so unlike most of the threats the UK faces. When the government proposes some potentially far-reaching changes to our response to terrorism works, the leader of the opposition really needs to be across the facts of this specific set of crimes to do her job properly.\n\nFor reasons I don\u2019t fully understand, when I try and read a grown-up novel in January and February, my brain revolts: I read slowly, fitfully and there is no pleasure in it. I used to fight against this but the only consequence was to prolong the problem. So in the first two months of the year, I either read non-fiction or children\u2019s literature. At the moment I am rereading what I think is actually my favourite of Salman Rushdie\u2019s many excellent novels, Haroun and the Sea of Stories, one of two novels he wrote for his children.", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1e8a149b-dc0d-4ca1-a69f-07fb74ab2040"}, {"uuid4": "d6c172c1-adcc-4204-8d8b-9b5b0a78e57e", "title": "The battle against infrastructure delays is far from won", "description": "Transport and energy projects can deliver the growth Britain needs \u2014 if ministers act decisively", "author": "Shevaun Haviland", "published_date": "2025-01-27T05:01:00.811Z", "content": "The writer is director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce\n\nThis is a difficult time for British business, but the economy is not on its knees and decisive government action can still lift the gloom. The challenges we face are well understood. Rising employer costs, including the increase in national insurance contributions, are squeezing margins. Post-Brexit customs arrangements continue to create complexity for companies trading with the EU.\n\nThe British Chambers of Commerce quarterly economic survey \u2014 the largest poll of business sentiment since October\u2019s Budget \u2014 found confidence at its lowest level since autumn 2022. Companies need ministers to provide a clear pathway to sustainable economic growth and one of the keys to this is investment in infrastructure. The evidence is clear: well-planned infrastructure projects not only create jobs, they also generate lasting economic benefits that hugely benefit regions and often the whole country.\n\nConsider Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). This potentially transformative project \u2014 a modern railway between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and more \u2014 exemplifies the multiplying potential of infrastructure investment. The link will do more than simply connect these cities: it will serve as a powerful economic catalyst, injecting \u00a3118bn into the northern economy by 2050. Through increased capacity and reduced journey times, it will forge stronger business connections and expand labour markets, creating opportunities for millions.\n\nBut the benefits stretch further. NPR and other projects like it are a massive stimulus through the supply chains of any local economy. They support the obvious industries \u2014 construction, manufacturing and logistics \u2014 as well as retail, hospitality for visiting workers and tech support.\n\nThe returns on such investments are compelling. Take the Ely and Haughley junction improvements, which promise to deliver nearly \u00a35 in economic benefits for every \u00a31 invested \u2014 a return that would impress any business leader.\n\nIn aviation, Gatwick\u2019s Northern Runway Project demonstrates how private investment can drive public benefit, with \u00a32.2bn of private capital creating 14,000 new jobs and contributing \u00a31bn annually to the local economy. The recent announcement by the chancellor of support for this project \u2014 alongside expansion at Luton and a third runway at Heathrow \u2014 are big promises and show a government unafraid to take difficult decisions to deliver growth.\n\nWe applaud this and welcome planned limits on spurious\u00a0lawfare that allows vested interests to seemingly delay every proposal. Judicial review is too often a tool for the few to stand in the way of the interests of the many.\n\nBut the battle is far from won. The government must now deliver on its promises. Because it isn\u2019t just transport projects affected right now. Every day wasted is another solar farm pushed back and another high-voltage undersea cable becoming that much more expensive.\n\nEnergy infrastructure is crucial to our economic future. The Sizewell C nuclear reactor represents more than just power generation. It embodies economic regeneration and a vote of confidence in the UK, 25,000 construction jobs and opportunities across the supply chain.\n\nEconomic growth and meeting net zero targets are not a zero-sum game. Strategic investment in energy infrastructure has the unique potential to benefit the entire country, while helping to meet our climate goals. In the long term, we will benefit from cheaper, more secure supplies \u2014 but only if we build capacity now.\n\nOur international competitors are not standing still.

Failure to do so would be \u201ca disincentive to investors\u201d and harm the sector\u2019s competitiveness, it said. The thresholds are set by asset size and number of active accounts. Financiers estimate that at least five fast-growing banks, such as Revolut, are likely to soon be caught by the requirement to issue the loss-absorbing debt.\n\nUnder rules introduced after the 2008 financial crisis, banks above a certain size need an extra layer of debt that regulators can wipe out or convert to equity in a crisis, known as MREL \u2014 minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities. This is designed to avoid governments ever needing to use taxpayer funds to rescue failed lenders.\n\nThe rules came under fresh scrutiny after the BoE intervened to transfer the UK subsidiary of failed US lender Silicon Valley Bank to HSBC over a weekend in 2023.\n\nIn response, the government introduced new legislation allowing the BoE to use funds from the sector\u2019s deposit insurance scheme to finance the transfer of a failed bank to a rival.\n\nThe BoE said in October it planned to introduce a \u201ccontractual trigger\u201d into loss-absorbing debt that allowed officials to wipe it out if the foreign parent of a British bank is put into resolution, even if the UK subsidiary remains operationally viable.\n\nUK Finance said regulators in other jurisdictions \u201chave not taken such an expansive approach to the use of contractual triggers\u201d and warned the plans would create \u201csignificant challenges\u201d for lenders.\n\nThe sector fears that it would be costly to rewrite the terms of billions pounds worth of loss-absorbing debt to give the BoE this extra power, while warning it could change the accounting treatment of the securities. UK Finance said the central bank should at least exclude existing debt.\n\nIn October, the BoE said it planned to raise the size threshold above which banks need to raise such debt from total assets of \u00a315bn-\u00a325bn to \u00a320bn-\u00a330bn. It also said banks caught by a separate threshold based on the number of active accounts would no longer have to raise this loss-absorbing debt.\n\nUK Finance called for the central bank to go further by increasing the size threshold to \u00a340bn-\u00a350bn to take account of inflation since the rule was introduced in 2015. It also called for the active account threshold to be scrapped or raised from 40,000-80,000 to 100,000-150,000.\n\nRevolut, which was granted a UK banking licence last year, increased its total assets from \u00a314.1bn in 2022 to \u00a317.4bn in 2023. The bank declined to comment.\n\nUK Finance said its proposals were designed to \u201creflect technological advances and consumer preferences, alongside regulatory reforms in the past few years and to be consistent with major international jurisdictions such as the EU and US\u201d.\n\nThe BoE said the consultation ended on Friday and it was considering responses.", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9cc7788b-151d-4649-b73a-30baf63166d1"}, {"uuid4": "ad0922b3-780d-4d6c-8738-024692d80e31", "title": "How low will UK interest rates go?", "description": "There is more room for the Bank of England to loosen monetary policy than the market expects", "author": "Peder Beck-Friis", "published_date": "2025-01-27T05:01:00.751Z", "content": "The writer is senior vice-president and economist at Pimco\n\nUK government bond yields are off to a volatile start to the year. After rising sharply in the first two weeks \u2014 by roughly 0.3 percentage points for five-year gilts \u2014 they have now returned to where they started. While there is noise around fiscal policy, the moves have largely been driven by global factors. US bond yields have exhibited similar volatility.\n\nBond markets in the UK may be more sensitive to fiscal credibility following the turbulence after the 2022 Liz Truss budget. But fiscal sustainability in the UK does not significantly differ from some peers, including France, which has a higher fiscal deficit and more rapidly rising debt.\n\nThe UK remains an outlier, however, on the other side of the policy ledger. The Bank of England\u2019s policy rate of 4.75 per cent is now the highest among large developed countries. That is weighing on activity. Economic growth has stagnated since the summer, and labour demand has fallen sharply. Inflation has eased in the past year and is now in the \u201ctwo-point-something\u201d range, close to the BoE\u2019s target of 2 per cent. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that at its December meeting the BoE repeated its intention to lower its policy rate ahead.\n\nBut how low will it go? Unlike many other central banks, the BoE has not provided clear guidance. Estimating the equilibrium rate, where monetary policy is neither tight or loose, requires a great deal of humility. It depends on factors affecting the supply and demand for capital, which naturally change over time.\n\nA simple way to estimate it is by looking at economic growth. High-growth countries attract more investment and encourage less saving, pushing rates higher. By this measure, the market\u2019s expected long-term interest rate in the UK seems high. Productivity has only increased by 0.5 per cent (annualised) since the pandemic began, slightly below its pre-pandemic rate and less than a third of that in the US \u2014 and actual productivity may be even lower owing to ongoing issues with the labour force survey data, which probably under-reports employment levels.\n\nInflation puts upward pressure on interest rates, too. Although core inflation in the UK \u2014 at 3.2 per cent over the past year \u2014 remains slightly higher than in most other developed countries, it\u2019s trending down. Underlying price pressures, excluding one-time tax shocks, are easing, especially in services. Based on medium-term inflation expectations, the central bank\u2019s credibility is intact and we see few reasons why the UK will have structurally higher inflation than in other countries.\n\nYet markets remain sceptical, expecting only a few cuts ahead to a final destination of around 4 per cent. This outlook may reflect concerns that increased government spending could lead to higher inflation. Markets might also question the government\u2019s commitment to its new fiscal rules, given its recent history of adjustments. Like Italy, but unlike most other large, developed countries, the UK borrows money at a much higher interest rate than its underlying economic growth rate, worsening debt dynamics.\n\nWe have a more benign central view for inflation, even if we acknowledge that fiscal policy adds uncertainty. Despite increased government spending, taxes will rise too, leaving fiscal policy tight. The net effect will probably drag on activity and employment, as already evident in recent surveys. Firms may pass some of the National Insurance hike on to consumers, but that would be a price level adjustment \u2014 like a value added tax or tariff hike. Typically, that is something central banks look through. And we would be very surprised if the government did not adjust taxation or spending to meet its fiscal rules, given the bond market\u2019s recent volatility.\n\nAs such, we expect UK gilt yields to decline. The five-year gilt yield is now only a fraction lower than that in the US and we expect it to fall below the US level over time, similar to the five years before the pandemic. While the risks of rates going higher remain \u2014 near-term inflation expectations have edged higher in recent months \u2014 there are more reasons to expect rates to fall, given increased global trade uncertainty, tight fiscal policy and a generally soft growth outlook.\n\nAs for the policy rate, our internal models point to a neutral interest rate of 2 to 3 per cent in the UK. Even if the BoE is cautious with rate cuts in the first half of this year, we see room for the rate to fall by more than the market expects. The BoE might eventually follow other central banks, including the European Central Bank, Bank of Canada, Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Riksbank in pivoting to faster cuts.", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/11492c24-7af8-4e70-b0ee-fd3af93ac68e"}, {"uuid4": "808ace05-218e-455a-af1a-596bbe41df8f", "title": "Does lower inflation make bonds an appealing option for portfolios?", "description": "Gilts can offer an attractive income that is regular, predictable and contractual", "author": "Moira O'Neill", "published_date": "2025-01-27T05:01:00.682Z", "content": "The early weeks of 2025 have been awash with news headlines about a bond market sell-off. However, investment platform AJ Bell points out that there are always two sides to every market story \u2014 and the rise in yields as bond prices fall means retail investors\u2019 appetite for UK government bonds is picking up.\n\nIn January, the UK Treasury sold \u00a34.25bn-worth of five-year gilts at an average yield of 4.49 per cent, with \u00a312.74bn-worth of bids received. AJ Bell customers were among those fuelling this strong demand in the auction.\n\nAnd they were not alone. At the end of last year, many analysts were pointing out that the time had come to invest in bonds. The recovery from 2022, the worst year for bonds, has been robust. \u201cSome high yield managers have been doing as well as global equities over the past two years,\u201d points out Tideway Wealth\u2019s investment director Nick Gait.\n\nBonds can offer an attractive income that is regular, predictable and contractual. But they are also good portfolio diversifiers, able to offset poor performance when equity markets decline in value \u2014 and some wealth managers already believe the bull market in equities is looking a bit long in the tooth.\n\nTideway Wealth even has some clients whose self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) are 100 per cent invested in fixed income. The rationale is that, while the US-led bull market in equities may continue, the downside risks are increasing. Bonds with real yields may be a good alternative for older investors \u2014 or those in pension drawdown.\n\n\u201cThe higher government bond yields go, the greater the competition against equities for investors\u2019 money,\u201d says Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. \u201cAt some point, investors will take the view that they can get a decent yield from bonds for lower risk compared with investing in stocks.\u201d\n\nAnother factor that has made fixed income look more attractive is a slowdown in inflation after years of rapidly rising consumer prices.\n\n\u201cInflation moving from a high rate to a low or normal rate is not something we have experienced in a generation, so investors have forgotten just how attractive this environment can be for fixed income,\u201d notes April LaRusse, head of investment specialists at Insight Investment.\n\nMateusz Malek, head of bond research at Killik & Co adds: \u201cAlthough we have recently entered the period when inflation is expected to reaccelerate slightly, overall, it is forecast to remain contained and below the level of yields offered by bonds.\u201d Interest rate cuts could also boost bond returns.\n\nHowever, Thomas Becket, co-chief investment officer of Canaccord Genuity Wealth, thinks gilts have been selling off partly because of a repricing of UK interest rate expectations.\n\nThis wobble in the market also serves as a reminder that bonds are not risk free. \u201cInvestors are worried about extra borrowing by the UK government to achieve its plans, and the uncertain outlook for the economy given widespread pessimism by businesses and consumers,\u201d says Coatsworth.\n\nHowever, some view the recent yield movements as largely an overreaction to global political uncertainty.\n\n\u201cWe believe gilt yields will fall over 2025/26, as the Bank of England unwinds their current restrictive stance, and will eventually reach a level consistent with the fundamentals of the UK economy,\u201d says Matt Tickle chief investment officer at Barnett Waddingham.\n\nIn the UK, private investors can access gilts and T-bills, but investing in corporate bonds is heavily regulated and limited only to professionals. Some wealth managers, such as Killik, will build portfolios of corporate bonds for their clients. Others, like Tideway, use professionally managed bond funds, such as Royal London UK Government Bond, or, for investment-grade credit, the Man Group Sterling Corporate Bond. \u201cWe have spoken to our bond fund managers in the wake of recent movements and they are optimistic of high single-digit returns again in 2025,\u201d says Tideway\u2019s Gait.\n\nEven so, investors should always be aware of the two core risks: duration (the measure of interest rate risk the portfolio aims to take) and credit quality (how much risk you\u2019re willing to take to achieve returns).\n\n\u201cHaving any certainty over the longer end of the yield curve is perilously hard,\u201d Becket says. \u201cThere is no clarity on the outlook for any of interest rates, inflation and government policy improving.\u201d\n\nGait adds: \u201cThe greater than 5 per cent return now available on long duration gilts is clearly attracting retail investors, particularly on low coupon bonds where gains will be tax free. But many, I suspect, will underestimate the risks when you buy longer duration.\u201d\n\nThe most popular gilts with retail investors using the Interactive Investor platform at the end of 2024 included T26 and TN28, maturing at the end of January 2026 and January 2028. Because these gilts have coupons of 0.125 per cent and trade below their par value, most of the return comes from the \u00a3100 redemption value of each gilt on maturity, which is capital gains tax free \u2014 making them popular with investors holding them outside of tax-advantaged individual savings accounts, or SIPPs.\n\n\u201cGilt prices move when market conditions change, but gilts maturing soon are less volatile than longer-dated gilts,\u201d says Sam Benstead, fixed income lead at Interactive Investor. \u201cIf you want a near-guaranteed return, then direct gilts are a good option, particularly bonds maturing soon.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/515ed6b0-e45d-4c64-b109-f6869525e719"}, {"uuid4": "8482fc56-7cf5-4758-81be-d5a9741ec6df", "title": "Move fast on planning to restore \u2018animal spirits\u2019, US investor tells Keir Starmer", "description": "UK\u2019s record of slow growth can be turned around, says Birmingham City FC owner ", "author": "Josh Noble", "published_date": "2025-01-27T05:01:00.638Z", "content": "The US owner of Birmingham City football club has said the UK can unlock a wave of inbound investment \u201cincredibly quickly\u201d if the government makes tangible progress on its pledge to speed up planning approvals.\n\nTom Wagner, co-founder of Knighthead Capital, told the Financial Times that Britain\u2019s record of under-investment and slow growth could be turned around if Labour made good on its vow to remove obstacles to development.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of projects that we are looking at in the UK that we\u2019d love to pursue if the process can be made easier,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not the only ones. If things change by just a small amount, there\u2019ll be a lot of capital inflow and a lot of excess growth.\u201d\n\nKnighthead has acquired more than 60 acres of land around Birmingham City\u2019s stadium since taking control of the third-tier team in 2023. The New York-based hedge fund plans to build a new 60,000-seat venue as part of a large \u00a33bn regeneration project involving housing, retail and entertainment space in one of the UK\u2019s poorest neighbourhoods.\n\nThe firm manages about $9bn and has yet to submit formal planning applications for the project, which hinges on local authorities agreeing to set up new transport links. A proposed extension of Birmingham\u2019s tram network through the area has been repeatedly delayed over several years.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has sought in recent weeks to prop up business confidence in the sluggish UK economy, as increased public borrowing and sterling weakness prompted warnings from billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio that the country was heading towards a \u201cdebt death spiral\u201d.\n\nWhile Starmer wooed business before taking power in July, promising to \u201cbulldoze through barriers to British success\u201d, including with an overhaul of planning rules, relations were damaged by a \u00a340bn tax-raising Budget that weighed heavily on companies.\n\nWagner said he was still \u201cvery bullish\u201d about the UK\u2019s long-term prospects, saying the country had a \u201chighly educated, diverse, dynamic economy\u201d and the \u201csingle most exciting city in the world\u201d with the capital London. He conceded that Knighthead\u2019s bet on the UK appeared \u201ccontrarian\u201d, but that broader \u201canimal spirits\u201d could return swiftly.\n\n\u201cThat can change incredibly quickly if the government begins making progress on its initiatives, which I believe they will do. You\u2019ll see that turn. Once you start seeing some positive momentum, that leads to more positive momentum.\u201d\n\nWith Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House expected to usher in a period of heightened economic competition and increase the gravitational pull of the US, Wagner said the onus was on governments around the world to make decisions that lowered barriers to investment.\n\n\u201cCapital is highly mobile, it will find the path of least resistance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen governments begin making things harder, vis-\u00e0-vis other jurisdictions into which that capital may flow, they will suffer.\u201d\n\nIn the UK, Wagner said planning remained the biggest obstacle to investment. \u201cThe solutions aren\u2019t that hard to get right. And when I see relatively easy solutions that are in the way of progress and capital investment, I tend to think that the right path will be found,\u201d he said.\n\nLabour has led an overhaul of England\u2019s national planning policy and proposed to limit the influence of local committees, as well as curtail attempts to block development through the courts. But experts have warned the changes could take years to take full effect.\n\nWagner, a former Goldman Sachs distressed debt trader, said Birmingham city council\u2019s financial woes \u2014 it was declared bankrupt last year and forced to make drastic cuts to spending \u2014 had \u201cvery little\u201d impact on Knighthead\u2019s plans so far, and the firm was continuing to buy up land in an area just over a mile away from the city centre.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hearing all the right things in our conversations. What we need to see now is a bit more action,\u201d he said, adding that he wanted to see real progress this calendar year on the potential extension of the city\u2019s Metro tramline to the site of the proposed new stadium. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that they\u2019ll do what needs to be done. If they can\u2019t for this project, well then maybe I\u2019d be more pessimistic on the UK economy more broadly.\u201d\n\nKnighthead\u2019s plans also rely on something even harder to predict: sporting success. Birmingham City were relegated to League One in their first season under US ownership, but are now top of the table of English football\u2019s third tier.\n\nThe team are still getting average attendances at home games of more than 26,000, higher than several Premier League sides, while former NFL star Tom Brady is now an adviser and shareholder at the club.\n\nWagner said the goal was to take Birmingham City back to the Premier League and stay there for a \u201clong period of time\u201d, and in the process rekindle the fierce local rivalry with Aston Villa. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly ambitious and probably a bit cocky thing to say, but, why bother if that\u2019s not the objective?\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/26edcee4-55e5-46b9-ac22-49d47b653399"}, {"uuid4": "89cc33b7-7f55-4ac2-ad22-aa491c635158", "title": "Serco workers plan to strike over UK navy contract negotiations", "description": "Prospect union says proposed changes to existing \u00a31.2bn deal threaten Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent", "author": "Oliver Telling", "published_date": "2025-01-27T04:00:59.997Z", "content": "Workers at military contractor Serco are set to strike over a deal being negotiated by the company and the UK\u2019s Royal Navy, which they say could cut \u201cessential\u201d support for Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent.\n\nTrade union Prospect said up to a quarter of Serco\u2019s UK marine workforce will walk out for a day next month.\n\nThe union wants the company to pause discussions on a 10-year contract to replace Serco\u2019s existing \u00a31.2bn deal with the navy that is expiring this year.\n\nUnion representatives told the Financial Times they were concerned that the new contract could lead to cuts at Serco\u2019s marine business, which employs about 600 people.Under the current contract, Serco operates 91 vessels that provide services such as transporting personnel and moving larger ships to and from land, including the UK\u2019s nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers.\n\nProspect said it was told in a meeting with officials last year that savings of \u00a3250mn were being targeted over the duration of the new contract and up to 96 fewer Serco employees would be required.\n\n\u201cThe services covered by this contract are essential for national security and for the continuous at-sea deterrent,\u201d said Sue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary at Prospect. \u201cPausing now and reconsidering will avoid a costly and dangerous mistake.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s \u201ccontinuous at-sea deterrent\u201d involves a rotating fleet of nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarines, with at least one submarine at sea at any given time.\n\nThe government has said this provides \u201ca credible and effective response option to extreme aggression\u201d.\n\nBut Prospect, which has more than 150 members in Serco\u2019s marine business, said it was concerned the company would struggle to provide a continuous service towing submarines and other navy vessels if the cuts went ahead.The union also warned that it would be difficult to get more staff at a later stage if the navy realised it did not have enough people because it can take years to train replacements.\n\nIt said 87 per cent of members who participated in a ballot voted to strike.\u201cIf it continues as planned [this] will mean the loss of vital jobs which it will not be then possible to replace when the navy inevitably realises that it has made a mistake,\u201d Ferns said.The navy services provided by Serco were privatised through a 15-year contract worth \u00a31bn from 2007, with the company getting a 27-month extension worth \u00a3200mn in December 2022.\n\nNegotiations for the new contract are being finalised as the new Labour government is enforcing spending controls to ease pressure on its finances.

But that is the attitude that has stunted economic growth and left working people worse off,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe low growth is our destiny.\u201d\n\nReeves announced new plans to speed up the construction of new homes near commuter train stations, as part of reforms under a new planning and infrastructure bill.\n\nThe Treasury said the new rules would ensure that when developers submit an application for acceptable types of schemes in key areas \u2014 such as near commuter transport hubs \u2014 the default answer would be \u201cyes\u201d.\n\nReeves also backed a regeneration project around Old Trafford in Manchester, which has been championed by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham.\n\nThe Treasury said it would see \u201cnew housing, commercial and public space as a shining example of the bold pro-development model that will drive growth across the region\u201d.\n\nManchester United have plans to rebuild or redevelop Old Trafford, which city leaders claim could drive one of the UK\u2019s \u201cbiggest ever urban regeneration projects\u201d.\n\nThe Premier League club will decide by the end of this season whether to build a new 100,000-capacity ground, creating the country\u2019s biggest stadium, or upgrade and expand the existing one.\n\nBurnham dubbed the proposal \u201cthe largest opportunity for urban regeneration\u201d since the 2012 London Olympic Games.", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/45da1378-8997-44cb-9b0e-619eb118daf6"}, {"uuid4": "2565ebcd-8eb6-41c0-a771-d53cdde0961a", "title": "UK revives plan for Oxford-Cambridge Arc", "description": "Government aims to double economic output of science-rich region between Britain\u2019s two best-known universities ", "author": "Peter Foster", "published_date": "2025-01-27T00:01:59.675Z", "content": "The UK government has revived a strategic plan to build transport links and housing between Oxford and Cambridge, the latest sign that Labour is focusing on high-productivity areas of the economy in its push for growth.\n\nThe decision to back the Oxford-Cambridge Arc marks a return to political favour for a scheme that was shelved three years ago after then Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson prioritised \u201clevelling up\u201d poorer regions.\n\nScience secretary Peter Kyle on Monday said the government wanted to double the economic output of the science-rich region that stretches between Britain\u2019s two best-known universities, with the manufacturing and logistics hub of Milton Keynes in between.\n\n\u201cThe Oxford-Cambridge Arc is already an engine of prosperity, but we can go even further. We are determined to unleash research and development as a driving force in our mission to grow the economy in every corner of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nNo new money was announced for the Arc on Monday. But the government committed in the October Budget to deliver the East West Rail project that will revive the \u201cVarsity\u201d railway, which connected Oxford and Cambridge until it was closed in 1967.\n\nFast-tracking the scheme, which is inspired by the science clusters of Boston and San Francisco in the US, would add \u00a378bn of GDP to the UK economy by 2035, according to research by consultancy Public First for the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster Board, which comprises industry and university leaders.\n\nThe announcement, which comes ahead of UK chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 \u201cgrowth\u201d speech this week, was welcomed by the vice-chancellors of Oxford and Cambridge universities as well as senior executives at pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca UK and computer chip designer Arm.\n\nSupercluster board chair Andy Williams said its members, \u201cwhich include some of the world\u2019s largest investors, see extraordinary potential and in this commitment it is abundantly clear that the government does too\u201d.\n\nThe original plan was devised in 2017 by the National Infrastructure Commission and was a top priority of successive Conservative governments, most recently coming back into favour under former prime minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nIt promised to deliver an extra 1mn homes and 700,000 jobs but met with a fierce political backlash from local groups opposed to new developments.\n\nHowever, Sir Keir Starmer, prime minister, has signalled he is prepared to confront such objections, promising to construct 1.5mn homes in this parliament and to \u201cput builders not blockers first\u201d to boost the stagnating economy.\n\nMike Davey, Labour leader of Cambridge City Council, welcomed the backing of the Arc but cautioned it would require investment in more affordable homes, as well as improved water and transport infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe government should learn from the mistakes the Tories made on the Arc \u2014 we need to bring local communities with us and they need to see the benefits,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile praising ministers\u2019 ambition for the Arc, senior executives said the plan would require improvements to infrastructure alongside reforms to deliver faster planning permissions, easier access to global workers and capital.\n\nOxford and Cambridge have suffered from shortages of water and electricity that have led to environmental regulators temporarily blocking housing and science developments.\n\nRichard O\u2019Boyle, chief executive of Pioneer Group, which runs life sciences campuses, said OxCam

sign of the difficulties of development in the area, a decision on whether to relocate a sewage works in north Cambridge was delayed for a second time in January, in effect freezing a 5,600-home development.\n\nNick Pettit, senior partner at real estate adviser Bidwells, said it was an indication of the strength of interest in OxCam that global investors were attracted to the region despite the difficulties with planning and procurement.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that small policy changes are all it takes for this region to make an enormous difference to its contribution to national growth,\u201d he added.\n\nThe government has said it is committed to investing in regional growth as part of its Industrial Strategy, although offering such high-profile backing to Oxford and Cambridge risks fuelling accusations that the south of England is being favoured in the push for growth.\n\nHowever, Dan Thorp, chief executive of advocacy group Cambridge Ahead, said backing OxCam was \u201cnot a zero-sum game\u201d and Cambridge was working with other groups, such as the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, to create \u201cconnected clusters\u201d that shared in growth.\n\n\u201cThe big bang benefit for the government\u2019s growth mission can come from linking what happens in OxCam to the rest of the UK,\u201d he added.", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url":

Helena Hudson, whose Real Eating Company has 10 outlets in market towns and cathedral cities across south-east England.\n\nEven in prosperous areas, \u201cpeople are still very much watching the pennies\u201d, she said, leaving her little hope of offsetting a \u00a3127,000 rise in her tax bill in April through price rises alone. Nor can Hudson hold down wages, since a minimum-wage increase of 6.7 per cent will apply to many of her staff.\n\nSo she is cutting jobs: closing a caf\u00e9 in London, making a long-standing manager redundant and asking part-timers to work longer hours or leave, since they will no longer fall below the threshold for employer national insurance contributions. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we want to do,\u201d Hudson said.\n\nBusinesses across the UK are making similarly uncomfortable choices as they calculate how best to respond to the tax and wage increases announced by Rachel Reeves in the October Budget.\n\nThe policies \u2014 which the chancellor said would help restore \u201cstability to the public finances\u201d and pay for public services \u2014 will sharply increase labour costs, particularly in low-wage sectors such as retail and hospitality.\n\nThe question the Bank of England must answer is whether a weaker jobs market will finally bring down wage growth \u2014 or whether stubborn pay pressures will persist, keeping inflation above the official 2 per cent target.\n\nThere is mounting evidence that employers have cut headcount in the wake of the Budget announcements, with official data showing payroll employment fell in November and December as vacancies kept sliding.\n\nSurvey data published on Friday suggested the share of businesses cutting staffing levels was higher in January than at any point since the 2008-09 financial crisis, except the pandemic period.\n\nLiz Martins, economist at HSBC, said the combination of a weaker economy, higher costs and new scope for artificial intelligence-related efficiencies felt \u201clike a perfect storm\u201d for the jobs market.\n\nLast week, retailer J Sainsbury said it was axing 3,000 jobs, from its head office to its in-store caf\u00e9s, while an executive at Associated British Foods, owner of the low-cost fashion chain Primark, said people were starting to buy fewer clothes because of worries about job security.\n\nBut despite such retrenchment, wage growth has accelerated. Data last week showed private sector earnings grew at an annual pace of 6 per cent in the three months to November, excluding bonuses \u2014 double the 3 per cent pace the BoE thinks broadly consistent with the inflation target.\n\nOne contributing factor, highlighted in a recent trading statement by retailer Next, is that increases in the minimum wage have a lasting \u201cripple\u201d effect on pay higher up the scale, as employers seek to maintain incentives for promotion to higher grades.\n\nAndrew Wishart, economist at Berenberg bank, described this situation as a \u201cmassive headache\u201d for the BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, which is expected to cut interest rates from 4.75 per cent to 4.5 per cent when it next meets on February 6.\n\nHe said the minimum wage was \u201cbecoming a serious problem\u201d because it prevented low-wage employers absorbing the \u00a325bn NICs increase by holding down pay.\n\nYet even as they shed jobs, other businesses would still be able to pass on higher costs to consumers, keeping services price inflation above 4 per cent and pushing headline inflation above 3 per cent later this year.\n\nThe BoE, which watches services inflation closely, was still likely to lower interest rates in the short term in order to prevent a \u201chorrible\u201d outcome for workers, but it might need to stop cutting the cost of borrowing in the second half of the year, Wishart said.\n\nOther economists believe wage growth will slow over the course of the year, as companies will no longer fight to recruit higher-paid professionals who cannot wring a salary rise out of their current employer.\n\nMartins of HSBC said that trend was \u201cin the past now\u201d. While April\u2019s changes might lead some companies to raise prices initially, she argued that all the other ways they might respond \u2014 replacing workers with AI, squeezing pay, cutting jobs or offshoring work \u2014 would eventually lower inflation.\n\nBut wage growth may not subside fast enough for the BoE\u2019s comfort.\n\nFour-fifths of employers planned to make lower pay awards this year than in 2024, according to a poll conducted by analysts at Incomes Data Research and published on Monday. Most said the increase in NICs would make them less generous than they otherwise would have been.\n\nBut the survey found that more than half of employers who had not yet decided their award expected it to exceed 3 per cent. Where pay deals had been agreed, more than 40 per cent of employees were receiving 4 per cent or more.\n\n\u201cAll business surveys illustrate the same conundrum for the MPC. Payroll tax hikes, global uncertainty and tariff threats are driving inflation and output in opposite directions,\u201d said Elliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nThis meant that even with growth weak enough to warrant rate cuts, inflation remained strong enough to require caution, he added, noting that tax increases were affecting both jobs and prices more than rate-setters had expected, with little effect on wages.\n\nIf this remains the case, unemployment may need to rise further than previously thought for the BoE to keep inflation down.\n\n\u201cWage growth will take a little longer to come down than the BoE might like, but we think that remaining pressures are being driven by government policy, not a tighter labour market,\u201d Martins said.", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b18013b1-b5d3-4f20-8148-24d1fb68577e"}, {"uuid4": "bbad026d-0629-4605-9308-edacfae076b9", "title": "One in five UK-listed companies warned on profits in 2024 as costs rise", "description": "Proportion is third highest this century and exceeded only by figures in 2001 and 2020", "author": "Ellesheva Kissin", "published_date": "2025-01-27T00:01:59.656Z", "content": "One in five UK-listed companies sounded the alarm on profits in 2024, underlining the impact of rising costs and businesses\u2019 reluctance to commit to optional spending.\n\nA total of 19 per cent of London-listed companies issued profit warnings, the third highest proportion this century and exceeded only by the figures in 2001 and 2020 when the dotcom bust and pandemic hurt performance, according to a report published by EY-Parthenon on Monday.\n\nThe figures come after S&P Global survey data last week showed that UK businesses were cutting jobs at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe bulk of the 2024 profit warnings stemmed from companies\u2019 reluctance to spend money buying goods and services from other businesses, according to EY-Parthenon.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect a huge uptick in insolvency levels in 2025, but we are now seeing more distress, and more stakeholders viewing insolvency processes as a real option,\u201d said Jo Robinson, head of turnaround and restructuring strategy for EY-Parthenon in the UK and Ireland.\n\nThe report found that 34 per cent of the warnings cited contract and order cancellations or delays as reasons for reduced profitability, up from about a quarter in 2023.\n\nThe companies worst hit included business service providers, industrial suppliers and recruitment companies \u2014 sectors vulnerable to corporate customers reducing their spending.

Pension experts estimate allowing companies to access scheme surpluses could unlock up to \u00a3100bn for investment.\n\nThe government had previously focused its pensions review on consolidating defined contribution (DC) and local authority pension assets. A review into pensions adequacy, which the government had hoped would drive more investment into the UK, has been delayed indefinitely.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times in November, former pensions minister Emma Reynolds said she had prioritised reforming DC workplace schemes because that was \u201cwhere the growth is\u201d.\n\nShe pointed out the majority of corporate DB pension schemes were closed to new members and \u201cnaturally had a less long time frame\u201d as schemes move into less risky assets as they wind down or sell their pension obligations to an insurance company.\n\nHowever, industry insiders said a radical improvement in the funding position of DB pension schemes in recent years following a rise in government bond yields meant many were now in a position to take on more risk, if the rules enabled companies and scheme members to benefit from it.\n\n\u201cThe reason the government announcements have been about DC and the Local Government Pension Scheme is because they\u2019ve not really understood DB and think it\u2019s too big to touch\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but the implications of not touching it are worse for the government and I think they realise it now,\u201d said the chair of a multibillion pound DB pension scheme.\n\nDavid Lane, chief executive officer at TPT Retirement Solutions, which manages DB and DC pensions, said allowing companies to access scheme surpluses was \u201clikely to be a more effective way of channelling pension assets in to the UK economy than some of the consolidation initiatives that have been announced\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it\u2019s direct if the employer reinvests that money into its business\u201d.\n\nAccess to scheme surpluses could slow the pace at which pension funds have been offloading their pension obligations to insurance companies, with around \u00a350bn of assets transferred in so-called bulk annuity transactions in each of the past two years, according to pensions consultancy WTW.\n\nHalting this trend could help support UK government bond and equity markets in the longer term because insurance companies typically sell gilts and invest in higher-yielding corporate bonds \u2014 many of which are overseas \u2014 as well as infrastructure to make their profits.\n\nZoe Alexander, director of the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association trade group, said she backed surplus release, with the right protections in place to ensure member benefits are secure.\n\n\u201cLowering the legislative threshold for allowing returns of surplus could potentially encourage trustees (in conjunction with their employers) to adopt a more ambitious mindset and take on slightly riskier investment strategies for their DB assets, including greater investment in UK assets,\u201d she said.", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/83edcc72-2d6f-4cef-8364-86c5d0c1f15a"}, {"uuid4": "c81d7bd3-37a4-4042-9a44-cd6e1e051545", "title": "How Britain can seize the next decade", "description": "Marginal gains in the country\u2019s strengths and weaknesses would go a long way", "author": "Tej Parikh", "published_date": "2025-01-26T12:00:51.675Z", "content": "Welcome readers. I\u2019m backpacking in Vietnam and Laos this week, so I\u2019ve prepared something slightly different.\n\nAs readers know, the aim of Free Lunch on Sunday is to present analysis that counters conventional wisdom. For each piece, this often involves discussing positions with economists and market strategists that are not necessarily their house view.\n\nSo for this edition, rather than the usual synthesis of my findings, I wanted to share more of what the analysts told me. I asked experts to sketch out a bullish scenario for the British economy over the next decade, and what it would take to get there. Here\u2019s what they said.\n\nFirst, the global backdrop. Labour\u2019s large parliamentary majority means the UK now stands out for its (relative) stability. France has an unstable coalition and Germany faces an election in February. Political views in the EU are splintering. In the US, President Donald Trump appears more interested in fomenting uncertainty.\n\nAs for trade disruption, Britain\u2019s specialism in services \u2014 and position outside the EU \u2014 puts it less in the line of fire of Trump\u2019s tariff plans. The US president is more focused on the trade in goods, particularly with China and the European trading bloc.\n\nLabour has already eaten into this \u201cstability dividend\u201d by lumbering companies with high taxes in its autumn Budget. Still, Marko Papic, chief strategist at BCA Research, reckons that the autonomy Britain has from being less restrained by internal politics and trade wars could be a boon:\n\nBuilding on this advantage would require a targeted approach to striking agreements. Deals on the trade in services could allow Britain to export its comparative advantage in high-value services further and wider. And reducing the red tape involved in trading with the EU, the UK\u2019s largest trading partner, would boost supply chains.\n\nLess Trump exposure is also why some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest institutions are betting that UK equities will outpace the rest of Europe\u2019s this year. They believe banks and energy companies \u2014 which have large weightings on the London Stock Exchange \u2014 could experience a boost from Trump\u2019s deregulation and pro-oil policies. Low valuations also look attractive.\n\nBut British stocks will still need a catalyst to drive equity values up. I asked Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, where it may come from:\n\nIndeed, Britain ranks third in Capital Economics\u2019 index of advanced economies best-placed to benefit from AI adoption, given its large services sector and flexible labour market.\n\nEfforts to unshackle Britain\u2019s vast pension capital \u2014 the largest in Europe \u2014 could support more investment in public and private equities, both at home and abroad. But Gimber suggests there are better levers to pull:\n\nA few studies suggest slashing stamp duty on shares could raise revenues in the long term by boosting growth.\n\nAnd with tight public finances, \u201cremoving hurdles\u201d is where Sam Dumitriu, head of policy at Britain Remade, thinks the UK can get the biggest bang for its buck.\n\nLabour\u2019s Planning and Infrastructure Bill is expected in the coming months. If it can streamline regulations, speed up approvals and clear more land for development, investment could jump.\n\nThe government\u2019s industrial strategy, due to be published this spring, is set to unveil opportunities to crowd-in private investment into key infrastructure projects. It is also supposed to outline plans to boost Britain\u2019s existing strengths in high-demand growth sectors. These include financial and professional services, university research and education, renewables (wind, carbon capture and storage), life sciences, aerospace technology, artificial intelligence and creative industries. (Less red tape, wider investment incentives and improved access to training and high-skilled talent would all help.)\n\nThat Britain does these complex things pretty well, but struggles with simpler tasks, is a reason to be optimistic, adds Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt.\n\nIndeed, until the past couple of years, Britain struggled with political stability. Now that it has some, investment has returned. Add a few bespoke trade deals, a plan to strengthen its comparative advantages and planning reforms \u2014 and things can only get better.\n\nDumitriu added: \u201cIf we stay good at what we\u2019re good at and get less bad at what we\u2019re very bad at, then the next decade could be a very good one for Britain.\u201d\n\nThoughts?

But some analysts and advisers have warned that she could cast the inheritance tax net even wider in a bid to shore up the government\u2019s fiscal plans.\n\nThe fears have prompted more people to gift money under the current regime, which does not apply IHT at 40 per cent to gifts unless the benefactor dies within seven years.\n\n\u201cThe seven year rule is now up for grabs, that seems to be the next target,\u201d said Nimesh Shah, chief executive of accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg. \u201cYou could widen it to 10 years.

But Shah said the changes would \u201chave no impact on the direction of IHT\u201d.\n\nWealth managers said that many more of their clients faced the prospect of their estates falling within the scope of IHT over the next decade, with some attributing the increase in gifting to the changes to HMRC\u2019s treatment of pensions and agricultural land.\n\nUnused pension pots will be included in estates from April 2027 and subject to the standard 40 per cent IHT rate. Meanwhile, landowners will from April 2026 be subject to a 20 per cent levy on agricultural land above a threshold of between \u00a31.3mn and \u00a33mn, depending on whether they are married and if they own a home.\n\nEmma Sterland, chief financial planning director at Evelyn Partners, said the reforms to pensions and land taxation were behind a rise in \u201cclients thinking about making financial gifts to their families\u201d, with the Budget evidence that IHT was \u201cin the Treasury\u2019s crosshairs\u201d.\n\nIan Cook, a chartered financial planner at Quilter Cheviot, said he was encouraging clients to \u201cconsider gifting more strategically\u201d in view of the upcoming pensions taxation reforms after more had begun \u201cexploring ways to pass on wealth during their lifetime\u201d.\n\nThe Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c68787da-5b0e-4544-9654-b4dd7924c450"}, {"uuid4": "e3130382-ac66-4fde-b373-e91b4279afc9", "title": "Harland & Wolff takeover raises fears over payments to suppliers", "description": "Bankrupt shipbuilder is being bought by Spanish state-owned group Navantia", "author": "Jude Webber", "published_date": "2025-01-26T05:00:51.371Z", "content": "Harland & Wolf suppliers owed millions of pounds fear they will not be paid as the bankrupt shipbuilder is taken over by Spain\u2019s Navantia, warning of a hit to UK supply chains if they are replaced by European contractors.\n\nThe 164-year-old company best known for building the Titanic fell into administration last September, hobbled by large losses and steep interest payments on its debt.\n\nA deal was struck in December with state-owned Navantia which the UK government vowed would protect 1,000 jobs at H & W\u2019s four yards in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland.\n\nBut suppliers say jobs are already being lost in the supply chain and they have little prospect of getting their invoices paid.\n\nRussell Downs, the bankruptcy and restructuring expert brought in as interim executive chair in July, told the Financial Times in December the sale to Navantia \u201cregrettably\u201d would mean losses for creditors and suppliers.\n\nOn January 14, the four yards that had been continuing to operate followed the parent company into administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very stressful,\u201d said the chief executive of one British-based supplier who, like others, asked not to be named. \u201cThey owe us \u00a310mn plus, a reasonably big chunk of our business\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009We\u2019re an SME.

But the cash-strapped, tax-raising government is still scratching around for ideas that can make a difference. Its abrupt replacement of the chair of the antitrust regulator last week gives the impression that a looser approach to competition enforcement is in its sights. It is not a good look.\n\nForcing out Marcus Bokkerink, the chair of the UK Competition and Markets Authority, might be intended to send a message about Britain\u2019s openness to investment. Complaints that it was closed for business were hurled around in 2023 when, unlike peers, the watchdog initially blocked Microsoft\u2019s takeover of the gaming developer Activision Blizzard.\n\nAfter a modified version of the deal was approved, Microsoft described the CMA as \u201ctough and fair\u201d. Even so, the government is doubtless anxious to hear fewer complaints from potential investors about the regulator. The return to power of a US president intent on defending American interests abroad is another salient factor. The EU is wondering whether to adjust or scale back its own tech probes.\n\nSir Keir Starmer\u2019s government may want to go no further than a symbolic change of leadership and rhetorical flourishes about \u201csupercharging\u201d the economy with pro-business decisions. If it does want to consider changes to competition policy it would not be alone. A new team of US trustbusters is expected to relax the tough approach to dealmaking imposed under Joe Biden, though a return to traditionally conservative antitrust policies is not guaranteed.\n\nIn Europe, former European Central Bank governor Mario Draghi argued that domestic champions should be allowed to bulk up to compete with Chinese and US giants in last year\u2019s blockbuster report on EU competitiveness. He favoured consolidation in the telecoms sector to give companies the muscle to invest, although sceptics say there is little evidence that telecoms mergers boost investment.\n\nThe CMA is well aware of the trade-offs. It noted that intense competition can be detrimental to innovation, in research published earlier this month. Last year it gave the green light to the Vodafone-Three UK joint venture, on condition it committed to certain infrastructure investments. It has also signalled a willingness to approve mergers on the basis of behavioural, rather than structural, remedies.\n\nOverall, it is hard to argue the CMA takes an overly aggressive approach. The number of mergers it investigates that are rejected or abandoned is small and falling. The UK has seen a modest weakening of competition, measured by cost mark-ups, over the past 25 years.\n\nMinisters should avoid giving the impression they want to influence competition decisions. Keeping powerful incumbents in check can help other businesses flourish. Antitrust enforcement is generally a spur, not an impediment, to growth and productivity gains. Moreover, competition policy should be stable and predictable. Political interference fuels uncertainty, and there is little that businesses hate more.\n\nvanessa.houlder@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nWorld of profitable exits and killer acquisitions / From Simon Holmes, Visiting Professor in Law, University of Oxford, Oxfordshire, UK", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d6cd798d-b9d6-474a-9153-0d13ecffe591"}, {"uuid4": "9ecd8a65-e804-406b-bd68-ca3dfeeb2b2f", "title": "John McAslan\u2019s house of two halves", "description": "Victorian meets modern at the architect\u2019s home in south-west London.

This unusual design is the initial welcome into the expansive, expressive interior that lies beyond the front door.\n\nThe hallway, with original geometric period tiling, features an oblique, narrow glass window that frames an olive tree planted in an external side return. On\u00a0the left, it bursts open into a living area, and straight\u00a0ahead segues into a big kitchen that swings out perpendicularly into a\u00a0dining area with a vast Vitra table.\u00a0A wall of sliding glass garden doors filters light across the\u00a0entire ground floor.\n\nScotsman McAslan, who founded John McAslan+ Partners in 1993, is a pioneer of intervention and preservation \u2013 an architectural approach that favours repurposing (rather than demolishing) old buildings. His multi-award-winning practice is behind some of the most impressive transport hubs in the world including King\u2019s Cross Station, Sydney Metro\u2019s Central Station, the upgrade of Penn Station in New York and Bond Street station on the \u00a0Elizabeth Line, alongside residential towers, education centres and museums such as the revamped The Burrell Collection in his home city of Glasgow. While different, each project is underpinned by human-centric architecture that improves the quality of urban life.\n\nWhen it came to conceiving this house, the McAslans were not interested in statement-making grandeur but in\u00a0creating a beautiful environment in which to live, love,\u00a0think and\u00a0work. For John, the methodology is the same. \u201cIt\u00a0was about transforming the old into new, which\u00a0is what a lot of the work of the practice is about. We\u00a0wanted\u00a0to open it up, retain what we could, set a budget\u00a0and develop a language of architecture and design\u00a0that was an expression of us,\u201d he says. \u201cThe central\u00a0idea\u00a0here was to get the energy of the house circulating front to back and retain, remodel and upcycle\u00a0what existed to varying degrees \u2013 we had an ecological, fabric-first approach.\u201d\n\nSince the early 1980s, the couple lived in four different properties in Notting Hill. As John was building his business, Dava was working in recruitment while raising three children, Hannah, Flossy and Renwick, who have now all left home. There was no\u00a0urgency to move, rather a gentle yearning for more light,\u00a0sky and a sense of expansiveness, which is hard to find\u00a0in\u00a0the densely occupied city.\n\nMoving south of the river was not on the agenda until their daughter Hannah, a lawyer who lives in the area, spotted the property and went for a recce, iPhone in hand. She sent the video to John and Dava who were on holiday at\u00a0their restored farm south of Florence. They swiftly put\u00a0in\u00a0an offer. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done that before. We\u2019re normally forensic,\u201d laughs Dava of the almost blind bid and\u00a0the serendipitous events that landed them the keys.\n\nThe core renovation with the construction company Davies & Daughters involved knocking down walls, opening up all the spaces, building out into the garden and ripping out a \u201ccircus tent\u201d conservatory. \u201cIt was an awful octagonal makeshift \u201970s one \u2013 boiling in the summer and leaky in the rain,\u201d says John, rolling his intense blue eyes. It was reconfigured into a punched-out\u00a0space that now frames a small kidney-shaped garden landscaped by Jack Newlyn and enclaved by bamboo and neighbouring trees.\n\nThe first floor hosts John and Dava\u2019s bedroom, a private sitting room and an emerald-Bisazza-tiled en suite bathroom with a curvilinear wall. The top floor houses two super-size flexible sleep-living spaces for guests and family, with extended eaves that create new volumes and\u00a0light. The upstairs bathrooms are vivid lime green \u201ccubes\u201d with a painted floor, ceiling and wall in the same wake-me-up hue. \u201cThe layout of the house is clear and direct, with flexibility: the ground floor is entirely open, engaging the hall, reception spaces, extended kitchen, garden room and fully opening into and through the garden,\u201d says John, who admits he has an aversion to rooms with closed doors. \u201cThe first floor is our apartment, and the top floor is a suite of connected spaces that can open or close as needs be.\u201d \u201cI feel I can use every room,\u201d says Dava. \u201cThere are times when I take my laptop and go all the way up to the top of the house and it\u2019s just great.\u201d\n\nThere were a few trouble spots, including a damp, rotting cellar that required gutting and fixing to make way for a utility area. \u201cHow we avoided electrocution, I don\u2019t know!\u201d says Dava of the early renovation. They moved in permanently in March 2024. Perhaps unusually, the couple were aligned on pretty much all aspects, including the wood-panelled walls and simple single strips of shelving (by John Cherrington of Windmill Furniture) that feature throughout. The Strong White (Farrow & Ball) wall paint changes with the light, accented by breezy voile curtains, citrus-green blinds (that beam optimism from the street view) and the wide oak floorboards.\n\nThe couple first met in the late 1970s in Boston at the canteen of the architectural practice Cambridge Seven Associates, where John had just landed an internship as a\u00a0recent graduate from Edinburgh University. Dava was working as an executive assistant to one of the partners. It was a coup de foudre. \u201cI\u00a0said to myself, well, I\u2019m going to marry her. This was she! So I stayed my year and I think on the last day I asked you out or something,\u201d smiles John, who returned to London to work at Richard Rogers and rack up a phone bill calling his sweetheart. A transatlantic courtship ensued before Dava moved to the UK in 1981 and they wed. \u201cNot really knowing each other, but enough to know,\u201d laughs Dava. \u201cThis was not anything I ever planned when I was burning my bra with my feminist sisters: a, to get married; or b, to marry someone I didn\u2019t know very well.\u201d\n\nThe couple share a love of adventure, travel, family and collecting that is writ large in their collection of furniture, art and artefacts. The cane and teak furniture is a combination of original armchairs designed by Pierre Jeanneret for Chandigarh in the 1950s, with a number of pieces recently made by Phillips Antiques in India in reclaimed teak. The wooden screens by Artek were designed by Alvar Aalto in 1936, and they own a standout Brazilian petal table by Jorge Zalszupin from the 1960s. \u201cWe dressed the interiors with an array of panelled wall assemblies \u2013 some open and some closed \u2013 for our library. The artefacts, collected over time and very personal to us, express our journey individually and as a family,\u201d says Dava.\n\nThere is a luminescent collection of Bakelite pieces (many found in Martha\u2019s Vineyard) perched on cabinets; a\u00a0vintage Missoni rug alongside colourful abstract floor coverings, some sketched by John and handwoven by Shyam Ahuja in Mumbai. The artworks, casually leaning on the narrow shelves and coursing up the stairwells, range from an exquisite sketch of two female bottoms by\u00a0their daughter Flossy (John swears it is better than Klimt) to contemporary Indian abstract painters, and a\u00a0very early American 1869 Shield, Eagle and Flags stamp\u00a0(one of a series purchased for their children) to\u00a0celebrate Dava\u2019s US roots.\n\nBy contrast, there are photographic works by the Indian artist Raghu Rai, alongside Wolfgang Tillmans and Simon Starling. The couple are patrons of emerging artists and the collection is diverse, esoteric and autobiographical \u2013 with many humorous anecdotes attached. \u201cWe began collecting around 40 years ago when we first married, starting with Peter Blake\u2019s pencil studies of a lady\u2019s bottom made in 1955\u00a0when he was a student at the RCA. From there we focused on European expressionists like Paul Klee, Jean Metzinger, Erich Mendelsohn, Marc Chagall, Sonia Delaunay and Giorgio Morandi,\u201d says John. They also share a love of abstract Indian painters including Ram\u00a0Kumar, Tyeb Mehta and Francis Newton Souza \u2013 a founding member of the Progressive Artists\u2019 Group.\n\nThe duo are strong believers in community and in preservation. In 2010, they fundraised \u00a33.5mn with the local community in Argyll to save Dunoon Burgh Hall, an\u00a01874 arts venue in the seaside town of Dunoon, where\u00a0John grew up. The building was in danger of being\u00a0torn down, so they bought it for \u00a31. It is now a thriving cultural hub and there are plans to establish a library and archive centre with their vast collection (around 2,500) of architectural and art books. McAslan is also lobbying the GLA and central government as part of a Social and Affordable Housing Initiative calling for the adaptive reuse of redundant \u201cgrey belt\u201d office space (estimated at 24mn sq ft) as a sustainable alternative to the push for new-build homes.\n\nOne of the biggest eye-openers for John is the newfound joy of crossing the Thames en route to work. \u201cI\u00a0think of the Kinks and \u2018Waterloo Sunset\u2019, romantic meetings and all that stuff. But the big change is having that distance between work and home,\u201d he says. Not to mention the novelty of using the Overground and Underground. \u201cWhen he first got on the train, we thought he might not come back!\u201d says Dava. But now both have\u00a0the pleasure of coming home through an elegant front gate. Four neighbours have already inquired after its provenance. \u201cIt is our gate!\u201d they laugh in unison.", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/25a6aafa-9d69-43b8-b431-db2eab307346"}, {"uuid4": "9000925d-2e78-42ca-ac61-77e4d6c94686", "title": "Chimney sweeps and mouse men should stigmatise the rest of us ", "description": "It is wise to acknowledge their deep understanding of nature and the elements", "author": "Ella Risbridger", "published_date": "2025-01-25T05:00:52.494Z", "content": "The writer is an author of fiction, cookery books and poetry anthologies.

It feels like a particularly bruising battle on both sides: impossible not to root for better air quality, but equally impossible not to understand that the days are short and the nights are wild, and the rush of a real wood fire feels like the only thing that might see you through to spring. A friend\u2019s toddler daughter, having never seen a real fire, caught a glimpse of Netflix\u2019s Fireplace For Your Home: Crackling Birchwood Fireplace. She ran off, fetched her little chair, and pulled it up close to the screen: totally transfixed. We stole it from the gods for a reason, and \u2014 Brighton council might say \u2014 they kept it from us for a reason, too.\n\nFire is always dangerous, one way or another, and the only difference between the fire we want (cosy, contained) and the fire we fear (house-consuming) is the chimney sweep. The chimney sweep, however far away you make him park, knows things you don\u2019t know about fire; about smoke; and how thin a line there is between civilisation and what simmers beneath.\n\nIt\u2019s funny that it\u2019s taken this long for chimney sweeps to dip into the stigma associated with all the other ways wildness takes over a home: nobody likes to have the exterminator parked outside; nobody wants the neighbours to know they\u2019ve had to call pest control. What if they think their mice came from inside our walls? I have, as a long-term city dweller, had to call both bedbug man and pest control in my time: bedbug man mutely fogged our home, white-suited and booted, while we took our shame out of town for the weekend.\n\nThe mouse man was a different \u2014 and wiser \u2014 story. He looked like something out of a Roald Dahl book: small, bright-eyed, and with a large, silent son in tow. \u201cFourth generation!\u201d The son nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s learning the trade,\u201d he said. The son nodded. \u201cTell the ladies how a rat ran up your arm last week, Stephen!\u201d Stephen mutely held out an arm. The mouse man beamed with pride. \u201cWhen I was his age, I thought I\u2019d be the world\u2019s first no-kill mouse man,\u201d he said, tucking little square boxes of poison into the kitchen corners. \u201cTried everything. Can\u2019t be done! You have to fight with everything you\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nHe was in his heart, he confessed, a photographer. Mainly of flowers, but other botanicals also. Some animals. He showed us the pictures on his phone. They were lovely. \u201cBut you can\u2019t quit a job like this. The mice always come back.\u201d He looked thoughtfully around our flat. \u201cMy dad did this one. So did granddad. Stephen\u2019ll do it in 10, 20 years.\u201d This exact house? This exact house.\n\n\u201cWe just keep fighting with everything we\u2019ve got,\u201d said the mouse man, cheerfully. \u201cYou done them boxes, Stephen?\u201d Stephen nodded. Then, to us: \u201cDid you follow my Instagram?\u201d We nodded. \u201cBest get on,\u201d said the mouse man. \u201cLots to do!\u201d Off he went, his son at his heels, following in the footsteps of his forefathers.\n\nAs we all do, if you think of it in primeval terms. More ancient than the Victorian chimney sweep, we can\u2019t get away from the stuff that goes deep: the desire for fire, the fight against the wild, and the hope that nobody will cast us out, with our shame, into the darkness ourselves.", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/59c79772-d956-4fc7-a0a0-1b16273188b5"}, {"uuid4": "f5ccf181-a598-4a52-92bc-ac6aa90811f2", "title": "Drugmakers warn NHS clawback tax is putting UK at a disadvantage", "description": "Pharma groups say higher levy will stifle growth of life sciences", "author": "Hannah Kuchler", "published_date": "2025-01-25T05:00:52.492Z", "content": "Drugmakers are growing frustrated with the NHS after a clawback tax unexpectedly soared, with pharmaceutical companies warning that investment in the UK may be at risk.\n\nThe industry association\u2019s chief executive and board met with health secretary Wes Streeting last week to complain about having to pay 22.9 per cent of their UK sales back to the government this year, far more than the 15 per cent predicted.\n\nThe tax rate changes annually and the new rate surprised drugmakers when it was published late last year, after they had made their budgets for this year.\n\nIn 2024, the rebate tax was 15.1 per cent, and the year before that, under the previous agreement between the health department and the industry, it was 26.5 per cent.\n\nNHS England said purchases of potentially curative cell and gene therapies, and medicines for conditions including cancer, diabetes, eye diseases rose more than expected in 2024, which led to the rise in the tax rate.\n\nRichard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said he would like to review the deal, as the UK lags behind other European countries in what it pays for drugs, putting it in a \u201cvery very difficult position\u201d if it wants to grow its life sciences industry.\n\n\u201cThere comes a point where the NHS has to be at least in the ballpark of being a good customer. Not necessarily the best in the world, but it is really hard if the NHS is the worst,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe can only continue to add billions to GDP in this country and create more medicines for the future if we make sure the system is working well for life sciences,\u201d Torbett added.\n\nOne senior figure at a major pharmaceutical company said the impasse was already making the company reconsider investment in clinical trials and the launch of new drugs in the UK.\n\nThe person warned that the higher rate of taxation would challenge Streeting\u2019s goal of positioning health as a \u201cgrowth department\u201d, adding that it sent a \u201c\u2018do not invest here\u201d sign to life sciences.\n\nFiona Bride, interim chief commercial officer at NHS England, said the voluntary scheme for branded medicines pricing and access had been a \u201ctriple win\u201d for patients, taxpayers, and the life sciences sector.\n\nShe added that the higher rate showed the deal is working as intended because it is delivering more new medicines to patients. Estimated sales of new drugs rose from \u00a37.8bn in 2023 to \u00a38.9bn in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe NHS is delivering more newer branded drugs to patients as companies have brought forward new innovative treatments at cost effective prices,\u201d she said.\n\nThe UK is home to world-leading scientific research, particularly in the \u2018Golden Triangle\u2019 of Oxford, Cambridge and London, and large pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and GSK.\n\nBut efforts to encourage the life sciences industry to grow have faltered because of concerns over the NHS not adopting new medicines quickly enough and paying less than other countries.\n\nGermany charges the industry a similar clawback tax but recently lowered it to 7 per cent of sales and Ireland\u2019s tax is 9 per cent.\n\nAfter months of tense negotiations in 2023, the pharmaceutical industry and the government reached an agreement on a five-year deal on pricing.\n\nThe senior figure at a pharmaceutical group said that when the tax deals were signed last year, only the Department of Health was able to provide modelling, and the scenarios presented to pharmaceutical companies were \u201cmisleading\u201d.\n\nThey added that pharmaceutical groups were frustrated because the NHS had received its biggest cash injection in decades in the Autumn Budget. \u201cA massive budget increase has been given with zero added to the medicines budget,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThe pharma industry are really pissed off,\u201d said one person familiar with the matter.\n\nMark Dayan, head of public affairs at the think-tank the Nuffield Trust, said the agreement was based on the principle of variable rates based on sales trends for newer medicines.\n\n\u201cThis provides an element of predictability and control over the medicines bill and in all four countries of the UK, the NHS budget is extremely tight, often with overspends, so it will be a difficult conversation to think about reopening that deal so soon after it was signed,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said this rise is close to the clawback rates seen in the last year of the old deal, which were hitting up against the limits of what was acceptable to pharma companies.\n\nThe Department of Health said the pharmaceutical sector plays a vital role supporting the NHS and boosting UK growth: \u201cWe look forward to continuing to work in partnership with companies to tackle these together wherever we can\u201d.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nUK pharma groups try to have their cake and eat it / From Mark Samuels, Chief Executive, British Generic Manufacturers Association, London EC2, UK", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3a9f44c7-995d-4b94-98cf-b157db73cbd6"}, {"uuid4": "833108c0-8c81-419a-b410-5e2a85bb1009", "title": "The Southport case puts our definition of terrorism on trial", "description": "Pre-empting violent crime might be possible in some circumstances if we categorise them differently", "author": "Jonathan Hall", "published_date": "2025-01-25T05:00:52.442Z", "content": "The writer is the UK\u2019s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation\n\nThe case of the Southport killer Axel Rudakubana raises urgent questions about how the law should apply to users of extreme violence for its own sake. Various arguments have been made in favour of amending the terrorism definition.\n\nFirst, it might be an appropriate label because only \u201cterrorism\u201d captures the social revulsion at Rudakubana\u2019s acts of violence. Second, it might help prevention, pulling in the superior resources and capabilities of the UK counter-terrorism apparatus.\n\nThird would be a legal function, possibly unlocking greater investigative powers and widening the net of criminal liability to allow police intervention and prosecution before an attack can occur. For example, a lone actor who takes early steps to a mass slaughter commits an offence \u2014 but only if it is defined as terrorism. Each argument merits real consideration but each has drawbacks, quite possibly terminal.\n\nIf the present definition of terrorism is thought to be too narrow because it does not apply to extreme violence for its own sake, a new test will be needed to distinguish between it and ordinary crime. The current test \u2014 which requires a motive of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause \u2014 tackles attempts to change our way of life through violence. Terrorism without subversion is a very different proposition, but the current definition is still wider than it seems. It does apply to new, internet-driven ideologies that justify ultraviolence, even though they may be unfamiliar and therefore harder to spot, such as end-of-days anti-system dogma, and certain variants of Satanism and \u201cincel\u201d-related beliefs.\n\nSir Keir Starmer this week floated the possibility of a new test: \u201cviolence clearly intended to terrorise\u201d. This risks too many false positives, such as domestic violence, unless the intended target is clearly the wider public not the immediate victim. Even this would still catch extortion by criminal gangs and serious hooliganism. The prime minister is, however, right about factoring in desire for notoriety, a major motivator in US school massacres.\n\nAs to resources, a wider definition will not automatically focus counter-terror police and MI5 manpower on future Southports. The national security apparatus has major threats to manage, including Isis-K and Russian sabotage. Unless the amendment was very tight, the system could be overwhelmed with dangerous and apparently dangerous individuals, vying for attention as potential terrorists.\n\nPerhaps few would argue with extending investigative powers to avert atrocities: allowing 14-day pre-charge detention in suitable cases, suspicion-less stops at air and seaports, and applying terrorism offences like possession with intent or preparatory acts to violence-obsessed individuals. But doing so would expand the harshest powers of the authorities, and the authorities can make mistakes about human motivation.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, terrorism legislation does not just apply to violence, so every inciter, encourager or publisher of atrocity-promoting material would become a terrorist, liable to special post-release measures. Complaints are already made about the scope of UK terrorism laws. Although I support the current definition as workable and adaptable, I would be cautious about pushing the law too far.\n\nPossibly the solution lies in borrowing from the tactics of counter-terrorism. Where a \u201csubject of interest\u201d is on the books, police use a range of tactics to disrupt or deter, by prosecuting non-terrorist offending or imposing anti-social behaviour injunctions. Rudakubana\u2019s danger was fizzing off him, but after he exited Prevent, the deradicalisation programme designed to divert potential extremists away from violence, there was no one to manage this risk. By which I don\u2019t mean longer-term interventions such as therapy or medical help and family support, but immediate public protection by law enforcement.\n\nThis is not about definitions, it\u2019s an organisational issue and I think a major one. It suggests the need for a wholly new capability to deal with those motivated by non-instrumental extreme violence. Operating at regional and national level, it would sit alongside counter-terrorism and serious and organised crime but separate from both.\n\nThen there is Prevent. Invented with al-Qaeda in mind, the multi-agency programme has uneasily juggled proto-terrorists and violence-lovers for years. It has been stretched to maximise police contact with school massacre obsessives and young people without any single identifiable terrorist motivation.\n\nEven if non-terrorist violence is kept within Prevent, there is a serious need for humility and imagination in the face of internet influence. Children in their bedrooms are tempted to violence by images, peer-to-peer chat and dark transgressive humour absorbed over hours and hours online. Today\u2019s reality makes the traditional model of deradicalisation years out of date.", "tag": "world-uk?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/91fc342d-7ccb-4613-b786-90bb4e20484e"}, {"uuid4": "c2d4d0c8-0a86-4cf3-80f9-3d6466be3aa2", "title": "Bereaved people in England face long waits for counselling", "description": "Convoluted NHS systems mean some patients are left without support for months, as demand for services rises  ", "author": "George Hayes", "published_date": "2025-01-25T05:00:52.287Z", "content": "People whose loved ones have died face waits of several months for bereavement counselling, \u201celongated\u201d by unwieldy NHS systems.\n\nNHS \u201ctalking therapies\u201d, which are recommended by GPs to people seeking support with bereavement in England, were set up primarily for anxiety and depression sufferers, the clinical director of the UK\u2019s leading bereavement charity has said.\n\nAndy Langford of Cruse said that people referred to talking therapies by their GP must wait for a general assessment before being referred for a second time to a specialist bereavement provider. \u201cIn the vast majority of instances, a talking therapy service will go: \u2018we don\u2019t work with grief so you\u2019re going to have to go to Cruse\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nIt could take a couple of weeks for the charity to allocate a trained bereavement volunteer or several months, he noted.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s waiting time is elongated by having to wait for talking therapies to do the assessment and then the conversation [to say] that\u2019s necessarily not the right service. Then they refer on to us or another provider,\u201d Langford said.\n\nDemand for bereavement support is rising, say charities. More than a quarter of a million people called The Samaritans in 2023 seeking bereavement support.\n\nWaiting times for talking therapies were six weeks or less for 92 per cent of referrals, according to recent NHS data. But many say they have to wait far longer for the right support.\n\nCruse has 83 branches in England, covering 60 per cent of areas. It also operates in Northern Ireland and Wales. The bereavement charity supported more than 22,000 people one-to-one in 2022 but is now struggling with demand.\n\nHannah Coom lost her mother to cancer in March 2024 and found herself caught between different services. She sought support from an Essex hospice but encountered a 10-month wait.\n\nThe 28-year-old instead chose to see a GP but was told to wait six months before seeking general counselling. \u201cBut the reason I went to the GP instead of the hospice was because I was so unwell,\u201d she said.\n\nFive months after her mother\u2019s death, she was contacted by NHS talking therapies personnel. She had two-to-three rounds of assessment before they decided she needed \u201cemployment support\u201d. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t actually get any talking therapy sessions,\u201d she added.\n\nHaving passed the six-month \u201ccheckpoint\u201d, Hannah, who said she had experienced suicidal thoughts, saw a second GP who left her without the support she needed.\n\n\u201cI was turned away from that appointment with nothing, that if I didn\u2019t want to take antidepressants then there was nothing else they could do for me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still having symptoms of inability to sleep, flashbacks, nightmares. I\u2019ve just found myself to feel continually shocked that a person can be in so much pain and going to so many places asking for help and there isn\u2019t anything.\u201d\n\nAmelia Wrighton co-founded her charity Suicide&Co in 2020 to help people bereaved by suicide, nine years after her mother took her own life. \u201cWhen we did our research into the sector, there was just a gaping hole in service provision for people bereaved by suicide,\u201d she said.\n\nDemand for Suicide&Co services has soared since its creation, with wait times tripling from two to six weeks last year.\n\nCruse experienced similar trends during the Covid pandemic. Langford said demand initially dropped in 2020 when people parked their \u201cemotional needs\u201d to prioritise physical health but struggled to meet demand when services moved online during lockdown. The emergence of \u201csuppressed emotional experiences\u201d post-crisis had resulted in a demand surge.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any big grants, there isn\u2019t an NHS contract\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009effectively what we\u2019re doing is subsidising the NHS,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cLosing a loved one can significantly impact our lives\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009which is why we\u2019ve invested record amounts into bereavement services and suicide prevention,\u201d said Claire Murdoch, NHS England\u2019s national director for mental health.\n\nThe NHS has invested \u00a357mn into suicide prevention and bereavement services during 2019-2024.

He\u2019s in a very rough part of the world, to be honest. As they say, it\u2019s a rough neighbourhood. But I think he would do it, and I think the King of Jordan would do it too.\u201d\n\nEgypt denied \u201cwhat some media outlets reported\u201d about the call between the two leaders. Since Trump first made the suggestion over the weekend, Cairo and Amman have vehemently rejected the idea, arguing it would undermine Palestinians\u2019 long-held hopes of establishing their own state and the security of their own countries.\n\nAnalysts said Trump\u2019s comments, which came just days after secretary of state Marco Rubio ordered an immediate halt to work on virtually all US foreign aid programmes, underscored the potential leverage Washington had over both Egypt and Jordan, as well as the US president\u2019s willingness to flex it.\n\n\u201cThis a classic Trump negotiation tactic, coming in with an extreme position in order to\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009get somewhere in the middle,\u201d said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and north Africa programme at Chatham House. But she said Trump\u2019s demands touched on \u201creal existential\u201d questions for both Jordan and Egypt.\n\nOn Tuesday, the front page of Egypt\u2019s state-owned Al-Ahram daily featured a large picture of displaced Palestinians streaming back to north Gaza with the headline: \u201cEgypt [speaks] as one man: The people reject displacement and support efforts to protect national security as the Palestinians write their \u2018epic of return\u2019.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, was similarly dismissive, saying on Sunday that \u201cthe solution to the Palestinian issue lies in Palestine\u201d.\n\n\u201cJordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians,\u201d he said.\n\nArabs have for more than a year warned against any moves to push Palestinians out of Gaza, saying it would be akin to 1948, when hundreds of thousands were forced from their homes or fled in the fighting that accompanied Israel\u2019s founding. Palestinians refer to that period as the Nakba, or catastrophe.\n\nMichael Wahid Hanna, director of the US programme at the International Crisis Group, said that while it was not clear how far Trump would go, one pressure point on Egypt would be the $1.3bn of annual military assistance received by Cairo to buy US weapons and spare parts for US materiel purchased in previous years.\n\nThe assistance, which started in 1978 when Cairo took the first steps towards a peace deal with Israel, signed the next year, has been \u201cthe backbone of ties\u201d, said Hanna. It has amounted to more than $50bn over the years.\n\nMilitary assistance to Egypt and Israel has been exempted from the three-month hold on international aid announced by Rubio.\n\nHanna added that if Trump tried to coerce Egypt into taking Palestinians displaced from Gaza, it would be a \u201cbig change to the relationship\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe US has worked for a very long time on the assumption that it would be dangerous for Egypt and was something to avoid,\u201d he said. When the idea of resettling Palestinians was floated at the beginning of the Gaza war, he added, Egypt argued it could threaten domestic stability because neither the military establishment nor public opinion would approve.\n\n\u201cA massive influx of Palestinians would raise fears of rekindling the insurgency [by an Isis affiliate] in the Sinai because of a mixing of Palestinian and Egyptian militants,\u201d said Hanna.\n\nAnalysts said the US could use similar pressure against Jordan, where Washington is the biggest provider of foreign aid, on which Jordan\u2019s fragile economy is heavily dependent.\n\nAccording to the US embassy in Amman, the US has provided $31bn of bilateral assistance since relations were established in 1949, and the two countries recently signed a memorandum of understanding under which Washington would provide $1.45bn a year until 2029.\n\nDiplomats said officials in Amman were rushing to understand Trump\u2019s intentions, and that in addition to withholding aid, the US could also apply pressure by imposing tariffs. \u201cGiven where Jordan\u2019s economy is at the moment, any move could have a bigger impact than you might think,\u201d said one.\n\nA large influx of Palestinians would have significant ramifications for Jordan\u2019s delicate political and economic situation: the 11mn-strong country is already home to more than 2mn Palestinians, while its economy has been strained by the cost of supporting hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees.\n\nImplementing Trump\u2019s idea would \u201creally threaten security dynamics in both countries, and the political legitimacy of the leaders\u201d, Vakil said.\n\n\u201cIt will be very hard [for them] to kowtow on these issues and see a quick turnaround like we have seen in the case of Colombia or Canada [when pressured by Trump]. This is a very different dynamic.\u201d", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/45aeb5db-d1e3-46f5-bee6-029a30e19bf6"}, {"uuid4": "66a88019-4ae8-4bf4-91d1-4ef5747fbb9d", "title": "Will the US working class pay the price for \u2018America First\u2019 policies?", "description": "Also in today\u2019s newsletter, Robert F Kennedy Jr allies fear he has failed to win over senators ", "author": "Steff Ch\u00e1vez", "published_date": "2025-01-28T14:01:47.962Z", "content": "Good morning and welcome to White House Watch! Today let\u2019s get into:\n\nFighting inflation is quickly falling down the list of President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities as he pursues his isolationist policies at a clip.\n\nVoters consistently ranked economic issues including the cost of living as the most important issue in deciding their choice for president, according to the FT-Michigan Ross poll. But those voters are set to be disappointed, economists have warned, as Trump pursues aggressive tariffs.\n\n\u201cThe policies he\u2019s pursuing have a high risk of inflation,\u201d Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics think-tank, told the FT\u2019s Claire Jones. Instead, attacking US trade partners is \u201ca higher priority than the purchasing power of the working class\u201d.\n\nEconomists, on average, have revised up their inflation projections from 2.2 per cent to 2.6 per cent for 2025, according to forecast aggregator Consensus Economics, on signals that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d protectionism will raise prices. In this scenario, the US Federal Reserve could be left struggling to cut interest rates, which Trump is pressuring chair Jay Powell to do.\n\nIf rates don\u2019t come down quickly, there could be fresh tensions between the two men. Fed officials are almost certain to hold interest rates steady at their meeting tomorrow \u2014 and the median view among rate setters is that there\u2019ll be only two quarter-point cuts this year.\n\nDuring the past several years, US consumers experienced price increases of more than 20 per cent \u2014 the worst inflation surge in a generation.\n\n\u201cIf you really thought this guy was going to do something about the price of eggs, then you are probably going to be brutally disappointed,\u201d said Mark Blyth, professor at Brown University. \u201c[His stance is] \u2018We can\u2019t give you cheap groceries, but we can give you the Gulf of America\u2019.\u201d\n\nAnother thing economists are worried about: what will happen to inflation if and when the president\u2019s mass deportations come about, since worker shortages usually raise wages.\n\nThere are roughly 11mn undocumented people in the US, and deporting them all is a central pillar of Trump\u2019s Maga agenda. But a genuine mass deportation could also face enormous financial, legal and logistical hurdles at every step of the process: identification, apprehension, detention and expulsion [free to read].\n\nEven at an improbable rate of deporting 1mn people annually, it would take more than 10 years and cost almost $1tn, according to the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration non-profit group. Lawsuits are also expected at every turn.\n\n\u201cThe idea of 1mn to 2mn [deportations] a year is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009aspirational. It\u2019s probably unrealistic, given the resources that are available to do it,\u201d Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a predecessor agency to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told me. \u201cThe numbers are not likely to be dramatically greater [than they are now], at least for a while.\u201d\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, under the Biden administration, Ice deported 271,484 unauthorised immigrants, a 10-year high. The peak under Trump\u2019s first term was 267,000 in fiscal year 2019. Trump and his border tsar, Tom Homan, have said they will prioritise people with criminal histories, a more politically palatable way to get started.\n\nThe administration has already launched showy raids in Chicago, and went to the brink of a trade war with Colombia after Bogot\u00e1 rejected military repatriation flights. The dramatic clash left Latin American nations reeling as they prepare for an emergency summit on Thursday to respond to mass deportations.", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/cad08dc0-737b-4da3-948d-7f265f479615"}, {"uuid4": "ece2e426-3b5a-4394-aea2-4e369f37cfd6", "title": "Trump and the Dr Strangelove experiment", "description": "The president revels in his unpredictability but over time he risks sowing distrust in America\u2019s good faith", "author": "Edward Luce", "published_date": "2025-01-28T12:15:53.473Z", "content": "Do as I say or I might be crazy enough to blow everyone up. That is the essence of the Dr Strangelove playbook \u2014 that acting the madman will scare your enemies into concessions. In the movie, budget-constrained US generals save dollars by nuking the Soviet Union. Donald Trump is highly unlikely to launch nuclear weapons. But he would surely be happy if others thought that he might. Nor is he insane for believing the Strangelovian approach might work. It has served him well for his first 78 years.\n\nThere is no need to retread how a serially bankrupted Trump menaced creditors during his casino days, or how supporters storming Capitol Hill to stop the count became a rallying cry for his re-election. Playing the lunatic has been a routine tool of Trump\u2019s career. Never give the middle finger to your creditors; avoid at all costs describing fallen soldiers as losers. Had Trump heeded such advice he would not be president. In his mind, reasonable people are clueless about power and negotiating. \u201cIt is the rational optimist who fails, the irrational optimist who succeeds,\u201d wrote GK Chesterton. \u201cHe is ready to smash the whole universe for the sake of itself.\u201d\n\nReactions to Trump\u2019s first week in office are unlikely to damp his instinct for unpredictability. His avalanche of executive orders, collective firings and sweeping pledge to usher in a new golden age was meant to give the shock and awe impression that he was remaking the world. One of Trump\u2019s billionaire donors even compared his first seven days to the almighty. In fact, Trump\u2019s big win \u2014 securing a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza \u2014 came several days before he was inaugurated (or said \u201cLet there be light!\u201d, depending on your grip on reality). Neither Hamas nor the Israelis cared that Joe Biden had been pushing for a ceasefire for many months. With Trump, they obeyed in advance.\n\nTrump can also claim that he shocked Colombia into accepting his terms for sending them illegal immigrants. But the moral of last weekend\u2019s scrap is fuzzier than that. Trump announced a tariff war and a visa ban on the South American republic after it refused to accept two US military planes carrying shackled deportees. President Gustavo Petro responded with florid insults while quietly sending a civilian plane to collect them. Cue Trump victory dance. In reality, Colombia has accepted hundreds of US deportee flights in recent years, which means Petro did not concede much. Yet other countries might now think twice before crossing Trump.\n\nDenmark\u2019s European neighbours have also been prompted to rethink their ideas about standing up to bullies. Trump shocked Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, by haranguing her for 45 minutes earlier this month over why the US should acquire Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. The principled stance would be for France, Britain and others to link arms with Denmark and say, \u201cEnough! America cannot trample over other countries\u2019 sovereignty.\u201d But that would be a crazy thing to do, right? Their actual response has been predictably supine. Europe\u2019s liberal democracies are behaving exactly how Trump expected they would \u2014 with fawning towards the source of the problem. They might as well have invited Trump to keep going.\n\nThe bigger test case is the Panama Canal Zone, where the US is treaty-bound to accept Panamanian sovereignty. Even if Trump browbeats Panama to revoke its ports contracts with CK Hutchison, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate, his win could be pyrrhic. Panama\u2019s president has been notably more robust than his Danish counterpart. So have Panama\u2019s neighbours. In contrast to Canada\u2019s outgoing Justin Trudeau, Mexico\u2019s president Claudia Sheinbaum set limits before Trump took office in her gutsy response to his threat of a tariff war. Colombia\u2019s Petro was also tenacious. It is no coincidence that a Chinese diplomat on Sunday said that Colombia-China relations were their strongest in 45 years.\n\nIn the short term, Trump\u2019s tactics could well yield more wins than Biden, whose diplomacy looked better on paper than in practice. It is likely that Europeans will step up defence spending for fear of Trump\u2019s ire. He has said that Russia could \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d with allies that spend too little. Over time, however, Trump will sow distrust about America\u2019s word. Deals will start to dry up. Large parts of the world long ago gave up on the notion of a US-led liberal international order, which makes them sanguine about the ascent of the \u201cugly American\u201d. Yet they will be hunting for insurance. It would be no surprise were China in the near future to win more friends and influence in Trump\u2019s hemisphere.\n\nedward.luce@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c10c0f3a-bf03-4f5b-8975-426cc37200cc"}, {"uuid4": "7bc617f6-5aaf-410b-8a91-c1ce1d560ee4", "title": "The promise and peril of an offshore digital (government) dollar", "description": "Trump\u2019s recent executive order is shortsighted", "author": "Vincient Arnold", "published_date": "2025-01-28T12:00:20.016Z", "content": "Vincient Arnold is a researcher at the Yale Program on Financial Stability and publishes research notes on his blog, Discursive Etc. The views expressed herein are his own.\n\nThe United States would seriously like to maintain the supremacy of the US dollar as an international reserve currency, and BRICS coin \u2014 unseriously \u2014 would like to replace it.\n\nWhatever the (lack of) merits of a BRICS coin, there are real, lurking challenges to the dollar\u2019s role abroad. A forward-looking response to the dollar threats of tomorrow, not just today, would be to lead the pack in the development of a cross-border wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC): ie, the offshore digital dollar. However, President Trump just signed an executive order banning the development of all CBDCs in the US, while supporting the development of stablecoins.\n\nNow, I have no qualms with the value of stablecoins in supporting the dollar system, as I\u2019ve written elsewhere. But, as experiences in the Eurodollar market have shown, privately-created money \u2014 while a great complement to central bank money \u2014 is no perfect replacement. A CBDC is still worthy of consideration, and Mr. Trump\u2019s order is, on that front, shortsighted.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced, though, that the executive order is really targeting wCBDCs in the first place? In it, CBDCs are defined as \u201ca form of digital money or monetary value, denominated in the national unit of account, that is a direct liability of the central bank.\u201d As many FT Alphaville readers are very likely aware, we already have digital money that is a direct liability of the Fed: reserves. Surely Mr. Trump is not suggesting that we get rid of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet?\n\nGiven previous Republican opposition to CBDCs, it\u2019s pretty clear that their issue is retail CBDCs \u2014 in other words, a digital form of cash \u2014 over privacy concerns. What I humbly suggest should still be on the table (and may still be, given the vague wording of the EO) is simply the crypto-ification of existing central bank reserves. It would be far from straightforward and would come with costs as well as benefits. But it seems the possibility should at least be considered, particularly given that it would be complementary to offshore dollar stablecoin issuance.\n\nHow would that differ from today\u2019s reserves? Currently, reserves are limited to US commercial banks and exist in ledger form. Unlike traditional central bank reserves, policymakers could design a wCBDC to be tokenised, meaning that the liability on the central bank balance sheet would be to whomever holds a token representing some quantum of reserves.\n\nSimilar to the distinction between checking accounts and cash, the distinction between current digital reserves and a wCBDC is that the former is account-based, whereas the latter is token-based. More radically, this wCBDC would be cross-border, with foreign banks able to hold the tokens.\n\nSuch a leap holds great appeal. The Eurodollar market \u2014 including, crucially, stablecoins \u2014 would operate on firmer ground and, given the nature of fractional reserve banking, the quantity of dollar deposits abroad would balloon, strengthening and entrenching the appeal of the dollar. More dollars abroad under a system of programmable tokens would mean more offshore transaction information \u2014 fortifying American sanctioning capacity and restricting the financing of terrorism. Broadened access to dollar accounts abroad might even help the world digest spates of ever-expanding Treasury issuance. And reasoning defensively, China already has a first-mover advantage on a cross-border wCBDC, putting the US at risk of being left behind.\n\nHow would the offshore digital dollar work? Start with the obvious design decision: access. You\u2019d probably have a tiered system, such that commercial banks in higher-risk (in an AML/CFT sense) countries with under-developed financial systems and poor bank regulation would have very limited access; moderate-risk nations would have moderate access; and so on, on a sliding scale. With tokenisation, the digital tokens would be programmed with various parameters (\u201cthis can\u2019t go to accounts in North Korea\u201d), which would aid in risk control. It would almost certainly be limited to depository institutions.\n\nThe Eurodollar market \u2014 that is, dollars created/intermediated outside of the US (including offshore stablecoins), or the offshore dollar market \u2014 has operated for decades with no official backstop from the US. Foreign commercial banks promise dollars on demand to their customers (in the form of deposits), with dollar assets backing them. But if they ran out of dollar assets? They don\u2019t have access to the Fed. There\u2019s no FDIC for the offshore dollar market. Even so, partially out of self-interest and partially in the interest of broader global stability, the Fed has episodically intervened in the Eurodollar market to provide backstop liquidity. That would very quickly need to become official.\n\nWould foreign commercial banks have access to the discount window? Almost certainly not. But there would need to be some kind of parallel system, even if it were intermediated by foreign central banks (like an expanded network of swap lines or repo facilities). If stablecoins are meant to support the dollar offshore, the need for such a formalised backstop would only grow.\n\nPrecisely because of the above, American commercial banks holding Fed reserves are supervised by the Fed. The Fed can\u2019t, and wouldn\u2019t, supervise offshore banks, so co-operation with foreign bank supervisory authorities would be crucial. The tiered system would help limit the complication, but multilateralism, in short supply these days, would be a must.\n\nDirect claims on the Fed already circulate widely around the world: crisp green cash. But that cash doesn\u2019t earn interest. In an interest-on-reserves policy world, the Fed\u2019s hand would probably be forced in remunerating all its reserves, inclusive of a tokenised wCBDC.\n\nIn practice, the Fed already in effect maintains an offshore dollar monetary policy: the floor is set by the rate on the FIMA reverse repo pool and the ceiling by the FIMA repo facility. With stablecoins offering higher rates, such an offshore wCBDC deployment would in effect create an offshore parallel to the onshore dollar hierarchy between official money and private money, interest rates and all.\n\nThe risk of volatile capital flows would pose a regulatory challenge to both stablecoins and any offshore wCBDC. If I\u2019m an emerging market central bank, and I\u2019ve sorted out capital flow regulations (and gotten the IMF off my back about it), I probably don\u2019t want a bunch of digital dollar wallets sprouting up all over the place.\n\nWhat could be worse for capital flows/foreign exchange stability than the ability for citizens to run out of their native currency into dollar accounts in their own country? Here, wCBDCs have an advantage over stablecoins and, developed in careful co-operation with foreign authorities (in potentially bespoke nature, given their programmability), could calm the nerves of host country policymakers.\n\nThe offshore digital dollar is pretty radical \u2014 more radical, perhaps, than it initially sounds. Many benefits would likely await the US, but, like everything in economics, there\u2019s no free lunch here. The peril of becoming lender of last resort to functionally the whole world, political indigestion from paying interest on the reserves, and bureaucratic complexity.\n\nYet, it\u2019s also less radical than it sounds. Direct offshore claims on the Fed already exist in the form of cash, a much dirtier dollar. And a wCBDC wouldn\u2019t be creating the offshore dollar market; it already exists. To the extent the Fed would have to provide emergency liquidity, it\u2019s unclear that\u2019s something it\u2019s not already doing.\n\nIf the plan is to have stablecoins around the world, better to pair them with an official version: the offshore digital dollar.

There was no official explanation from Iranian officials. But the move captured a quiet shift in Tehran\u2019s thinking, in what is shaping up to be its most consequential year since the 1980s Iran-Iraq war: with the country at its most vulnerable point in years, officials hope they can avoid confrontation and even strike a deal with the new president.\n\nThe return of their b\u00eate noire to the White House is happening just as Iran\u2019s long nuclear stand-off with the west comes to a head. It also follows a year of conflict that has changed the power dynamics in the Middle East at Tehran\u2019s expense, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emboldened by a string of battlefield gains that dealt the Islamic republic and its regional proxies devastating blows.\n\nIsrael, which traded two rounds of tit-for-tat strikes with Iran last year, claims to have destroyed much of its air defences; Tehran\u2019s main proxy, the Lebanese movement Hizbollah, has been debilitated; and the toppling of the Assad regime in Syria has robbed it of a key ally. With this in mind, analysts say Iran can ill-afford to antagonise Trump and risk more military conflict with Israel and even the US.\n\n\u201cIt is a very critical year, largely because the strategic context for Iran has changed drastically,\u201d said Vali Nasr, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \u201cWhat Iran has lost is a way of managing Israel and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009its hand is weaker with the Europeans and the Americans.\u201d\n\nThe expectation is that Trump, who in his first term abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal Tehran signed with world powers and ramped up sanctions in a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign, will return to his hardline policies.\n\nBut there are also hints he may be willing to bargain. Trump has delegated his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to explore whether diplomatic accommodation with Iran is possible, saying last week that \u201cit would really be nice if [tensions over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme] could be worked out\u201d.\n\nWestern diplomats say the government of reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has for weeks signalled more willingness to agree to a negotiated settlement to secure relief and ease domestic economic pressure, but also because of Iran\u2019s weakened position and desire to avoid military confrontation with the US and Israel.\n\nBut they warn that, if that fails, Iran is on a collision course with the west. European powers that opposed Trump\u2019s maximum pressure during his first term have become more angry with Iran\u2019s behaviour, including the continued expansion of its nuclear activity, its arms sales to Russia and its alleged targeting of citizens in the west.\n\nWith Iran enriching uranium close to weapons-grade level \u2014 and closer than it has ever been to having the capacity to produce nuclear bombs \u2014 diplomats say they want action not words.\n\nThe 2015 accord\u2019s \u201csunset clauses\u201d are set to expire in October, which will lift restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities and in effect signal the termination of the moribund agreement.\n\nAs that date nears, a risk for Iran is that western powers trigger the so-called snapback process that would lead to the reimposition of UN sanctions and further international isolation if there is no alternative deal.\n\nInside Iran, reformists have begun public debates to pressure Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, and the elite Revolutionary Guard to negotiate, arguing that this may be the regime\u2019s last chance to avert a crisis.\n\nPezeshkian \u201chas the opportunity to take significant steps for Iran\u201d, said Hossein Marashi, a senior reformist politician, during a speech this month. \u201cHis first mission should be a new chapter in foreign policy. We no longer hold leverage in Lebanon, Syria or Iraq.\u201d\n\nIranian analysts said, however, that Tehran does not want to be seen to negotiate out of desperation.\n\n\u201cWhile we resist US pressure, we will also signal a willingness to negotiate,\u201d said a relative of Khamenei. \u201cIran is working to minimise actions that might provoke Washington, even if no agreement is eventually reached.\u201d\n\nThe relative of Khamenei acknowledged that Israel\u2019s attacks on Iran and the so-called \u201caxis of resistance\u201d of Tehran-backed militant groups, including Hizbollah and Hamas, had led Iranian leaders to reassess their perception of the republic\u2019s power in the Middle East.\n\nBut he added that Tehran retains tools \u201cto alter the battlefield\u201d, without elaborating: \u201cThe Islamic republic has suffered blows, but there will be no strategic U-turns in its domestic and foreign policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Iranians don\u2019t see themselves as weak in the way in which they\u2019re being portrayed. They have inherent weaknesses, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Nasr said. \u201cBut they estimate that there are constraints on Trump if he doesn\u2019t pursue the diplomatic path, and that the risks are quite high for a military conflict that the US cannot then control.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump implemented his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy against Iran during his first term, Iranian forces were blamed for sabotage attacks on tankers in the Gulf and a missile and drone strike in 2019 on Saudi oil infrastructure.\n\nBut Trump also displayed his unpredictability. After initially indicating that he was not willing to use military action, he in 2020 ordered the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, Iran\u2019s most powerful commander, pushing the foes briefly to the brink of war.\n\nSome experts said the blows to the axis, which have diminished Iran\u2019s regional influence, could mean Tehran would be more willing to strike a deal with Trump to seek security guarantees that it would not be attacked by Israel.\n\nSanam Vakil, director of the Middle East programme at Chatham House, said Tehran needed to entice Trump into a deal quickly if it was to avoid more US \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d and the threat of further Israeli strikes.\n\n\u201cWithout offering something bigger, they risk a third round of strikes from Israel that will be supported by this US administration,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is the viability of the regime. The economic viability of the regime and their ability to rehabilitate themselves and build back legitimacy.\u201d", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b541826e-ab90-4b4d-b81c-fcecf3eea56f"}, {"uuid4": "c520c551-6395-4804-80cf-68007c8eb95c", "title": "DeepSeek and the dollar are spoiling \u2018Trump trades\u2019 ", "description": "If it turns out the moat around US tech stocks is not as deep as investors had hoped, the AI fairytale will unravel", "author": "Katie Martin", "published_date": "2025-01-28T09:19:03.495Z", "content": "Hours ahead of the reinauguration of Donald Trump as US president last week, Goldman Sachs hosted its annual investment summit in its London office, and one big so-called Trump trade kept on cropping up: the dollar.\n\nThe new US president\u2019s economic policy platform remains tough to parse or predict in any kind of detail. But investors, especially speculative hedge funds, have been pretty settled on the idea that Trump means a strong buck \u2014 the result of American exceptionalism, stubborn inflation, or both.\n\nFor many clients it is, as one of the bank\u2019s most senior traders outlined to the assembled fund managers, \u201cthe most obvious trade in the world\u201d, especially in relation to the Chinese renminbi.\n\nLater that same day, Trump made his way back to the White House. On his way, at the inauguration ceremony, he returned to his precious topic of tariffs \u2014 one of the key policies that snagged him his historic election victory. This time, however, it came with one big problem for the \u201cobvious\u201d trade: Trump directed his toughest intentions at Mexico and Canada, not China, which he has previously suggested was the main target.\n\nCue a sizeable jump in the Chinese currency that has fuelled a drag on the dollar across the board. The euro, sterling and yen have all picked up from recent lows \u2014 an alarming development for dollar bulls.\n\nThis is far from the only supposedly slam-dunk strategy for the president\u2019s second stint in the White House that has run into early trouble.\n\nThe message in the run-up to the reinauguration of Donald Trump has been that his zeal for deregulation, low taxes and American goods for American consumers all add up to a strong positive case for buying and holding US stocks in preference to the rest of the world. The icing on the cake is the artificial intelligence revolution, forged in the US and dominated by US-listed companies. Some investors see it as not just a commercial imperative but a strategic geopolitical imperative to stick as closely as possible to this theme.\n\nThen came the latest market shock: the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese challenge to US hubris in artificial intelligence. This took a little while to really get on to investors\u2019 radar. But at the start of this week, it did so with a bang, sending US tech stocks sliding fast. The market value of Nvidia alone sank by more than $600bn \u2014 an unprecedented daily drop for a single company. Remember: just seven AI-adjacent US stocks account for fully one-third of the entire S&P 500 benchmark index of US equities. If it turns out that the moat around them, and particularly around chipmaker Nvidia, is not as wide or as deep as investors had hoped, this whole fairytale starts to unravel.\n\nFrench bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale points out that without Nvidia and its top four customers \u2014 Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta \u2014 the entire US benchmark index would be some 12 per cent below where it is today. With \u201cAmerican exceptionalism in full force\u201d, as Manish Kabra, head of US equity strategy at the bank put it, it is little wonder that broad US markets are feeling the pain. Tilting towards an equal-weighted S&P 500, rather than the standard version favouring monster-size tech stocks, makes sense here, he added.\n\nIgnoring markets outside the US is also unwise. The main stocks indices in Germany and the UK have struck new record highs since Trump took office. There is life in the rest of the world after all. But any challenge to US Big Tech has the power to be seriously destabilising for all markets.\n\nA stumbling dollar and unusually wobbly US stocks are an ugly blow for anyone who expected this to be an easy ride, and a painful reminder that when it comes to managing money in the era of Trump 2.0, no one really knows anything. Whether you are a hedge fund manager or a have-a-go amateur investor, in this environment, you stick to your convictions at your peril.\n\nUS Big Tech, a powerful dollar and US dominance over puny overseas stock markets were all a nice, neat, satisfying story to accompany the new Trump era, and investors of all stripes embraced it with great vigour. \u201cOther than the almighty, who has achieved more in seven days than [president] Trump?\u201d fawned investor Bill Ackman in an X post over the weekend.\n\nSuch cringe-inducing hyperbole is tough to stomach, but it is a timely prompt to consider what the chosen one will do in the next seven days, and the seven days after that, and whether your portfolio of \u201cobvious\u201d Trump trades can handle the pain.\n\nkatie.martin@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b96f6962-3c2b-4bcf-96c1-4cf5fd08bfdd"}, {"uuid4": "3e1c289b-adee-4c63-8f5e-e22ab3e0cab5", "title": "EU and Nato take vow of silence on Greenland", "description": "Denmark urges other European capitals to resist reacting to Donald Trump\u2019s threats", "author": "Henry Foy", "published_date": "2025-01-28T08:16:21.977Z", "content": "The EU and Nato have taken a vow of silence over Greenland after Denmark requested its allies refrain from reacting to Donald Trump\u2019s threats to seize the Arctic island.\n\nCopenhagen\u2019s strategy of avoiding public confrontation with Trump, which four officials said was closely co-ordinated with Nato and the EU, underscores the scramble among US allies to work out how to handle the US president\u2019s pugnacious diplomacy.\n\nTrump had a fiery 45-minute phone call with Denmark\u2019s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen last week, putting Copenhagen into what officials described as \u201ccrisis mode\u201d. Trump has threatened to target tariffs against Denmark and has refused to rule out taking the Arctic island by force.\n\nTrump reiterated this weekend that he \u201cwill get\u201d Greenland \u2014 an autonomous part of the kingdom of Denmark \u2014 while mocking Copenhagen\u2019s \u201cdog sleighs\u201d defending the island, where the US has the biggest military presence.\n\nThe US, through Nato, is a military ally of Denmark with a mutual defence agreement. The EU\u2019s governing treaty also contains a mutual defence clause.\n\nDanish and European officials had initially hoped Trump\u2019s comments about taking Greenland were a tactic to gain more influence over the territory, which has increased in importance as Russia and China seek more influence in the Arctic.\n\nOfficials in recent days realised the situation \u201cshould be taken far more seriously\u201d, said one, given the global implications of Nato or the EU failing to condemn a violation of national sovereignty by one of their allies.\n\nBut Danish, EU and Nato officials have so far decided to minimise public discussion because of Copenhagen\u2019s deep sensitivities and its conclusion that openly challenging Trump will only exacerbate the crisis.\n\n\u201cA low profile seems to be the safest bet with Trump.

There have also been no efforts to co-ordinate Nato or EU statements in defence of Denmark or Greenland.\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s Greenland comments, Rutte told the European parliament last week: \u201cTrump has been right many times\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we need to dialogue with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not about who rules or controls Greenland,\u201d Rutte continued. \u201cThis is, of course, about making sure that the Arctic stays safe.\u201d Neither the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, nor European Council president Ant\u00f3nio Costa have made public statements regarding Trump\u2019s threats against Denmark.\n\n\u201cWe are not negotiating Greenland.

We live in a world of network effects and increasing returns to scale. In industries from PC software (Microsoft), internet search (Alphabet), online retail (Amazon) and social media (Meta) to high-end consumer hardware (Apple), most of the profits and market share have gone to one company. It is only a moderate exaggeration to say all that has mattered for investors in the past few decades was being on the right side of one or more of these winner-take-all stories.\n\nSo it is natural that everyone either has assumed, desired or feared that the next great technology trend, artificial intelligence, would have roughly this economic structure. What happened in markets yesterday was not an out-of-nowhere surprise, nor a panic, nor a bubble popping. It was the pricing in of slightly higher odds that AI is not a winner-take-all game.\n\nIt was always conceivable that the AI revolution would be like the invention of the automobile or the aeroplane. Those revolutions did lead to the creation of huge, durably profitable companies, but also lots of competition, ensuring that much of the value created went to consumers rather than shareholders. Now that looks like a more significant possibility for AI.\n\nMost readers will know the news by now. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, has released an AI model called R1, that is comparable in ability to the best models from companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta, but was trained at a radically lower cost and using less than state-of-the art GPU chips. DeepSeek also made enough of the details of the model public that others can run it on their own computers (but not necessarily enough that others could re-create it).\n\nThis puts three punctures in the winner-take-all theory of AI. It deflates the idea that the best AI results could only be achieved with Nvidia\u2019s best chips and software; the idea that only the biggest tech companies could afford to build and run high-quality AI models; and the idea that only companies with their own AI models could offer great AI applications.\n\nWhat kept Nvidia\u2019s stock rocketing for the past two years was sheer computational superiority. Its chips were miles better for AI. DeepSeek built R1 with Nvidia\u2019s older, slower chips, which US sanctions allow to be exported to China. This suggests the door is open to other competitors at the silicon level.\n\nNext, cost. The biggest tech companies looked more or less insulated from competition on AI because, it was assumed, the only way to build a better AI model was to train it with more inputs using more computing power, at huge expense. The finished model would then be under the control of the big company that built it. The barrier to entry was money \u2014 that is why Big Tech has gone on a data centre spending spree. But R1 suggests that companies with less money can soon operate competitive models.\n\nFinally, applications. \u201cInference\u201d is where the user really meets AI: questions answered, tasks completed. It was assumed that any application would depend on the bigger companies\u2019 models and servers for inference. But models like R1 might work well enough, and do inference efficiently enough, to run on the servers of all sorts of companies that will not need to \u201crent\u201d from a company such as OpenAI.\n\nAll this has big implications. But other than Nvidia, the big fallers yesterday were not the Magnificent Seven Big Techs. Those companies\u2019 AI halos remain squarely in place. The real damage was done to the stocks behind the emerging data centre economy. Constellation, the utility company that covers the mid-Atlantic data centre hub, Vistra, Washington state\u2019s big power provider, and NRG, the Northeast\u2019s and Texas\u2019 main player, all fell hard:\n\nGE Vernova, Eaton and Quanta Services build power systems for data centres. Oracle just announced a big data centre investment. Broadcom and Arista provide non-GPU technology to data centres.\u00a0All were whacked:\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft have all invested very heavily in AI data centres. Perhaps they have wasted some of that money \u2014 but they could be free to spend less now. Apple and Microsoft, whose natural strength might have been in building applications for AI models rather than the models themselves, could even be in a better position.\n\nNvidia itself is hardly on its knees. Its proprietary coding language, Cuda, is still the industry standard. And just because the DeepSeek model is more efficient does not mean that leaner models will not benefit from the higher computational power offered by Nvidia\u2019s best chips. While its shares dropped nearly 17 per cent yesterday, that only brings it back to the (very, very high) level of September:\n\nWe should not overstate the market\u2019s reaction to R1. The Nasdaq fell 3 per cent. That was a bad day, not a panic. The winner-take-all view of AI is wounded, not dead. The AI bubble, if that\u2019s what it is, may yet pop, but it didn\u2019t pop yesterday. Not even close.\n\nMisplaced hope.\n\nrobert.armstrong@ft.com and aiden.reiter@ft.com.", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/98e55df3-9da8-467c-950d-b469ad2ea621"}, {"uuid4": "00761437-b2f2-4bc0-9700-1635be084ed0", "title": "Wall Street\u2019s AI \u2018bubble\u2019 echoes dotcom excesses, Ray Dalio warns", "description": "Billionaire investor says US stocks are in \u2018very similar\u2019 position as lead-up to internet bust at turn of millennium ", "author": "Adam Samson", "published_date": "2025-01-28T05:01:36.464Z", "content": "Investor exuberance over artificial intelligence has fuelled a \u201cbubble\u201d in US stocks that resembles the build-up to the dotcom bust at the turn of the millennium, billionaire investor Ray Dalio has warned.\n\nDalio told the Financial Times that \u201cpricing has got to levels which are high at the same time as there\u2019s an interest rate risk, and that combination could prick the bubble\u201d.\n\nThe warning from Dalio, the founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and one of the highest-profile figures on Wall Street, comes as concerns swirl over whether the boom in US AI stocks has gone too far. Investors also remain concerned about elevated borrowing costs, worries that sharpened after Federal Reserve officials in December trimmed their expectations for rate cuts this year.\n\n\u201cWhere we are in the cycle right now is very similar to where we were between 1998 or 1999,\u201d Dalio said. \u201cIn other words, there\u2019s a major new technology that certainly will change the world and be successful. But some people are confusing that with the investments being successful.\u201d\n\nThe late 1990s saw a run-up in tech valuations, powered in part by low interest rates and growing adoption of the internet, followed by a brutal correction that came as Alan Greenspan\u2019s Fed tightened monetary policy.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index doubled in 1999, only to fall about 80 per cent by October 2002. The index has doubled since the beginning of 2023 as stocks such as AI-focused chipmaker Nvidia have powered higher.\n\nWall Street stocks slumped on Monday after DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company linked to a little-known hedge fund, published a paper claiming its newest AI model rivals those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms in performance, yet at a lower cost and with less sophisticated hardware. Nvidia shed nearly $600bn in market value on Monday.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s apparent success calls into question the potential returns on hundreds of billions of dollars invested by Silicon Valley companies in AI data centres, and whether China has managed to find a way to compete despite restrictions on its ability to import high-end chips from the US.\n\nOpenAI, backed by Microsoft, last week announced a plan to invest up to $500bn in AI infrastructure. The company\u2019s ChatGPT was the top-rated free app on the Apple app store until it was displaced on Monday by DeepSeek\u2019s AI assistant.\n\nDalio, who retired as chair of Bridgewater in 2021 but remains on the board, has long advocated economic engagement with China. He wrote last year that \u201cthe key question isn\u2019t whether or not I should invest in China so much as how much\u201d. He warned, however, that the stakes in AI are unusually high.\n\n\u201cThe tech war between China and the US is far more important than profitability, not only for economic superiority, but for military superiority,\u201d he told the FT.\n\n\u201cThose who are going to pay attention to profitability with sharp pencils are not going to win that race,\u201d Dalio added.\n\nReinforcing the elusiveness of AI profit, OpenAI founder Sam Altman wrote on X this month that the company was losing money on its $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro plan because of unexpectedly heavy usage.\n\nAs US technology groups invest lavishly, President Donald Trump has pledged to support American AI in his second term.\n\nChina has offered financial assistance for its AI industry, including the launch of funds set up to support its embattled semiconductor industry. Meanwhile, the US under former president Joe Biden extended billions of dollars of subsidies for groups to build chips on American soil.\n\nDalio conceded that state support for jockeying AI developers was inevitable given the importance of winning the global race, even it if came at the expense of profit.\n\n\u201cIn our system,\u00a0by and large, we are moving to a more industrial-complex- type of\u00a0policy in which\u00a0there is going to be government-mandated and government-influenced activity, because it is so important.\n\n\u201cCapitalism alone \u2014 the profit motive alone \u2014 cannot win this battle.\u201d", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/eef8dbc9-bd04-4502-bdc2-1092aa4251b2"}, {"uuid4": "54466f82-6da5-4df8-ab40-b3ad22fb2c4d", "title": "Why Nvidia investors are spooked by Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek", "description": "Short sellers profit as US chipmaker loses nearly $600bn in market value on Monday", "author": "Tim Bradshaw", "published_date": "2025-01-28T05:00:37.646Z", "content": "A Chinese company\u2019s claim of a $5.6mn artificial intelligence breakthrough wiped almost $600bn from Nvidia\u2019s market value on Monday, shattering Wall Street\u2019s confidence that tech companies\u2019 AI spending spree will continue and dealing an apparent blow to US tech leadership.\n\nYet many in Silicon Valley believe the broad sell-off is an overreaction to DeepSeek\u2019s latest model, which they argue could spur wider adoption and utility of AI by radically lowering the technology\u2019s cost, sustaining demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips.\n\nPat Gelsinger, recently forced out as chief executive of Intel, was among those buying his former rival Nvidia\u2019s stock on Monday. \u201cThe market reaction is wrong: lowering the cost of AI will expand the market,\u201d he said in a LinkedIn post. \u201cDeepSeek is an incredible piece of engineering that will usher in greater adoption of AI.\u201d\n\nNvidia became the world\u2019s most valuable company last year as investors bet on Big Tech companies\u2019 insatiable appetite for its powerful AI processors. The chipmaker\u2019s chief executive Jensen Huang has predicted $1tn worth of AI data centres will be built in the next few years.\n\nUnderpinning that confidence was the concept of an AI \u201cscaling law\u201d, popularised by senior leaders at AI start-ups such as OpenAI and Anthropic, that suggested AI models got smarter as they were fed more data and computing resources.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s release of its highly capable R1 model \u2014 and the research paper explaining openly how it was made \u2014 seemed to break the scaling law\u2019s spell, as its chatbot leapt to the top of the iPhone\u2019s US App Store chart over the weekend. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index shed 9.2 per cent, its worst daily drop since March 2020.\n\nChinese tech champion Huawei has emerged as Nvidia\u2019s primary competitor in China for inference chips. The Financial Times has previously reported that it has been working with AI companies, including DeepSeek, to adapt models trained on Nvidia GPUs to run inference on its Ascend chips.\n\n\u201cHuawei is getting better. They have an opening as the government is telling the big tech companies that they need to buy their chips and use them for inference,\u201d said one semiconductor investor in Beijing.\n\nThe announcement that triggered Monday\u2019s stock market spasm over Nvidia came as the US moves to assert its leadership in AI over China, and as the biggest US tech companies prepare to report their latest earnings. US President Donald Trump said DeepSeek \u201cshould be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser focused on competing to win\u201d.\n\nIn December, DeepSeek released the V3 model, which it claimed was comparable to ones from OpenAI and Google, but trained it on a fraction of the budget with $5.6mn. The Chinese company said it used just 2,048 Nvidia chips, which could have been obtained without breaching US export controls that have throttled China\u2019s access to US chipmakers\u2019 latest products.\n\nThen, last week, it unveiled its latest R1 model, a \u201creasoning model\u201d that is comparable to OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nFurther spooking investors, DeepSeek\u2019s engineers were able to unlock greater performance by writing code without relying on Nvidia\u2019s Cuda software platform, which is widely seen as crucial to the Silicon Valley chipmaker\u2019s dominance of AI development.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek has levelled the playing field,\u201d said Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer of Blue Whale Growth, the investment fund backed by billionaire Peter Hargreaves, which last month reduced its exposure to the Magnificent Seven group of big US tech companies on concerns over their huge expenditure on AI.\n\nThe biggest US tech companies \u201chave had monopoly access to AI \u2014 the entry ticket price was in the billions of dollars, otherwise there was no chance you could challenge the status quo\u201d, Yiu said. That made DeepSeek\u2019s arrival a \u201cvery positive development for the adoption, development and penetration of AI\u201d, he added.\n\nShort sellers, who have placed a flurry of bets against Nvidia\u2019s sky-high share price in recent weeks, were jubilant on Monday. Nvidia\u2019s 17 per cent share price decline generated $6.75bn in profits for short sellers, according to calculations by data group S3 Partners.\n\n\u201cA Chinese entity put out open-sourced code right before earnings of all the big American tech companies,\u201d said one short seller with interests in a number of large AI companies. \u201cThey\u2019re telling you there\u2019s no value [in those companies\u2019 AI models], it\u2019s commoditised.\u201d\n\nHowever, some analysts have challenged the idea that DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough AI was so cheap to build.\n\nDylan Patel of chip consultancy SemiAnalysis has estimated that DeepSeek and its sister company, the hedge fund High-Flyer, have access to tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, which were used to train R1\u2019s predecessors.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek has spent well over $500mn on GPUs over the history of the company,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWhile their training run was very efficient, it required significant experimentation and testing to work.\u201d\n\nG Dan Hutcheson at TechInsights said the market reaction did not reflect who was most exposed to DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a big hit to Nvidia, I see it as a bigger problem for the companies like OpenAI that are trying to sell these services,\u201d he said.\n\nNvidia argued on Monday that DeepSeek\u2019s innovations would benefit, not blow up, its business.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,\u201d Nvidia said, referring to AI systems that consume more computing resources after a user poses a question or sets a task by \u201creasoning\u201d or taking multiple linked steps to respond. \u201cInference requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.\u201d\n\nThe implication of Nvidia\u2019s statement is that by pushing the boundaries of what is possible with \u201copen-source\u201d AI models, DeepSeek has in fact grown demand for the chips that are used to run them.\n\nWhile Nvidia is best known for providing the chips that are used to \u201ctrain\u201d or build a new AI system, it has said that it now generates just as much revenue from chips for \u201cinference\u201d or processing user requests using a finished model.\n\nHuang argued on a recent podcast that demand for inference \u201cis about to go up by a billion times\u201d due to new AI models that \u201creason\u201d or take time to plan and deliver an answer to a complex query.\n\n\u201cThere are two uses for Nvidia chips, training and inference, and we\u2019re just at the beginning of the inference story,\u201d said Jordan Jacobs, co-founder of AI investor Radical Ventures, who bought more Nvidia shares on Monday as the chipmaker\u2019s stock slumped 17 per cent. \u201cAs we see the world shifting to AI it requires a huge upgrade in chips. The sell-off seems to be an overreaction and a lack of understanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe market is not properly realising this is great for Nvidia,\u201d said Dmitry Shevelenko, chief business officer at Perplexity, the San Francisco-based AI search start-up that counts the chipmaker among its investors. \u201cNo matter what, Jensen wins.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Cristina Criddle in San Francisco and Eleanor Olcott in Beijing", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ee83c24c-9099-42a4-85c9-165e7af35105"}, {"uuid4": "8b688a7b-3399-4011-908e-26edff1fee57", "title": "Pirates, wolf howls and roller-skates: New York\u2019s reimagined tiki bars ", "description": "The mid-century kitsch fest is back \u2014 but this time mainly shorn of its more problematic aspects", "author": "Joshua David Stein", "published_date": "2025-01-28T05:00:37.581Z", "content": "This article is part of FT Globetrotter\u2019s guide to New York\n\nIt\u2019s Friday night in New York City\u2019s East Village. In the 1970s, the neighbourhood was the epicentre of punk. Now, though, it\u2019s known for its urban sangfroid and urbane sophistication. Everyone is cool; maybe too cool. But inside Paradise Lost, a waiter is lighting a cocktail on fire for a table of ogling carousers. The lights flicker purple and white. The music cuts out and is replaced by a soundtrack of wolves howling and chains jangling. The waiters howl. The patrons howl. Chill this is not.\n\nParadise Lost (see below) is the latest addition to New York\u2019s new breed of tiki bars \u2014 and one of the best. As far as bar subcultures go, tiki has had a wild ride. The first tiki bar, Don the Beachcomber, was opened in 1933 in California by Ernest Gantt, a man who later renamed himself Donn Beach. He created the archetypal tiki bar: an archly kitsch pastiche of exotic influences where images of Polynesian gods and half-clad Hawaiian women in leis complemented fusion food and intricate, often rum-based cocktails, served with maximal garnish in mugs designed to look like Moai statues. The trend reached its peak in the postwar years, partially as an antidote to the uptight Eisenhower administration. But by the 1990s, the incipient awareness that tiki was, in fact, a species of cultural appropriation based on colonialism, racism and sexism, helped kill the vibe.\n\nRecently, though, bars such as Paradise Lost have tried to redefine tiki, steering clear of its troubled past while preserving the fun. As it turns out, there are many ways to go over the top. Not all are queasily fetishising. And now, when the real world is so chaotic, there can be no better time to escape into a lush, rum-powered fantasy.\n\nA flight above one of Brooklyn\u2019s best steakhouses, Gage & Tollner, its co-owner St John Frizell has carved out a pirate ship\u2019s cabin. A watery view is glimpsed from a portal; fish glisten, mid-swim, mounted on dark wood walls. Sunken Harbor is the tiki bar grown up. Sure, the lights are dim but the vibe skews heavily nautical. In fact, the space is built slightly askew to better mimic a keeling cabin.\n\nThe complex cocktails are inspired by mid-century food and drink writer Charles H Baker and are organised by strength, from In the Shadows (\u201ceasy-drinking cocktails for a pleasant moonlight swim\u201d) to The Abyss (maniacally strong and includes the Shattered Skull, a combination of rums, pomegranate, vanilla and pineapple that serves two). For tiki enthusiasts there\u2019s even a passport membership, with 36 pages of challenges.\n\n\u201cI wanted to preserve the idea that you are toying with mystical forces but without appropriating Polynesian gods,\u201d says co-owner Kav\u00e9 Pourzanjani of Paradise Lost, which opened in 2023. \u201cI settled on demonology.\u201d The effect is more Mondo Cane than Charles Manson. Pourzanjani combines elements of B-movie horror, Ed Roth\u2019s Rat Fink cartoon culture of the 1980s and DC comics. The ceiling is a fish net cluttered with ocean detritus: licence plates and model aeroplanes.\n\nThe menu, meanwhile, is almost as long as a Milton poem, and littered with illustrations of zombies. The drinks are elaborate concoctions, rated by skulls (strength), such as the Tarman, which includes three rums, falernum, cinnamon and grenadine, and Witches\u2019 Sabbath (rums, brandy, gins, tropical juices, citrus and falernum), the ordering of which triggers the flashing lights and lupine howls.\n\nDeep in Bushwick, the 16,000-square-foot Xanadu is, as one might imagine, de trop. It\u2019s a hipster pleasure dome with a roller-skating rink, tiered seats, a DJ, a state of the art sound system and a disco in the bathroom. The carpet alone, a fiesta of neon swoops, is visual overload. The endless circumambulations of the patrons are powered by tiki drinks from poet-bartender Keri Marinda Smith, whose most recent collection is called Dragging Anchor. Smith\u2019s drinks recall tropical classics: the Ladybug daiquiri, Cherry Baby (amaretto, cognac, blackcurrant and cherry) and Skaterade, a tequila-forward riff on Gatorade with blue spirulina. But beware, skating patrons have a two-drink limit.\n\nIn 2008, when Roberta\u2019s started, the now-iconic pizzeria was a punky DIY affair in an old warehouse in the then terra incognita of Bushwick. Its adjoining tiki bar was a step up from the Pabst Blue Ribbon lager and other watery domestic beers favoured by early-adopting hipsters. Now, Roberta\u2019s is an empire, with locations in Manhattan, Los Angeles, Denver, Singapore and beyond. But that no-big-deal nonchalance lives on in the original location\u2019s tiki bar. Design-wise, the tiki influence is light, though the drinks aren\u2019t. Among the crop of brightly coloured tiki riffs are the Marg Boi, made with tequila, triple sec and lime; the Young Money Melonaire (rum, Ancho\u00a0Reyes, spicy poblano, melon and Campari); and the A$AP Wa$$ail, a wintry concoction of habanero tequila and pineapple with cherry liqueur and spiced cider.\n\nPerhaps the oldest of the city\u2019s extant tiki bars, Otto\u2019s Shrunken Head opened in a former pharmacy in 2002. Once the block was peppered with bars \u2014 Irish, dive, karaoke \u2014 but now it\u2019s been given over to Target and other big box stores. Otto\u2019s, though, has survived. The small bar is illuminated by holiday lights year round, the walls are covered in sisal and the drinks are classic tiki: Mai Tais, Singapore Slings and Zombies. Just a few booths and stools, a photo booth (out of order since forever) and a video game (Big Buck Hunter II: Sportsman\u2019s Paradise) round out the feeling of a slightly dilapidated island outpost from another place and another time.\n\nHave you tried NYC\u2019s new wave of tiki bars?

I said, \u2018I disagree,\u2019\u201d he told supporters on inauguration day, arguing that immigration was a more pressing issue.\n\n\u201cIf you really thought this guy was going to do something about the price of eggs, then you are probably going to be brutally disappointed,\u201d said Mark Blyth, a professor at Brown University and the author of Inflation: A Guide For Users And Losers. \u201c[His stance is] \u2018We can\u2019t give you cheap groceries, but we can give you the Gulf of America\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Fed also thinks inflation under Trump will be stronger than it previously anticipated. Its quarterly \u201cdot-plot\u201d forecasts for December show rate-setters expected prices to rise by 2.5 per cent over the course of 2025, against an estimate of 2.2 per cent in September, before Trump was elected.\n\nThe central bank is almost certain to maintain interest rates at the target range of 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent at its vote on Wednesday, and the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets US borrowing costs, is expected to make just two quarter-point rate cuts this year.\n\nIf borrowing costs do not fall fast, then fresh conflict between Fed chair Jay Powell and the president looks likely.\n\n\u201cTrump said in Davos that interest rates are going to be lower\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009he didn\u2019t say Jerome Powell better lower them, but it wasn\u2019t very disguised,\u201d said Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and chief economic policy adviser to former Republican Senator John McCain. \u201cAnd I think the Fed\u2019s unlikely to do anything but keep interest rates on hold.\u201d\n\nChief among economists\u2019 concerns is that the effect of a post-pandemic immigration boom in helping reduce inflation will go into reverse under Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nThe president\u2019s promises to tighten border restriction, and round up and deport millions of undocumented migrants, are expected to leave construction groups across the country, and agribusinesses in south-western states, struggling to find workers.\n\n\u201cRegardless of where you stand on US immigration policy, there are a fair amount of workers in the construction industry that are illegal immigrants,\u201d said Sherwin Loudermilk, president of Loudermilk Homes, an Atlanta-based real estate developer. \u201cIf Trump has mass deportations, or people get scared, then there\u2019s going to be a void.\u201d\n\nWorker shortages usually raise wages, feeding into broader price pressures \u2014 although they could also lead to more investment in labour-saving technology, potentially enhancing productivity.\n\n\u201cTwo things could save us from inflation \u2014 one is we just get an AI productivity miracle sooner than we think, and that outweighs the other stuff,\u201d said Posen. \u201cThe other is that we get extremely unprecedented benefits from a stronger dollar.\u201d\n\nWhile a stronger dollar lowers import prices, any benefit for US consumers could be offset by higher tariffs.\n\nDivisions between moderates, such as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, and hawks, such as senior economic adviser Peter Navarro, make it difficult to predict what the president will do.\n\nOn the campaign trail Trump threatened to impose blanket levies of 10-20 per cent on all US imports. While that would raise prices, the impact might be shortlived, as long as other jurisdictions did not respond in kind.\n\n\u201cJust to put the numbers into perspective, a broad 10 per cent tariff on all US imports would raise the price level by 1 per cent,\u201d said Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Yale and former adviser to Biden, who added that such a rise would be a one-off shock that the Fed \u201cwould probably look through\u201d.\n\nOthers think aggressive action by Trump on trade could delay the reduction of interest rates.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t cut the rate while a tariff is going up,\u201d said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Investments, who expects the next Fed cut to come in June.\n\nShould Trump press ahead with plans to impose a 25 per cent levy on his southern neighbour, US citrus and vegetable agribusinesses, many of which have interests in Mexico, would need to pass on costs to customers.\n\nTrump\u2019s plans to cut taxes have also led to concerns that he risks repeating Biden\u2019s mistakes by contributing to the country\u2019s yawning fiscal deficit and stoking inflation.\n\n\u201cThere is one narrative that says US inflation was all down to the [2021] fiscal stimulus, that Biden was responsible because he spent too much on the Covid recovery,\u201d said Nicol\u00f2 Fraccaroli, a visiting scholar at Brown University, although he added that while the spending was not the only source of price pressures, it did contribute \u201ca little bit\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s big hope for lowering inflation lies in tearing up red tape. But economists and businesses believe there are limits to how much this can cut costs for households and businesses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some recent evidence that deregulation boosts growth,\u201d said Sanjay Patnaik, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think-tank. \u201cBut with inflation, at least to my knowledge, there isn\u2019t much research that paints a clear line.\n\n\u201cIt really depends on the type of regulations you\u2019re looking at,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump has directed his cabinet to \u201cmarshall all powers at their disposal\u201d to ease rules that will help tackle the soaring cost of living \u2014\u00a0including the high cost of housing.\n\nBut while construction businesses and economists widely share the president\u2019s view that America needs more affordable homes, they are not convinced his plans to loosen regulations to tackle supply shortages will solve the problem.\n\n\u201cRegulations and making it easier to get permits is important, but obviously the number one thing is interest rates,\u201d said Loudermilk.\n\nHigh borrowing costs have also meant Americans are reluctant to move, leading to further shortfalls in supply.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to refinance from a 3 per cent mortgage to 7 per cent,\u201d said Mahmood Pradhan, economist at Amundi. \u201cThose costs are going to be the prevailing factor that restrains the housing market, not regulation.\u201d\n\nTrump has claimed his biggest deregulatory push \u2014 declaring a national energy emergency to increase domestic oil and gas production \u2014 will lower the cost of all goods and services.\n\nBut weak global demand and market caution could deter investment in additional supply.\n\n\u201cThe oil and gas industry is reluctant to produce more than global markets can absorb right now. Precisely because they know that will cause commodity prices to drop sharply,\u201d said James Lucier, managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, adding that there was \u201cquite a lot of market discipline\u201d constraining fresh drilling.\n\nAdditional reporting by Valentina Romei in London", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b3d310d0-80a8-472f-a79e-8e01c2c60cfa"}, {"uuid4": "6b1b2a76-8013-4078-a3f2-660e57def4d4", "title": "Scott Bessent pushes gradual 2.5% universal US tariffs plan", "description": "Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary wants levies to rise month by month in order to give businesses time to adjust", "author": "Demetri Sevastopulo", "published_date": "2025-01-28T02:56:01.022Z", "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary Scott Bessent is pushing for new universal tariffs on US imports to start at 2.5 per cent and rise gradually, said four people familiar with the proposal.\n\nThe 2.5 per cent levy would move higher by the same amount each month, the people familiar with it said, giving businesses time to adjust and countries the chance to negotiate with the US president\u2019s administration.\n\nThe levies could be pushed up to as high as 20 per cent \u2014 in line with Trump\u2019s maximalist position on the campaign trail last year. But a gradual introduction would be more moderate than the immediate action some countries feared.\n\nThe proposal by Bessent comes as Trump\u2019s team debates how to implement tariff plans, with the president escalating his tariff rhetoric on Monday in a speech in Florida, threatening more duties on semiconductors, metals and pharmaceutical goods.\n\n\u201cWe have to bring production back to our country,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president was speaking after a day of turmoil in US stock markets, triggered by a tech sell-off as China appeared to make a leap ahead of the US in the global artificial intelligence race.His threat to impose tariffs on semiconductors entering the US would be difficult to carry out given the impact on tech companies relying on chipmakers such as Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. In contrast, Bessent\u2019s plan would see just 2.5 per cent added to tariffs each month. Two people familiar with the discussions said it was unclear if the Treasury secretary had convinced other central stakeholders, including Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s pick for commerce secretary, to adopt his proposal for a gradual introduction of tariffs.\n\nA person familiar with Bessent\u2019s thinking declined to comment on the record about the proposal, but said: \u201cHe is not drawing up any plans but if confirmed looks forward to being a part of the conversation.\u201d\n\nBessent was comfortably confirmed as the next US Treasury secretary by a Senate vote of 68-29 on Monday evening. Just hours later, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said he wanted \u201cmuch, much bigger\u201d tariffs than 2.5 per cent.\n\nTariff policy is at the centre of fierce trade debates between hawks such as Peter Navarro and Jamieson Greer, and moderates such as Bessent.\n\nTrump has threatened to force tariffs of up to 25 per cent on imports from Canada and Mexico as soon as this weekend, and in recent days threatened Colombia with 25 per cent tariffs in a dispute over deportees.\n\nAnother person familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking said he was weighing different options. \u201cThere is not a single plan the president is ready to decide on yet.\u201d\n\nWhile Bessent and other proponents of the low initial tariff believe it would give countries and companies time to adjust and negotiate, critics counter that a higher initial rate would send a clearer message.\n\nTrump made high tariffs a core of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign rhetoric last year, vowing in September to \u201ctax\u201d foreign nations \u201cat levels that they\u2019re not used to\u201d.\n\nBut since his inauguration on January 20, the president\u2019s main move has been to publish a memorandum outlining probes into US trade policy, the cause of the country\u2019s trade deficits and whether competitors are manipulating currencies and unfairly taxing US businesses.\n\nWhen asked by reporters last week whether he planned to introduce universal tariffs, Trump replied: \u201cWe may. But we\u2019re not ready for that yet.\u201d\n\nTrade analysts and lawyers have said Trump could levy universal tariffs swiftly by using executive powers such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to respond to emergencies through economic means.\n\nHowever, trade experts have also warned the use of IEEPA to issue broad tariffs would likely face legal challenges by business groups.\n\nTrump, who has long railed against the US\u2019s trade deficit, has suggested tariffs would be a way to raise revenue for the country.\n\n\u201cInstead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,\u201d he said in his inaugural address.\n\nIn his US Senate confirmation hearings last week, Bessent said the Trump administration would use tariffs to tackle unfair trade practices, raise US government revenues, and strike deals with foreign countries.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by Myles McCormick in Washington", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7fb420b9-1bd1-4c68-8575-94e99315051c"}, {"uuid4": "5f654881-70f0-4148-b0a7-a3456f2339a7", "title": "Judgment Day for the AI rally", "description": "Machine God has forsaken the US stock market ", "author": "Alexandra Scaggs", "published_date": "2025-01-27T22:22:47.627Z", "content": "Here\u2019s a parable:\n\nA powerful king decided he wanted to make a Machine God that would be omniscient and omnipotent. After lots of experimentation, the king started to make progress. Miracles started to occur. People feared that this Machine God would be unmerciful and make humanity irrelevant, or possibly end all life entirely.\n\nThe early successes only made the king more radical, however, and fuelled his obsession. Huge amounts of time, energy and ideas were sacrificed in hopes of the wealth and prosperity the Machine God could bring.\n\nAnother king nearby was working on a Machine God of his own. But he decided omniscience and omnipotence weren\u2019t his goal. Instead he wanted to make a Lesser Deity that could perform miracles that would be similar to Machine God, but without its ravenous hunger for sacrifice.\n\nOnce the Lesser Deity was unveiled, the Machine God\u2019s people were very displeased. Why, they wondered, did they sacrifice so much to try to create a potentially apocalyptic and cruel Machine God \u2014 who still doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 when benefits could easily be reaped with less sacrifice?\n\nAt the very least, today\u2019s sell-off in Big Tech could be described as a biblical reckoning. Beyond that, there\u2019s a lesson about the type of market and economic environment that creates these types of God-sized ambitions.\n\nNvidia is on track to set a record for the biggest single-day market cap loss in US history:\n\nFor readers who haven\u2019t guessed yet, the parable was meant to contrast the US\u2019s efforts to develop artificial intelligence \u2014 and its discussion of \u201cArtificial General Intelligence\u201d at whatever cost \u2014 with those of Chinese start-up DeepSeek.\n\nOne could argue that all of this could\u2019ve been avoided by simply not promoting the idea of a maximalist Machine God. But financial markets were yearning for salvation, and there were holes in the bullish narrative that could only be filled by Machine God itself.\n\nTake commercial property markets. The slump in office occupancy freaked out investors in office properties (and even bank bonds) and decimated downtowns. But the data-centre boom was a bright spot in the broader market, as plenty of analysts pointed out at the time.\n\nCorporate profits? Well, as our pals at Unhedged very sharply pointed out this month, the recipients of capex dollars get cash today, while the expenses are booked over time. That means that, in effect, a bunch of money is flying around today that doesn\u2019t take a bite out of megacap profits until later.\n\nAnd broadly, stocks have been pricey. Last Friday, before the DeepSeek market meltdown, the S&P 500 was trading at 28 times last year\u2019s earnings, according to FactSet, well above the long-term average of 18. The market has largely been driven by the biggest companies in the US (the Magnificent 7, as they\u2019ve been named). They are OpenAI sponsor Microsoft, chipmaker Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, and Tesla\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009all of which are major participants in the race to develop and monetise AI.\n\nMany of these companies have otherwise been under pressure from the burdens of corporate maturity, whether from regulations, rising costs, or slowing growth and whatnot.\n\nAmericans love when the stock market\u2019s line goes up, though.

Schneider Electric, a French maker\u00a0of electrical power products\u00a0that has invested heavily in services for data centres, fell 9.5 per cent.\n\nTraders sought shelter in perceived havens, with shares in consumer staples companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, General Mills and Hershey posting solid gains on Monday.\n\nApple, which is viewed as less exposed to the AI race than many Big Tech rivals, gained 3.3 per cent.\n\nTo some, the sell-off in the companies making the \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d of the AI revolution echoed the share-price crash of IT hardware company Cisco when the dotcom bubble burst.\n\nNvidia, Broadcom and other chipmakers have benefited from Silicon Valley\u2019s race to build ever-larger clusters of chips, which the likes of xAI boss Elon Musk and OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman have argued are needed to keep advancing AI\u2019s capabilities.\n\nNvidia\u2019s chief executive Jensen Huang and Broadcom\u2019s Hock Tan have argued in recent weeks that they expected the data centre building frenzy to continue until the end of the decade.\n\n\u201cIt shows how vulnerable the AI trade still is, like every trade that is consensus and based on the assumption of an unassailable lead,\u201d said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management.\n\nBut some Wall Street analysts and AI researchers have questioned the hype surrounding DeepSeek\u2019s achievement. \u201cIt seems categorically false that \u2018China duplicated OpenAI for $5M\u2019 and we don\u2019t think it really bears further discussion,\u201d wrote analysts at Bernstein in a note to clients.\n\nSome researchers have even speculated that DeepSeek was able to take shortcuts in its own training costs by leveraging the latest models from OpenAI, suggesting that while it has been able to replicate the latest US developments very quickly, it will be harder for the Chinese company to pull ahead.\n\nAI investment by large-cap US tech companies hit $224bn last year, according to UBS, which expects the total to reach $280bn in 2025. OpenAI and SoftBank announced last week a plan to invest $500bn over the next four years in AI infrastructure.\n\nEven following DeepSeek\u2019s latest release, Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg said on Friday that he planned to spend as much as $65bn on AI infrastructure this year.\n\nFounded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek last week released a detailed paper explaining how to build a large language model that could automatically learn and improve itself.\n\n\u201cIt seems as if there is a bit of reality dawning that China has not been sitting idle, even as these tariffs and investment restrictions on tech companies have been put in place,\u201d said Mitul Kotecha, Asia head of emerging markets macro and foreign exchange strategy at Barclays.\n\nThe US imposed stringent restrictions on chip exports to China under former President Joe Biden, banning the sale of Nvidia\u2019s most advanced models to the country.\n\nSome analysts argued that DeepSeek\u2019s advances would ultimately prove positive for AI chipmakers such as Nvidia.\n\nDylan Patel, chief analyst at chip consultancy SemiAnalysis, said cutting the costs of training and running AI models would over the longer term make it easier and cheaper for businesses and consumers to adopt AI applications.\n\n\u201cAdvancements in training and inference efficiency enable further scaling and proliferation of AI,\u201d said Patel. \u201cThis phenomenon has occurred in the semiconductor industry for decades, where Moore\u2019s Law drove a halving of cost every two years while the industry kept growing and adding more capabilities to chips.\u201d\n\nReporting by George Steer, Jennifer Hughes, Harriet Clarfelt and Will Schmitt in New York, Arjun Neil Alim in Hong Kong, Leo Lewis in Tokyo, Eleanor Olcott in Beijing and Tim Bradshaw and Ian Smith in London", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e670a4ea-05ad-4419-b72a-7727e8a6d471"}, {"uuid4": "d543eed9-b02c-41d5-9a24-91bc8816fc7c", "title": "Robert Kennedy allies fear he is losing US Senate support", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s pick to run health department has faced criticism over anti-vaccine stance", "author": "Myles McCormick", "published_date": "2025-01-27T21:12:39.887Z", "content": "Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s allies fear he has failed to convince enough senators to confirm him as President Donald Trump\u2019s top health official, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nKennedy, known as RFK Jr, was holding last-minute meetings with Democrats and Republicans ahead of two days of questioning by the Senate\u2019s finance and health committees later this week, three people said. He has met more than 60 senators since his nomination.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more anxiety now than ever,\u201d said a person close to Kennedy. \u201cThis is a big week: if the vote were today it would be iffy. We really need to solidify momentum this week to overcome all the negativity there\u2019s been.\u201d\n\nOpposition to Kennedy\u2019s nomination has emerged from influential conservative voices, including The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board and Americans Advancing Freedom, a group co-founded by former vice-president Mike Pence that has expressed concern about the former Democrat\u2019s support for abortion rights.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s weird with RFK is the sheer volume of maybes that we need to watch and see where they come down \u2014 he is undoubtedly one of the two most endangered nominees,\u201d said Chris Meekins, a Washington policy analyst for investment bank Raymond James.\n\nRepublican senators Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are considered obvious candidates to oppose Kennedy\u2019s nomination. All three voted against Trump\u2019s defence secretary nominee Pete Hegseth last week when he secured Senate confirmation with just a single tiebreaking vote cast by vice-president JD Vance.\n\nBut Kennedy\u2019s support for abortion rights and his push to shake up the food industry and biomedical research funding were also potential sources of Republican opposition, people in his camp acknowledged.\n\nAnti-abortion senators, including James Lankford; Republican senators, such as Todd Young and Thom Tillis, who are historically close to the pharmaceutical industry; and those with a large agricultural industry in their states, such as John Hoeven, were risks for Kennedy, the people said.\n\nA spokesperson for Young said the Indiana senator had a \u201cvery positive\u201d meeting with Kennedy in December. Representatives for the others did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cThese are the most consequential confirmation hearings for any [Health and Human Services] secretary we have probably seen in many decades,\u201d said Meekins.\n\nKennedy, a vocal vaccine sceptic and critic of the pharmaceutical industry, would control a sprawling department with 13 divisions and agencies and a budget of $1.8tn if he was confirmed.\n\nA representative for Kennedy said they had \u201cfull confidence\u201d that he would win the Senate vote.\n\nPrediction market Polymarket gives Kennedy an 80 per cent chance of being confirmed, compared with almost 100 per cent for nominees such as Scott Bessent, Trump\u2019s pick for Treasury secretary. Tulsi Gabbard, his nominee as intelligence director, was on just 51 per cent.\n\nKennedy has stirred controversy for his previous opposition to some childhood vaccines, MMR shots and the Covid-19 jab, although he has softened those positions to curry favour with senators.\n\nHe also earned $11.6mn from vaccine lawsuits over the past two years and has said he would keep a 10 per cent stake in any windfall from litigation against Merck\u2019s Gardasil vaccine. One of his closest advisers \u2014 lawyer Aaron Siri \u2014 also led a lawsuit trying to revoke the most widely used polio vaccine.\n\nMcConnell, a polio survivor, has taken issue with Kennedy\u2019s antivax comments, warning in December that undermining confidence in \u201cproven cures\u201d was \u201cdangerous\u201d. Representatives for McConnell and fellow rebels on the Hegseth vote, Murkowski and Collins, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nKennedy\u2019s vow to ban high-fructose corn syrup had also worried senators with states in the agricultural heartlands, the people close to him said.\n\nDemocratic senators, such as Sheldon Whitehouse and John Fetterman, have flirted with supporting Kennedy\u2019s nomination, potentially complicating the vote. Neither senator responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe weeklong delay to Kennedy\u2019s Senate hearings also pointed to some concerns that he did not have enough support, Washington insiders noted.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s all kumbaya, it\u2019s in your incentive to push ahead with the hearings.

From the flurry of executive orders to the raft of state-led lawsuits challenging them, it\u2019s predictably difficult to keep up with what the president is doing. But if you listen carefully, there is signal in the noise. Here are my three leading indicators about what to expect from Donald Trump\u2019s second administration based on his first week in office.\n\nCEOs are stepping over themselves to fall in line with Trump, not only because they like his tax cuts and deregulation agenda, but also because he\u2019s making it clear that he\u2019ll come after them personally if they don\u2019t. Before inauguration, when asked whether he thought Mark Zuckerberg had ditched independent fact-checking at Meta because of Trump\u2019s threats to put him in jail, he gloated, \u201cProbably.\u201d Let\u2019s think about that for a minute. We now have an American president who openly admits that he\u2019s using the power of his office to coerce business leaders. What\u2019s the difference between this and what provincial Chinese governors do when they shake down rich entrepreneurs for more tax money?\n\nTrump doubled down on the personal attacks in his remarks to the World Economic Forum in Davos last week when he told Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan onstage that he\u2019d better start doing more lending to conservatives, or else. In response, Moynihan took the sycophantic approach and tried to joke with Trump about their mutual CEO friends attending the forum. I don\u2019t know which is more horrible: the autocratic tendencies of this president, or the way in which the business community as a whole refuses to stand up to him. I can\u2019t help but think of German and Italian business men in the run-up to the second world war. I don\u2019t think history will remember any of these business leaders well.\n\nThe Davos speech was the usual mixture of bluster and policy points, but the president said almost nothing of substance about China. He was tough on Europe\u2019s value added tax and cumbersome regulations, and told Canada that \u201cwe don\u2019t need your lumber or your oil\u201d, but when it came to China, he made no threats and had no real policy prescriptions. Indeed, the one point of substance he raised, regarding talks with Russia and China about reducing nuclear arsenals, has not a chance of succeeding. Neither nation has expressed any interest in reducing nukes \u2014 why would they? There was also no mention of tariffs against China and no discussion of Taiwan (Trump isn\u2019t interested in a war in the South China Sea; indeed, he made it clear he wants to end the one in Ukraine ASAP). Couple all this with the capitulation on TikTok and signs that the US is open to trade talks with Beijing. Trump is showing us that all the tough talk about China was a PR show for his base. His main focus will be on building industrial capacity and keeping US stock markets high \u2014 not starting a trade war with Beijing.\n\nBefore the Trump administration, there was much fretting about the frothy tech market, which has been highly concentrated in a handful of Silicon Valley stocks. But tech bros are now running things in Washington; the picture of Zuck, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and others sitting with Trump\u2019s family at the inauguration is already iconic. In his Davos speech, Trump said he considered the EU\u2019s antitrust cases against Apple and Google to be a \u201cform of taxation\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009these are American companies and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that\u201d. Big Tech valuations are based in large part on monopoly power, and to the extent that the threat of any federal antitrust action or regulation of AI is now gone, I think these stocks are unlikely to correct anytime soon.\n\nPeter, what are your takeaways from Trump week one?\n\nRana, that\u2019s a pretty good list, though I think Trump could turn against both China and the tech industry very quickly. The president\u2019s gentler-than-expected approach to Beijing, I think, is driven by the transactional nature of everything he does \u2014 he thinks he can get a deal done to land TikTok with an American owner, launch a Chinese crackdown on the export of fentanyl precursors to avoid tariffs and convince Xi Jinping to pressure the Kremlin to sue for peace in Ukraine.\n\nThe problem is, China has shown no inclination to do any of these things (though it may be softening on allowing the sale of TikTok), and there are plenty of hardcore China hawks within the most senior reaches of the president\u2019s national security team, including Marco Rubio, the recently sworn-in secretary of state, and Michael Waltz, national security adviser. Rubio and Waltz (as well as Peter Navarro, who has joined the White House staff after a stint in prison for contempt of Congress) will be pressing Trump to reverse his dovish tone the minute any putative deal hits a roadblock.\n\nTrump\u2019s support for the tech industry is similarly fraught with conflicting factions. Right now, he\u2019s doing the bidding of the biggest of Big Tech names, several of which have cases not only before the European Commission but also the US competition authorities at the Federal Trade Commission and the justice department. But as the recent White House rollout of the so-called Stargate AI infrastructure project has demonstrated, the politics of Big Tech are complicated \u2014 especially with Elon Musk setting up an office within the White House bureaucracy. Musk immediately criticised the Stargate deal, arguing the companies behind the initiative (including OpenAI, which is in the middle of a legal battle with Musk) didn\u2019t have the promised funding on hand. I\u2019d expect more of that infighting to come, with Trump forced to take sides.\n\nThe one business sector you didn\u2019t mention is the oil and gas industry, which had some of the clearest wins in week one. Although Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord (again) got most of the attention, that was just one of about a half-dozen executive orders aimed at the energy sector. They opened new lands for fossil fuel exploration, cleared some hurdles for permitting and eased environmental regulations on oil and gas production.\n\nOur friend and former colleague Ed Crooks, now a top energy analyst at Wood Mackenzie, is sceptical whether any of these measures will have a medium-term impact on oil and gas output \u2014 those are driven by market prices and investor sentiment more than federal government policy, he argues \u2014 but it ticks a lot of boxes from the industry\u2019s wishlist. Perhaps that\u2019s not surprising, given that Trump has tapped industry friends for the most important energy-related jobs in his cabinet: for energy secretary, it\u2019s Chris Wright, who headed one of the US\u2019s largest fracking companies, and at interior it\u2019s billionaire Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, which along with Texas is the most fracking-friendly state in the US.\n\nWeek one was obviously not great for the entire energy sector, given there was a concomitant undermining of the renewables industry \u2014 in addition to withdrawing from Paris, there were restrictions on wind power development, unwinding incentives on electric vehicles and scrapping efficiency standards on household appliances. But if I were an executive at an oil and gas company right now, I\u2019d be pretty happy with how the first week went.", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c122bd9b-e933-417f-97c3-67d766610f9a"}, {"uuid4": "c298d0d1-f083-487e-9445-f5d6fb631f5d", "title": "DeepSeek sell-off shows the risks of a concentrated US stock market", "description": "Should investors turn to equally weighted index products?", "author": "Toby Nangle", "published_date": "2025-01-27T12:36:31.025Z", "content": "The writer is an FT contributing editor\n\nThe current sell-off in the tech sector triggered by the progress of Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek is a reminder of the risks of a concentrated stock market. The largest 10 stocks account for almost two-fifths of the S&P 500. Such concentration is unprecedented in modern times. Increasingly, equally weighted index products, which invest the same amount of money in every stock in a benchmark, are being touted as a way to dodge the risks of an ever more concentrated portfolio. Should investors heed these calls?\n\nMore concentrated stock markets make for less diversified passive portfolios. But this need not be a problem for either returns or even risk-adjusted returns. Having a third of your portfolio in a handful of stocks that compound high double-digit returns has been fabulous for passive investors in recent years, if less so for those active managers that underweighted Big Tech.\n\nAnd there are good reasons why the largest companies are so highly valued. Today\u2019s superstar corporates capture global economies of scale. They manufacture and control valuable intellectual property and have demonstrated the ability to commercialise it. Their earnings have been fast growing and persistently so. Market prices tell us that investors believe this trend can be sustained.\n\nBut the most valuable companies of today are rarely the most valuable ones 10 years hence. Research by Bridgewater Associates last year examined the performance of the most prized US businesses going back to 1900. By assembling a new cohort at the start of each decade and tracking their relative performances, the authors found that a market-weighted basket of the largest 10 stocks underperformed the market by an average 22 per cent over the next decade. Run the clock three decades forward and this underperformance extended to 53 per cent.\n\nSuch dynamism is healthy. Superstar tech companies of yesteryear such as Eastman Kodak, Xerox and Lucent have been supplanted by today\u2019s Apple, Amazon and Alphabet. Some combination of spirited competition on the part of the market and effective antitrust machinery is key to economic growth.\n\nIt is possible that today\u2019s megacaps will be more successful than their forebears in either reinventing and disrupting themselves to stave off challengers, or in stifling competition and capturing government. But to believe so is to believe that this time will be different. And for long-term investors pondering equal-weighted index products, this is the big call. Reversion to a less concentrated market requires underperformance on the part of the largest companies. It is this that would be likely to propel outperformance by equally weighted index trackers.\n\nNo one can know whether the megacap tech titans of today will sustain, or perhaps even grow, their market presence. A year ago, the elastic band seemed stretched. Since then, the so-called Magnificent Seven have delivered an average return of more than 60 per cent in 2024. There is certainly no foolproof quantitative model that will foretell the future. And so, like much of investing, it comes down to a judgment call.\n\nGoldman Sachs published its call in October. In its judgment, today\u2019s index concentration will unwind, and the impact this has on the long-term return estimates is profound. The bank\u2019s forecast team, led by David Kostin, estimates the S&P 500 will return only 3 per cent a year over the next 10 years. With no change in index concentration, their call would have been a return of 7 per cent a year. As such, their baseline expectation is for stocks to underperform US Treasuries \u2014 a historical rarity.\n\nOne of the attractions of passive investing on a market cap-weighted basis is that it offers a free ride on markets that have been made efficient through the analytical toils of active investors. Passive investors do not need to take a view on the prospects of any individual company. To invest in an equally weighted index fund, by contrast, is to implicitly reject the notion that the stock market is efficient.\n\nEqual-weight index products are a way to take exposure to American stocks without betting that this time will be different. They offer investors diversification, but run the risk of missing out if the Magnificent Seven continue their upward march. As the late Charlie Munger once observed, \u201cdiversification is for the know-nothing investor\u201d. His point was not that diversification was stupid, but rather that it diluted any insights that professional investors might have. Theory dictates that Munger\u2019s know-nothing investor would be best served by market cap-weighted index investing. For those wishing to capitalise on a view that today\u2019s extreme concentration will revert to mean, equally weighted index products may prove more attractive.", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/dc193d22-3221-4945-b0b1-430a12966d2f"}, {"uuid4": "0989dd64-ed80-4a6f-8cba-08b496ed8c21", "title": "A farcical Colombian chapter in Trump\u2019s trade war", "description": "A pointless spat over deportation flights shows the destructive futility ahead ", "author": "Alan Beattie", "published_date": "2025-01-27T12:31:44.829Z", "content": "Well, that made no sense at all. Believe what narrative you want: following an exchange of heated rhetoric and mutual threats of trade sanctions on social media yesterday, either Colombian President Gustavo Petro backed down from his refusal to allow military deportation flights or Donald Trump blinked and allowed said removals to proceed in a more humane manner. Given the relative sizes of their economies (an instant analysis by the Kiel Institute of Trump\u2019s threatened 25 per cent tariffs showed a distinctly non-negligible 0.4-0.6 per cent hit on annual Colombian GDP) it\u2019s quite likely Petro didn\u2019t think through the consequences of acting on his own. He might well have found the dollar-based financial system mightier than the pen of his anti-colonialist poetic defiance on, of all places, Elon Musk\u2019s X social media platform. On the other hand, US stock futures fell after Trump made his threats, which might merit some reflection for all those people who\u2019ve confidently been telling me that the president will never do anything to weaken share prices.\n\nIt\u2019s also entirely possible that both think they got a result. Petro got the confrontation he wanted rather than just doing the theatre of taking handcuffs off deportees without actually refusing them, as Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva did in Brazil. Trump no doubt thinks his willingness to reach for the heavy ordnance in terms of tariffs and financial sanctions worked, and will do so again. Is this the end of this particular chapter of the saga? What will happen to the threatened tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China to be imposed on Friday? By now you know my habitual quotation from screenwriter William Goldman (of whom I\u2019m genuinely thinking of carrying around a cardboard cut-out): nobody knows anything.\n\nDespite said mantra I did ask you all to guess what Trump would do first on taking office, and I report back on that below. Today\u2019s main piece is on how tax and trade wars combine to create a whole new conflict. Responding to reader demand, I also look at Trump\u2019s plan for an External Revenue Service. Charted Waters is on Bitcoin. Any thoughts on anything: alan.beattie@ft.com.\n\nIt seems like we weren\u2019t looking at a wide enough field of fire when trying to anticipate the opening salvos. The surprise on the first day of Trump\u2019s presidency was the threat to impose punitive taxes on foreign corporations and nationals in the US in retaliation for what he describes as unfair taxes abroad, as well as the somewhat more predictable decision to pull out the OECD agreement on minimum corporate tax.\n\nThe mechanism Trump chose, a little-known 90-year-old provision of the tax code, was unexpected. But the US moaning about foreigners imposing unfair taxes on US companies abroad has a strong recent history. In the past it has spilled into trade disputes and may now do so again, depending on if and how Trump conducts his assault.\n\nGiven the number of tech bros swarming over his administration, it\u2019s not surprising Trump is repeating his first-term offensive on the digital services taxes (DSTs) that several European countries have introduced. But since before his first election in 2016 he\u2019s also been moaning about countries with a value added tax. Export rebates on VAT, so the argument goes, act like tariffs by charging US exporters entering a foreign market while foreign companies aren\u2019t charged in the US, which doesn\u2019t have VAT.\n\nFew economists buy this argument, but Trump\u2019s VAT obsession taps into a rich and venerable vein of grievance on the subject among certain Washington trade lawyers.\n\nThe US introduced a tax provision, the Foreign Sales Corporation, in the 1980s to correct for the alleged VAT disadvantage. The EU brought WTO cases against it and an associated measure starting in 1997. After nearly a decade of prolonged litigation and complaints about compliance, Brussels won.\n\nThere was lots of grumpiness on Capitol Hill about the US\u2019s sovereign right to tax, similar to the interminable \u201czeroing\u201d dispute over WTO rulings against US antidumping methodology. And thus was added another eye of newt to the simmering Washington cauldron of resentment about WTO dispute settlement that caused the US progressively to detach from it.\n\nOK, so. What\u2019s Trump going to do about it and what can the EU (the main likely target, certainly for digital taxes) do to defend or counterattack? If Trump uses trade or investment restrictions to punish the EU for its DSTs, the EU\u2019s choice is clear and things could get spicy very quickly. As keen readers will know, the EU created an \u201canti-coercion instrument\u201d (ACI) precisely because of Trump\u2019s previous threats on DSTs. The ACI gives the EU wide leeway to retaliate against foreign governments that use trade tools to attempt to force the EU or its governments to change policy \u2014 in this case to kill the DSTs.\n\nThe ACI has now been on the books since 2023 and hasn\u2019t been used. What better casus belli than the original provocation come back again? The only thing is making sure enough member states are on board, since they gave themselves a big say over deploying the ACI, and Trump will no doubt try to bully or bribe them out of it.\n\nOn the other hand, if Trump sticks to using purely tax tools to punish the EU for DSTs, they might find it harder to respond. Power over tax still mainly resides with EU member states, not centrally. The ACI is supposed to be used against trade and investment actions only. If Trump manages to discipline himself to meeting DSTs (and maybe VATs) with tax retribution, he might put the EU in a difficult spot, unable to retaliate collectively. Then again, precision and self-discipline, as Gustavo Petro could now tell you, aren\u2019t exactly the traits for which Trump is famous.\n\nAnother weird out-of-the blue plan of Trump\u2019s is to start collecting tariff revenue through a new External Revenue Service, part of his insistence that foreign exporters pay the taxes on imports to the US. At least one reader has asked me if this means anything, so as a service I had a think. More usefully, I also went to one of the world\u2019s great repositories of customs-related knowledge, Anna Jerzewska, founder of the consultancy Trade and Borders.\n\nThe verdict: \u201cno\u201d. I\u2019m sure many of you know this already, but companies sending goods across borders generally hire a registered customs broker to do all the formalities including paying duties. For smaller consignments this might be a carrier like FedEx, for larger ones more likely a specialist company or a service offered by the big cargo carriers such as Maersk. The importing company involved typically pays the broker who transfers the money to the customs authorities, in the US\u2019s case Customs and Border Protection.\n\nUnless Trump is going to try some impossible scheme such as charging a foreign exporter tax in its home country before the goods are shipped, the system can\u2019t really be changed. Jerzewska says: \u201cIt\u2019s very unclear what any External Revenue Service will do, but what it won\u2019t do is collect tariffs in a radically different way. Tariffs are charged to importers, and that will continue.\u201d And that, as far as I am concerned, is that.\n\nHopefully someone can make Trump happy with a plan to do something for show. He could carve out some part of CBP and called it the External Revenue Service if he wants, perhaps fitting its officers out in snazzy outfits featuring a silver belt buckle in the shape of a dollar sign. After all, the Italian Guardia di Finanza, a militarised tax police force who collect customs duties among their other tasks, wear intimidating grey uniforms complete with ceremonial swords and zip around in impressively heavy-duty patrol boats. Collecting taxes in Italy isn\u2019t traditionally a task for the faint-hearted. Someone get Trump a brochure.\n\nNone of this posturing will make any difference, of course, to the question of who actually bears the cost of import taxes. A rise in tariffs could be absorbed by the foreign exporter who reduces their prices to keep the post-tax import price the same, or by a company inside the US economy taking the hit from the higher price of imported inputs on its margins. Or it could be passed along to the eventual end-user. The evidence from the first Trump administration is that it was some combination of the second and third. Relabelling existing collection mechanisms won\u2019t change this.\n\nI asked you a few weeks back what Trump\u2019s first trade action would be as president. \u201cRepeal the offshore drilling ban, even if he has to break the law\u201d was spot on \u2014 Trump issued an executive order to that effect on the first day \u2014 assuming we count that as a trade action. \u201cDeclare a national economic emergency\u201d was the most innovative suggestion. Not quite yet, but I guess if he follows through with tariffs on someone like Colombia using the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA), that will be fulfilled. Obviously putting tariffs on Mexico and Canada was another popular guess. But in the latter case we\u2019re going to have to wait until the February 1 deadline to see if that happens.\n\nHaving a cryptocurrency fan in the White House is, it seems, good for Bitcoin\u2019s business.\n\nThe FT does a big overview on Trump\u2019s waging of global economic warfare.\n\nThe EU is contemplating introducing \u201cBuy Europe\u201d domestic procurement rules. This would be a victory for France, which has pushed the idea for decades.\n\nMy FT colleague Martin Sandbu says the EU should grasp the trading and economic opportunities that Trump\u2019s policies are opening up.\n\nSam Lowe of the Most-Favoured Nation newsletter heroically does his best to explain that the regional \u201cPEM\u201d convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin, which the UK may or may not take up the EU\u2019s offer to join, isn\u2019t a customs union. Also, for those keeping up with the twists and turns of UK policy, the government is apparently now not in favour of a full trade deal with the US after all.\n\nIf your idea of fun is a trivia competition with other economics and finance nerds \u2014 and let\u2019s face it, if it isn\u2019t I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re doing here \u2014 then the FT\u2019s Alphaville is holding the inaugural Washington leg of its legendary pub quiz on February 6.

A European executive, sharing the World Economic Forum shuttle bus with me, buried her head in her hands and lamented: \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d\n\nBut the response of delegates from the Middle East, Asia and Africa was very different. Many people from the global south (to use the annoying shorthand) think Trump is good news for them. Recent polling shows that, in countries such as India, Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil, this pro-Trump attitude extends well beyond the Davos-going elites.\n\nThe US president is widely seen, outside the west, as transactional, pro-business and a peacemaker. What\u2019s not to like?\n\nPlenty, actually. Look beyond the hype and there are many reasons for the global south to be deeply concerned about Trump\u2019s America.\n\nThe US president is essentially pushing for an abandonment of the \u201crules-based international order\u201d that has provided the stability and open markets that allowed China, India and a large part of south-east Asia to become much richer over the last 30 years.\n\nRipping up those rules and moving to a completely transactional world may sound refreshingly straightforward. But a world without rules is one in which the strong prey upon the weak \u2014 without any framework of law or principle to constrain them. And most of the countries of the global south are more likely to end up as prey than predator.\n\nPanama, Colombia and Mexico are among the first nations to discover how uncomfortable a Trumpian world can be. Some 80 per cent of Mexico\u2019s exports go to the US. If Trump goes ahead with his threatened tariffs, he could push America\u2019s southern neighbour into an economic depression.\n\nMexico, of course, is not alone. Trump has threatened most major trading nations in the world with tariffs. The notion that this does not really matter because the president is \u201ctransactional\u201d \u2014 and that all his threats are simply preludes to a deal \u2014 ignores the way that business operates. International companies need stability and predictable legal regimes if they are to have the confidence to make long-term cross-border investments.\n\nThe evidence is that even when Trump makes a deal, there is no guarantee he will stick to it. During his first term, the US negotiated a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico \u2014 known as the USMCA. But Trump is now demanding fresh concessions.\n\nIf all agreements can be ripped up, in response to some new grievance or to take advantage of a shift in the balance of power, then no trade deal is secure. As one former central banker put it to me in Davos: \u201cThe logic of that is that you end up only being safe trading inside your own borders.\u201d\n\nWesterners may be shocked to see a US president talk like a mafia boss who wants more protection money. But many in the global south have always believed that American leaders act like mobsters \u2014 even if they talk like missionaries. At least, they say, Trump has now dropped the infuriating moralising. The hope is that a less hypocritical US will be easier to deal with, because it will not make unrealistic demands based on irrelevant western values.\n\nBut we are beginning to see what a US that proudly proclaims it has no altruistic interest in the outside world looks like \u2014 and it is not pretty. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, has announced a suspension of almost all US aid programmes. Only those that directly benefit Americans will be renewed. That could end programmes such as Pepfar, which provides drugs to combat HIV and Aids and has saved millions of lives around the world.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has casually appeared to endorse ethnic cleansing in Gaza. That could be terrible news for the Palestinians who would lose their homeland \u2014 and will also deeply alarm Jordan and Egypt, which are meant to take in the new refugees.\n\nThe US will certainly not be volunteering to resettle anybody. The poem carved on the Statue of Liberty proclaims: \u201cGive me your tired, your poor\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\u201d But, to put it mildly, that is not the mood of Trump\u2019s America, where the president\u2019s supporters wave banners demanding \u201cmass deportation now\u201d. Programmes to resettle refugees in the US have already been suspended.\n\nCutting down on legal immigration from places that Trump once described as \u201cshithole countries\u201d might also sound like good policy to many Americans. But it does not sound like good news for the middle classes of the global south, who may find that prized visas for skilled immigrants or students are much harder to come by.\n\nStill, perhaps all the concerns about trade, aid and migration can be waved away if Trump makes good on his promise to end wars around the world. However, the president\u2019s aspiration to be a global peacemaker is difficult to reconcile with his proclaimed ambition to expand US territory.\n\nIf there is one idea that the countries of the global south all claim to repudiate, it is imperialism. If Trump turns out to be both serious and literal about his plans to expand America\u2019s borders, their applause for him may quickly fade away.\n\ngideon.rachman@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/51e4c1a6-ef17-4e14-bea3-645e611008a3"}, {"uuid4": "967dcc37-339b-420c-acc6-a27ee193badb", "title": "Donald Trump sparks race for trade deals to counter US tariffs", "description": "Nations turn to tactic used in US president\u2019s first term when more bilateral agreements were signed  ", "author": "Janina Conboye", "published_date": "2025-01-27T11:00:44.757Z", "content": "The US\u2019s economic partners are racing to sustain trade volumes in a Donald Trump era by closing new bilateral deals and rerouting supply chains to cope with increased US protectionism.\n\nPolicymakers and trade experts say countries are turning to a tactic deployed during the US president\u2019s first term in office, when they signed more trade deals with one another as the world\u2019s biggest consumer economy erected barriers.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s election in November, the EU has clinched a long-awaited trade deal with the Mercosur bloc of South American countries, updated a free trade agreement with Mexico, and reopened negotiations with Malaysia that were moribund for more than a decade.\n\nTrump meanwhile in his first days in office threatened tariffs of up to 100 per cent on China, 25 per cent on Canada and Mexico, and said he was considering a blanket levy on all US imports. He also ordered US government agencies to probe trade issues including currency manipulation and counterfeit goods.\n\nTengku Zafrul Aziz, Malaysia\u2019s trade minister, told the Financial Times the return of Trump \u201ccould indeed prompt countries to further diversify their trade portfolios\u201d.\n\nAziz cited the example of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which went ahead with 11 members in 2018 after Trump pulled the US out of talks. The deal \u201cdemonstrated the resilience of countries willing to co-operate even in the absence of traditional economic leaders like the US,\u201d he said.\n\nEU trade commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told the World Economic Forum in Davos that his diary was full of meetings with ministers from the Gulf countries and elsewhere. \u201cThere is huge interest\u201d in doing deals with the EU, he said.\n\nThe entire team of commissioners will visit India to make progress on trade negotiations and technology partnerships in the next few months.\n\n\u201cThe countries actively doing deals do so independently of the situation of the US,\u201d said one European official, adding there was a \u201chuge gap\u201d between the rhetoric of what Washington would like to do and what really happens on the ground.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s first term the EU signed deals with Japan \u2014 a staunch US ally that feared economic damage from his policies \u2014 Singapore and Vietnam and started talks with New Zealand and Chile, ultimately completing the agreements. One EU official joked the president was \u201cthe best EU trade commissioner ever\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of deals,\u201d said Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the EU trade commissioner when Trump was last in power who was instrumental in earlier negotiations in Mercosur. \u201cWe thought, it\u2019s a rough world. We don\u2019t believe in trade wars. We have an unpredictable president who throws tariffs around all over the place. Let\u2019s see what we can do together.\u201d\n\nMalmstr\u00f6m, now with the law firm Covington & Burling, expects a deal with Mexico and talks with Australia, Indonesia and possibly the Philippines and Thailand to be concluded during Trump\u2019s four-year term.\n\nBernd Lange, who chairs the European parliament\u2019s trade committee, said the EU\u2019s response to Trump would couple retaliatory tariffs with deeper trade relationships elsewhere. \u201cApart from defending ourselves, we should further strengthen our partnership with third countries like the UK, Mexico, Japan or Canada, who might also be in the crossfire.\n\n\u201cThis means ratifying trade agreements like EU-Mercosur, and concluding negotiations with partners like Australia and Indonesia.\u201d\n\nIn 2020 Asean countries plus China, Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand formed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. RCEP mainly reduced non-tariff barriers to trade such as veterinary controls and customs procedures. RCEP covers 2.3bn people and 30 per cent of global GDP, compared with 25 per cent by the US.\n\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area, which will scrap 90 per cent of tariffs over time, started in 2021.\n\nGoods and services trade has continued to grow in recent years despite the Covid-19 pandemic and rising protectionism.\n\nScott Lincicome at the Cato Institute, a Washington-based think-tank, said: \u201cRegardless of what Donald Trump does over the next few years, everyone else appears unwilling to embrace costly economic isolationism and will instead just move on without us. There are about 370 trade deals in force as of mid-2024 with no sign of a forthcoming reversal.\u201d\n\nChina, meanwhile, has recently clinched deals with Serbia, Cambodia, Nicaragua and Ecuador. Beijing, which Trump sees as the US\u2019s greatest rival, accounts for about 30 per cent of global manufacturing.\n\nOne senior trade official, who declined to be named, said they were \u201cmore sceptical this time round\u201d of a flurry of dealmaking because the agreements left to complete were tougher to negotiate.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s return might promote new bilaterals, perhaps in Africa.

The US EV maker has already made more than $2bn in the first nine months of last year from selling credits into emission pooling systems globally. In another pool, Mercedes-Benz has teamed up with Polestar and Volvo \u2014 both owned by China\u2019s Geely.\n\nGeely\u2019s founder Li Shufu holds about 10 per cent of Mercedes, while Beijing owned BAIC holds another 10 per cent.\n\nMercedes said it continued to \u201cinvest billions into electric vehicles\u201d. \u201cHowever, the pace of the transformation of our industry is determined by market conditions and our customers,\u201d it added.\n\nVW and Renault, which analysts say look likely to struggle to meet targets through their own sales, have few pooling alternatives other than Chinese manufacturers MG-SAIC and BYD.\u00a0Renault could potentially also pool with strategic partners Nissan and Mitsubishi.\n\nPooling is controversial. Some executives warn that the arrangement will make the European industry less competitive by empowering rivals in China at a time when Brussels has imposed higher tariffs on Chinese EVs to protect the continent\u2019s carmakers.\n\nJens Gieseke, a centre-right lawmaker in the European parliament, said the EU had made a \u201cmistake\u201d in allowing pooling with US and Chinese carmakers as this could benefit European carmakers\u2019 rivals.\n\nIndustry players are reluctant to put numbers on expected payments publicly, as carmakers trade credits behind closed doors in groupings based on a web of alliances linked to their equity stakes and brand tie-ups.\n\nThe German state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 per cent stake in VW while Renault is 15 per cent government owned, making the groups\u2019 pooling with Chinese carmakers a politically sensitive topic, according to UBS analyst Patrick Hummel.\n\nHe added that if VW chose to pool, it would probably need to do so with a number of Chinese companies, as BYD might not have enough EV sales in Europe to fill the German group\u2019s gap alone.\n\nThe German group would need to almost double its EV sales in just one year if it were to meet EU targets itself, according to UBS. The company does not have a new mass-model EV launch planned in 2025. Renault is hoping to boost its EV sales with the launch of a \u20ac25,000 model.\n\nVW said it would aim to avoid the penalties through \u201cits own efforts\u201d, pointing to a series of fully-electric models that were launched last year.\n\n\u201cOnly in a second step would other measures such as pooling come into play, naturally weighing up costs and benefits,\u201d the company said. \u201cEvery euro invested in possible penalties would be a poorly invested euro.\u201d\n\nRenault has said that it was too early to decide on pooling, but added the arrangements with Chinese manufacturers risked weakening the European car industry further.\n\nBrussels is under pressure from the sector to make emissions rules more flexible as sales of electric vehicles in Germany and France fell last year after governments pulled back purchase subsidies for EVs.\n\nThe bloc\u2019s climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra met car industry representatives on Wednesday and a \u201cstrategic dialogue\u201d between officials and the sector is due to start this month.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ian Johnston and Patricia Nilsson", "tag": "china?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/677190d1-7d34-4506-a037-418baab67237"}, {"uuid4": "89ff3a44-1fe3-4a28-976e-4b13e9b32793", "title": "Is TikTok pushing Taiwan\u2019s young people closer to China?", "description": "A growing number of researchers fear that the controversial app is promoting pro-China content and softening attitudes towards the People\u2019s Republic", "author": "Kathrin Hille", "published_date": "2025-01-17T05:00:08.602Z", "content": "Last spring, pupils at National Chia-Yi Girls\u2019 Senior High School in southern Taiwan were set an unusual topic for their annual essay exam: \u201cHow to negotiate with a dictator\u201d.\n\nThe students had to choose the best survival strategy for a small country facing a powerful neighbour \u2014 prevent war at all costs, or deter through strength? The exam paper mentioned Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine, but the unspoken parallels with China\u2019s threat to their own country were obvious.\n\nTeachers say they were stunned when they got the scripts back: nearly all the teenagers argued that Taiwan must do everything to avoid provoking China into attacking it. \u201cAlmost without exception, they wrote that, being small and weak, Taiwan must avoid appearing as a threat to China,\u201d says Chu Yi-chun, who teaches Mandarin. \u201cNo matter how they harass us, we must tolerate it.\u201d\n\nSuch submissive sentiments are in sharp contrast to those held in Taiwan\u2019s society at large \u2014\u00a0and young people have traditionally been among the most passionately patriotic and pro-independence citizens in the country.\n\nAccording to data published by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation polling organisation last year, people between 20 and 24 are no longer the age group who feel their Taiwanese identity the strongest, bucking a long-established pattern.\u00a0And there are indications that, among young people, Taiwan\u2019s decades-old trend towards ever stronger support for independence might also be going into reverse.\n\nThere are many potential reasons for these changes. But for a number of Taiwanese social scientists and ruling party politicians, one of the main causes is TikTok, the controversial Chinese social media app that has amassed more than 1bn monthly active users worldwide.\n\nThe app \u201ccannot necessarily make Taiwanese youth identify with the Chinese nation or agree to unification with China\u201d, says Eric Hsu, a researcher at the Taiwanese think-tank Doublethink Lab who is working on the first systematic survey of TikTok\u2019s impact on Taiwanese society. \u201cBut it can probably lower their apprehension towards China and their will to resist.\u201d\n\nIn the US, TikTok is fighting for its survival after a law was passed last year requiring its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, either to sell its stake in the app or face a ban. The deadline is this coming Sunday.\n\nOfficials in Washington have said the platform poses a national security risk because China might coerce TikTok to manipulate information published every day to millions of people in the US through control of the platform\u2019s algorithm. They have also argued that the app allows Beijing to \u201cweaponise America\u2019s data against us\u201d \u2014 allegations that ByteDance has insistently and repeatedly denied.\n\nOfficials and researchers in other countries, especially western ones, have raised many concerns about the app, ranging from its addictive effects on children to the ways in which it could be used to sow disinformation.\n\nBut nowhere is the question of whether TikTok is a tool of Chinese political influence as vital as in Taiwan. Beijing claims the island, home to some 23mn people and the world\u2019s largest producer of advanced semiconductors, as part of its territory and misses no opportunity to reiterate its determination to bring it under control \u2014 a scenario that the vast majority of Taiwanese people vigorously reject. Ever since the country democratised in the 1990s, its identity separate from China and the determination to preserve its independence has grown more deep-rooted.\n\nTaiwanese educators and researchers fear that the ever greater numbers of children using the app risk being exposed to content that seems innocent, but causes them to look more favourably upon the People\u2019s Republic and feel more negative towards their own nation \u2014 something they suspect is a deliberate strategy by Beijing.\n\n\u201cTikTok remains committed to complying with local laws and regulations,\u201d a company spokesperson says in a statement.\n\nThe country\u2019s high school and university students, the first generation of TikTok users, are less politically engaged than earlier generations, says Lin Thung-hong, a research fellow at the institute of sociology at Taiwan\u2019s top research institution Academia Sinica. \u201cOver the past few years, young adults are much less willing to vote,\u201d he says. \u201cWe worry that they might turn cold on politics and retreat, and that would have an immense impact on Taiwan\u2019s political future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are not prepared to fight against China,\u201d says Chu, the teacher. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel that we must protect this land.\u201d\n\nAt first glance, TikTok seems an unlikely threat. According to the 2024 Taiwan Internet Report, an annual independent survey, just under 22 per cent of the population use the app, either in its international form, branded as TikTok, or the original version available in China, called Douyin.\n\nThat is the second-lowest proportion in Asia after Japan and little more than a quarter of the percentage in Malaysia, where TikTok has a dominant position. It is also markedly lower than in western countries like the US, Spain, France or the UK.\n\nBut, among young people, the picture changes radically. According to the government-backed Taiwan Communication Survey, 44 per cent of primary school pupils in Taiwan use TikTok, and among junior high school students (typically aged 13-15) usage is close to 60 per cent. The figure levels off only slightly among senior high school students.\n\nWhile a majority of Taiwanese TikTok users are male, among schoolchildren girls are massively heavier users. For many of them, dance is the way in. Yi-an, a 14-year-old from Shih-ting near Taipei, started watching self-recorded dance videos on the platform about two years ago.\n\n\u201cMy friends and I all really like these, and at some point I started making my own,\u201d she says. Yi-an now posts short dance routines every few days and is building a following of her own.\n\n\u201cIt becomes a key avenue through which they can express themselves and also\u00a0the main channel through which they build their social lives,\u201d says Chu.\n\nBoth TikTok and Douyin offer content in Mandarin, the national language of both Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China. TV dramas, songs, dance styles and celebrities from China, whose population dwarfs that of Taiwan, have a heavy presence.\n\n\u201cEven if they consume American, Japanese, Korean or whatever else on TikTok, they absorb Chinese content most easily,\u201d says Chu. \u201cThey include Chinese cultural references and lingo from that content in their speech and writing.\u201d\n\nInitial work done by the Doublethink study suggests this seemingly innocuous content can act as a gateway to less anodyne material. Researchers who set up TikTok accounts imitating Taiwanese schoolgirls discovered that, after a few days of them being served dance video clips, the app\u2019s algorithm started to suggest soft political content. Some were street interviews conducted in Taipei\u2019s trendy Ximending district in which Taiwanese teenagers were prompted to compare Chinese \u201cdemocracy\u201d with the weaknesses of their own political system.\n\nA study conducted by Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman in Malaysia spotted a similar pattern on RedNote, also known as Xiaohongshu, another rapidly spreading Chinese social media app, on which users test and recommend make-up, restaurants and travel destinations or teach cooking and other skills.\u00a0Xiaohongshu did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe findings also echo international research on TikTok. A series of studies conducted last year and led by Lee Jussim, a social psychologist at Rutgers University in the US, found that, when compared to other platforms such as Instagram or YouTube, TikTok offered a \u201cdisproportionately high ratio\u201d of content favourable to China\u2019s Communist party. Their results indicated that people who used TikTok heavily viewed China\u2019s human rights record in a significantly better light and felt more positive about visiting China.\n\nAs in many countries, observers worry that, because of the way the algorithm works, TikTok users increasingly inhabit echo chambers \u2014 but in Taiwan this has an added political charge. \u201cAmong our students, TikTok has the effect that everyone retreats into their bubble and is increasingly unable and unwilling to hear what others think,\u201d says Chu.\n\nIt may influence teenage behaviour in other ways. Smaller-scale studies have found that many Chinese slang words have entered Taiwan\u2019s youth lexicon in the past three years. The northern Chinese term \u201cniu\u201d (meaning \u201cawesome\u201d) was unheard of in Taiwan until recently, but now appears commonly on teenagers\u2019 social media feeds and in real life. Other Chinese-influenced memes and games have become commonplace, teachers say.\n\nCashbox, one of Taiwan\u2019s largest chains of Karaoke lounges, now offers a large and growing \u201cTikTok songs\u201d category. Kemusan, a twist-like dance set to an electronic version of a traditional Chinese tune that went viral on TikTok last year, triggered a huge craze in Taiwan.\n\nAll this seems a long way from politics, but seemingly harmless content can have political undertones, say researchers. \u201cThere are a lot of people selling agricultural products on Douyin who display their lifestyle of honest, hard work,\u201d says Hsu, adding that young Taiwanese people \u201cthink when they see this that, while the Chinese government may not be good, the Chinese people are simple and kind, so I don\u2019t need to feel animosity [towards Beijing].\u201d\n\nTeenagers the FT spoke to acknowledge that the app has an effect on them, but dismiss any suggestion that they are being influenced politically. Several admit that, after using TikTok, they had trouble concentrating and finishing longer assignments. \u201cI know I spend too much time on there, it kind of sucks you in,\u201d says Yi-an with a laugh.\n\nBut she and several friends said it was \u201cnonsense\u201d that they might become more China-friendly.\n\nFor Taiwan, building a sense of national pride took years after the end of one-party rule by the Kuomintang (KMT) in 1991, which had suppressed Taiwanese culture and study of the island\u2019s distinct history.\n\nBut that identification eventually became strong, especially among young Taiwanese. According to the Taiwan Social Change Survey, a multiyear research project run by Academia Sinica, the youngest age cohort consistently had the highest percentage of people identifying as \u201cTaiwanese only\u201d, as opposed to Chinese or both Taiwanese and Chinese: over 80 per cent.\n\nUntil a few years ago, Taiwanese youth frequently described themselves as \u201cnaturally pro-independence\u201d. In 2014, during the so-called Sunflower Movement, tens of thousands of students occupied parliament to protest against what they saw as the then-government\u2019s cosy relationship with China. The pro-independence Democratic Progressive party came to power two years later.\n\nBut Taiwan\u2019s political make-up has become more complex recently. Although last year\u2019s elections kept the DPP in power, the opposition took control of parliament, creating political deadlock. Some worry that this makes Taiwan especially susceptible to political polarisation.\n\nA 2022 survey conducted by Austin Wang at the University of Nevada suggested that TikTok had no marked influence on supporters of the DPP or the KMT opposition, which supports closer ties with China. But among people who supported the smaller Taiwan People\u2019s party, which benefited from younger swing voters\u2019 distaste for traditional partisan politics, \u201cwhether or not they use Douyin has a significant impact on political attitudes\u201d, Wang wrote.\n\nThe research suggested that opposition to Taiwanese independence was sharply higher among TikTok-using TPP supporters and neutral voters compared with non-TikTok users of the same group.\n\nSigns of growing Chinese influence are all the more noteworthy given that Taiwan\u2019s real-world exchanges with China are shrinking as relations between the two countries have become increasingly hostile.\n\nIn contrast to the 1990s and 2000s, when Taiwanese companies set up tens of thousands of factories in China, investment has been falling for over a decade. Meanwhile, tourism and student exchanges have slowed to a trickle, and the number of Taiwanese people living and working in China has fallen from a peak of over 400,000 a decade ago to half that.\n\nLin of Academia Sinica believes that TikTok and other platforms have filled the information vacuum. \u201cAs so many ties are cut, China tries to reach our young people through social media. That leads our youngsters who have never been in China and know nothing about it [to] develop illusions about it, and then they project the dissatisfactions they have with Taiwan on to that illusionary China.\u201d\n\nThe generational divide has been emphasised because many younger Taiwanese people feel at an economic and social disadvantage. During the 2010s, entry-level salaries were stagnant, while house prices have soared, partly as a result of Taiwan\u2019s extended technology export boom. Meanwhile, the country has one of the world\u2019s most rapidly ageing populations, threatening public healthcare and pensions. Younger people are also frustrated with what they see as unsustainable environmental and energy policies.\n\nThese misgivings have already led to disaffection with the two main parties, which they feel have failed to address their concerns, say pollsters.\n\nGovernment officials and experts fret that TikTok is exploiting these cleavages. \u201cWe still know very little,\u201d says Lin, \u201cbut what we can say for sure is that among Taiwanese users, TikTok heightens feelings of economic dissatisfaction, intensifies tendencies towards depression and undermines people\u2019s confidence that they can participate and make a difference politically.\u201d\n\nEnoch Wu, an activist affiliated with the DPP, suggests a simple solution, popular in party circles, echoing the approach taken in the US: the Taiwanese government should ban the app as a national security threat.\n\nEducators and parents interviewed for this story who are critical of the ruling party supported that view, but opposition politicians have argued that the government must not interfere with free speech.\n\nIn theory, Taiwan has a case. TikTok has not set up a subsidiary in the country but operates only through external marketing companies, an arrangement DPP officials say violates laws requiring media organisations to create a legal entity in Taiwan if they operate there.\n\nAccording to lawyers, Taipei could demand internet service providers and other business counterparts stop working with it. \u201cBut it is just impossible politically,\u201d says Puma Shen, a DPP lawmaker and expert in disinformation. \u201cThe very moment a DPP government [moved] on this, we\u2019d have the opposition at our throat accusing us of restricting free speech.\u201d\n\nThis debate matters, of course, far beyond Taiwan\u2019s borders. Officials in Taipei question how Washington will actually enforce a ban on TikTok: even if it is blocked or taken off app stores, determined users could easily get access via a VPN. They point to India, where TikTok user numbers have actually increased after the government banned it in June 2020.\n\nOne of the few levers for governments could be barring server companies from working with TikTok, thus denying it the bandwidth needed for smooth livestreaming and video loading, says Shen.\n\nHow Taiwan tackles these dilemmas will be a valuable case study for many other countries. Above and beyond a single app, there are existential questions at stake, insists Hsu. \u201cWe need to find an effective way of communicating with our young people,\u201d he says, arguing that banning TikTok would \u201conly shatter their trust in our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce our society is divided and our democratic system no longer trusted, Taiwan will lose its ability to resist China.\u201d", "tag": "china?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e25ee12b-3a4a-4a15-bd5e-0f5fb410e856"}, {"uuid4": "c2c85c21-cbd3-4421-9cad-dc26f266a11e", "title": "Trump\u2019s \u2018energy tsar\u2019 says US will lose \u2018AI arms race\u2019 without fossil fuels", "description": "Doug Burgum claims American reliance on renewable energy will hinder national security and boost China ", "author": "Amanda Chu", "published_date": "2025-01-16T18:37:13.005Z", "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of the interior has warned the US will lose the \u201cAI arms race\u201d to China unless it boosts electricity generation from fossil fuels and stabilises its power grid.\n\nDoug Burgum, a billionaire businessman and former governor of North Dakota, told US senators on Thursday that the country had an \u201celectricity crisis\u201d due to weaknesses in the grid and \u201croadblocks\u201d stopping companies from building fossil fuel plants that can supply round-the-clock power.\n\nHe added that the Trump administration would allocate more public land to drilling for oil and slash tax breaks favouring renewables companies that produce \u201cintermittent and unreliable power\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe sun doesn\u2019t always shine and the wind doesn\u2019t always blow,\u201d Burgum said in his senate confirmation hearing, adding that the balance was \u201cout of whack\u201d.\n\nDemand for electricity is growing at unprecedented rates in the US, driven by soaring demand from data centres for artificial intelligence processing \u2014 which the Department of Energy predicts will triple in the next three years.\n\n\u201cWithout baseload, we\u2019re going to lose the AI arms race to China, and if we lose the AI arms race to China, then that\u2019s got direct impacts on our national security,\u201d Burgum said.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019ve stacked a deck, where we are creating roadblocks for people who want to do baseload [electricity], and we\u2019ve got massive tax incentives for people who want to do intermittent and unreliable.\u201d\n\nBurgum, who endorsed Trump after ending his own 2024 presidential bid, is also tipped to lead the National Energy Council.

People familiar with the matter said Chinese financial authorities had launched an audit of Gao following the remarks.\n\nMany foreign economists also question the official figures. Analysts at US think-tank Rhodium Group said in a research note that growth last year was probably about half the official target, or 2.4-2.8 per cent.\n\nThe collapse of China\u2019s property sector had \u201csidelined\u201d local government investment and consumption \u2014 two important economic engines \u2014 in 2024, leading Beijing to announce a series of urgent stimulus measures, they said.\n\nChina\u2019s official data probably exaggerated household and government consumption, as well as gross capital formation, or investment, which they estimated as negative last year compared with a year earlier, the analysts added. These areas have been hit by the property downturn.\n\nThe picture chimes with the experiences of people working in China.\n\nA credit officer at a bank in central Anhui province said the value of the portfolio of outstanding loans he managed had fallen 20 per cent this year. On a recent trip to Hangzhou, capital of the wealthy neighbouring province Zhejiang, he found that a client\u2019s factory, which a year earlier had employed 1,700 people, now had 1,100.\n\n\u201cMore people are repaying their loans in advance,\u201d said the credit officer, adding that they found it \u201cmore cost-effective\u201d to reduce debt than to invest. He and his wife had also cut back on their own \u201cunnecessary\u201d spending, such as dining out.\n\nEven state-owned companies are not immune.

The country\u2019s ongoing property crisis led to a slowdown in construction, which hit demand for diesel to run heavy machinery, as well as for the petrochemicals used in paint, pipes and insulation.\n\nBut the decline stems from longer-term trends too. There was a boom in trucks switching from diesel to liquefied natural gas, and, most importantly, the rising number of electric vehicles helped to depress sales of petrol and diesel.\n\nSales of both road fuels peaked in 2023, according to China National Petroleum Corp, and will now fall by 25-40 per cent over the next decade.\n\nIn December, Sinopec, China\u2019s biggest refiner, brought forward its forecast for crude oil consumption to reach a peak to 2027, compared with the range it previously gave of between 2026 and 2030.\n\nThe implications of China hitting peak oil are enormous. If Chinese demand is reaching a plateau that would fulfil projections by the IEA of global oil demand peaking before 2030. The forecast sustains hope for the world to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nThe milestone would also shake the global economy. Over the past three decades, China has accounted for half of all growth in the world\u2019s oil demand \u2014 some 600,000 b/d.\n\nIf that rate continues to level off, the $500bn that oil companies are spending every year on finding new sources of oil and gas may be far too high. \u201cThe jury is out on whether the demand will be there to absorb it or not,\u201d says Martijn Rats, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. \u201cThe answer may be that it is not.\u201d\n\nIn the markets, the anxiety over China\u2019s weak oil demand last year kept crude prices within their narrowest trading range in over two decades in real terms.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude ended the year at just over $74 a barrel, a few dollars down from the beginning of the year, despite crises in the Middle East, the ongoing war in Ukraine, a shutdown of oil production in Libya, and a more than 20 per cent drop in Middle Eastern crude shipments to Europe because of attacks on tankers in the Red Sea.\n\nIf Chinese oil imports continue to slow, it would fundamentally change the market, says Rats. \u201cIf you have slower growth for six months or a year, then you have softer oil prices and supply slows down a bit.\n\n\u201cBut if you truly have very little oil demand growth then that is a different oil market in the future than it has been in the past.\u201d\n\nMany oil producers are loath to call this moment a turning point, sceptical that China is fading as an engine of growth.\n\n\u201cIt is too early to claim peak oil,\u201d says Meg O\u2019Neill, the chief executive of Woodside, Australia\u2019s largest oil and gas company. She points to the fact that China\u2019s economy still has a long way to go to reach western levels of per capita wealth.\n\n\u201cIf you go back over the last 20 years, there have been proclamations of peak oil at points of economic softness, and it\u2019s proven to be incorrect,\u201d she adds. \u201cChina still aspires to grow its economy and lift the standard of living and often that has a direct correlation to energy consumption.\u201d\n\nOpec, the oil cartel, has a bullish outlook for China despite last year\u2019s decline in imports, forecasting that consumption will continue to grow, by 2.5mn b/d, from 2023 to 2050. Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern producers tend to rely on Opec\u2019s data when making policy.\n\nSaudi Aramco has also rejected the idea that China is slowing down. \u201cWhen people talk about China, they are always trying to maximise the downside and ignore the upside,\u201d said Nasser last October at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh. \u201cIn general, there is still growth in China.\u201d\n\nNasser insisted there was stronger and more durable demand than official imports data implied, noting that the country\u2019s surging solar and wind power industries still required large amounts of oil.\n\n\u201cFor 5 megawatts of wind-generated power you need 50 tonnes of plastics. For every electric vehicle you need 200-230kg of plastic. Even in solar panels, 10 per cent comes from fibre and so on. So for the transition to happen you need more oil,\u201d he said.\n\nSaudi Aramco has said the public information on China\u2019s oil consumption is unreliable. Since the country does not officially report oil consumption statistics, analysts estimate it from a range of sources, including import and export data, the changes in stockpiles and the outflow from refineries. There have been a wide range of estimates, with differences of up to 1mn b/d, even for historical data.\n\nZiad al-Murshed, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, told analysts at the end of last year that significant upwards revisions to 2023\u2019s oil data \u201cmakes 2024 growth look less than it actually is. That kind of distorts the picture.\u201d\n\nAt the IEA, analysts acknowledge that assessing China\u2019s oil consumption is \u201cquite challenging\u201d. \u201cIt has been a very noisy period for Chinese demand between lockdowns and the return from lockdowns and chasing high growth,\u201d says Ciar\u00e1n Healy, an oil market analyst.\n\nNevertheless, the IEA continues to forecast that China will hit peak oil by the end of the decade. This is based on two huge, and opposing, structural trends, Healy says.\n\nThe first is the strong rise in the amount of crude oil flowing into China\u2019s rapidly growing petrochemical industry. The second is the more precipitous fall in the amount of oil needed for road transport.\n\n\u201cIn the run-up to Covid, the growth [in oil use] was quite broad based; petrochemicals, road transport, jet fuel, everything grew,\u201d says Healy. \u201cSince 2019, petrochemical production has become a bigger factor. On a net basis, all of the growth in oil consumption globally between 2019 and 2023 is actually the growth of petrochemicals in China.\u201d\n\nChina has been steadily building more petrochemical plants in order to become self-sufficient in the plastics, solvents and fibres that its factories depend on.\n\n\u201cChinese imports of polymers are still really big, but were enormous,\u201d says Healy, referring to the class of chemicals that includes nylon, polyester, polyethylene and Teflon, among others. \u201cThe statistic that blows my mind is that the [country\u2019s] imports of polymers are something like 2 to 3 per cent of the world\u2019s oil demand. That\u2019s Germany\u2019s [oil use] in demand terms.\u201d\n\nEchoing Nasser\u2019s remarks, the IEA\u2019s Healy says \u201cprobably about a quarter\u201d of China\u2019s increase in petrochemical demand over the past five years has come from wind turbines and solar panels, and says \u201cessentially all\u201d of the growth in China\u2019s oil use going forward will be from the petrochemical sector.\n\nBut the IEA believes that the fall in oil use for road transport will be more significant. \u201cBy 2030, three-quarters of cars being sold will be electric, and while you have growth in petrochemical demand, that\u2019s nowhere near strong enough to offset that decrease in road transport,\u201d says Healy. \u201cIt will plateau for a while and then start to fall a bit more sharply.\u201d\n\nIn its base case scenario, which extends all of the policies currently in place, Healy says the IEA believes China\u2019s oil consumption will fall from 16mn to 17mn b/d at present to about 12mn b/d by 2050.\n\nChina\u2019s electric vehicles boom, helped by government incentives to trade-in old cars for new, shows little sign of slowing down. The market for pure battery and plug-in hybrids is growing about 20 per cent year on year, compared with a similar contraction in petrol and diesel cars.\n\nBut some question whether the Chinese state will sit back and let peak oil happen. While the \u201crevolution\u201d in electric vehicles is both \u201cprofound\u201d and \u201cmind-boggling\u201d, says Victor Gao, chair of the China Energy Security Institute, the government will be gauging the potential impact on its huge, state-owned, oil refining industry.\n\nHe suggests that the country\u2019s state-owned refineries are unlikely to be suddenly deprived of business, but perhaps there would have to be a change in strategy.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s refining capacity is huge. Until now, China has refined petroleum for its domestic use, it does not export refined products. But if China succeeds in this EV revolution, it may decide to refine crude oil into different products for export. That means China\u2019s consumption of crude oil may not necessarily go down, it may hold steady,\u201d he says.\n\nIt is also much easier now for China to line up crude oil supplies, Gao notes, pointing to its deepening energy ties with Russia, which has been a dependable source of cheaper oil and gas since western countries imposed sanctions relating to the Ukraine war.\n\n\u201cThis is changing China\u2019s mentality,\u201d he says. \u201cIt may be much easier, if the geopolitical risks can be managed, to expand its co-operation with Russia.\u201d In 2023, Russia overtook Saudi to become China\u2019s top oil supplier.\n\nIf China\u2019s oil demand is indeed passing its peak, the consensus is that India\u2019s growth will become the main driver of growth in global oil consumption.\n\nWhile India\u2019s thirst for oil still lags far behind China, Opec believes that the country\u2019s oil use will grow by 1.5mn b/d, roughly three-quarters of China\u2019s additional demand, between 2023 and 2029, while the IEA forecasts Indian oil growth to be 1.2mn b/d by 2030.\n\nThough India has far smaller manufacturing, construction and petrochemicals sectors than China, diesel and petrol car sales have yet to be significantly displaced by electric vehicles.\n\nAccording to JMK Research, a renewables research agency, there were just under 100,000 electric cars sold in India last year, roughly 5 per cent of an electric vehicle market that is led by mopeds and e-bikes.\n\nYet analysts say that rising demand in emerging markets will not come close to matching that seen in China over the past decades. While there is likely to be material growth elsewhere in south-east Asia, the IEA said the performance of these economies would be affected if China\u2019s economic slowdown continued.\n\nOil consumption is growing across Africa and the Middle East, but remains only a tiny fraction of China\u2019s growth in absolute terms. Latin America\u2019s oil use was essentially flat, said the IEA.\n\nIn short, an end to China\u2019s oil boom would be a tectonic shift that is unlikely to be reversed, according to analysts.\n\n\u201cYou can say other countries can pick up the slack, and India\u2019s oil demand is still growing, but there was something quite oil intensive about the growth that China has pursued over the last 30 years,\u201d says Rats of Morgan Stanley.\n\nSome may disagree on the exact moment when China\u2019s appetite for oil peaks, but the IEA\u2019s Healy says long-term demand is only going in one direction \u2014 and producers and oil-exporting countries need to be prepared.\n\n\u201cIt may still be profitable for them to extract oil and gas from the ground and sell it but it will be a huge reduction in their overall income,\u201d he says. \u201cGiven how dependent those countries are on oil and gas exports, that would have massive implications.\u201d", "tag": "china?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/341f0aaa-7173-454c-89fd-103287625d38"}, {"uuid4": "26de5f6a-1696-4e1c-9b3f-5ab406161ecf", "title": "Rio Tinto sees signs of stabilisation in Chinese property", "description": "Miner says outlook for US economy stable while strong Eurozone recovery unlikely", "author": "Nic Fildes", "published_date": "2025-01-16T01:31:18.872Z", "content": "Rio Tinto, the Anglo-Australian miner, has pointed to \u201csigns of stabilisation\u201d in the Chinese property market after weak demand from the country\u2019s construction sector hit the price of iron ore last year.\n\nDemand from Chinese steel mills has driven growth for global miners over the past decade, but weakness in the housing market over the past year has triggered volatility in the iron ore price, which dropped 8 per cent during the fourth quarter, according to Rio.\n\nMiners including Rio and BHP have said commodity demand in China has shifted towards manufacturing, renewable energy and electric vehicles.\n\nRio said in a production update on Thursday that the Chinese economy provided \u201cmixed signals\u201d during the period due partly to \u201cheadwinds\u201d from the property market.\n\nHowever, the report pointed to November data on home sales and prices as showing \u201csigns of stabilisation\u201d and said there were further improvements in demand from the manufacturing and consumer sectors following government stimulus programmes to boost consumption.\n\nThe company said China\u2019s crude steel production recovered as exports partly offset weak domestic demand.\n\nThe outlook comes ahead of the release of Chinese economic data on Friday.\n\nMore broadly, Rio said the outlook for the US economy remained stable, in contrast to Europe, where the economic outlook continued to be uncertain due to uneven growth and subdued consumption.\n\n\u201cPersistent manufacturing weakness and cross-country divergence make a strong recovery unlikely,\u201d said Rio.\n\nRio is the first of the large global miners to update the market in 2025. Jakob Stausholm, chief executive, said there had been strong progress in delivering organic growth from the company\u2019s major projects, including its Mongolian copper mine Oyu Tolgoi, its Rincon lithium project in Argentina and the Simandou, an iron ore deposit in Guinea.\n\nRio\u2019s iron ore production dropped 1 per cent year on year to 85.7mn tonnes in the fourth quarter.

The industry hopes the energy transition will spark a new boom, but it will be shaped by geopolitical competition", "author": "Leslie Hook", "published_date": "2025-01-15T05:00:27.317Z", "content": "Waking from a nap at his desk, Xiao, a steel trader from Wuhan in central China, reflects on how, at the end of one of the greatest booms in recent economic history, he is a lucky survivor.\n\nAbout half of his competitors in this gritty office park, built near the site of China\u2019s first iron works, have gone bust during the country\u2019s three-year-long property crisis. The park itself is overshadowed by the enormous concrete skeleton of an unfinished real estate project.\n\n\u201cThe decline was quite severe in the first half of [last] year,\u201d says Xiao, referring to the price of rebar, a steel product used in construction to reinforce concrete. A government pivot towards economic stimulus which began in the autumn has yet to reignite real estate construction, he says. \u201cDemand is still poor.\u201d\n\nWuhan is the birthplace of China\u2019s steel industry, which rode the country\u2019s meteoric development in recent decades to become the biggest in the world.\n\nThe scale of Chinese appetite for steel has been epic. As China built up its cities, according to government data, the country consumed twice as much of the metal in the two decades from 2000 to 2020 as the US did during the entire 20th century.\n\nThis massive industrialisation and urbanisation, at a pace the world had never seen before, drove a huge commodities supercycle. It sent prices of raw materials like iron ore and steelmaking coal skyrocketing, and profoundly reshaped the global mining and energy industries.\n\nBut that supercycle, which started to wane during the Covid-19 pandemic, has now finally come to an end. Last year China\u2019s steel production fell to a four-year low, and is expected to shrink again this year. The country\u2019s consumption of iron ore, a key ingredient for making steel and iron, declined last year after peaking in 2023, according to Macquarie. There are even some indications that Chinese demand for oil is starting to peak \u2014 well before most forecasts said it would.\n\nSteele Li, vice-chair of mining company CMOC, says that the real estate boom that drove the Chinese economy has ended. \u201cThat engine is over, and I don\u2019t think it will come back, ever. So China\u2019s economy needs to find a new engine, with similar size,\u201d says Li.\n\nWhile Chinese demand has been limping along for several years, especially since the pandemic, some had hoped that the government stimulus measures would lead to a new spurt. But the resources industry has now given up hope of another construction boom, like the ones that accompanied earlier stimulus packages.\n\nExperts quibble about the exact timing of the peak in Chinese demand. But as Tom Price, head of commodities strategy at Panmure Liberum, puts it: \u201cThe China commodities supercycle is definitely over.\u201d\n\nFor the countries and companies that rode the wave of the Chinese supercycle for the past 20 years, it is a profound and at times painful shift.\n\n\u201cIs it the end of an era? It does seem like it,\u201d reflects James Campbell, steel analyst at CRU, a commodity data firm. Even with the recent stimulus measures, he says, \u201cthere is not really a way to supercharge steel demand further\u201d.\n\nWithin the industry, some executives are hopeful that the end of the China boom is coinciding with the start of a new cycle. Huge investments in clean energy, in China and around the world, have laid the foundation for another, very different kind of commodities boom.\n\nThis next phase will require lots of copper for building out electricity grids, data centres, and renewable power \u2014 as well as metals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel for electric vehicle batteries.\n\n\u201cWe are between supercycles,\u201d says Peter Toth, chief strategy officer at Newmont, a US-listed gold miner, who previously worked at BHP and Rio Tinto. \u201cWe are coming out of the China supercycle and we are still on the edge of the next supercycle, which will be driven by electrification, the energy transition and artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nHowever, if there is a new boom in commodities, it will take place in a very different global economy \u2014 one that is being shaped by competition between Beijing and Washington.\n\nThe China cycle was in many ways the apogee of the era of globalisation: Beijing was able to access open markets to feed its economy with iron ore from Brazil, copper from DRC and oil from Saudi Arabia. The demand in the next cycle, however, is more spread out geographically, with dozens of countries vying for the raw materials to build out their own renewable energy and electricity infrastructure.\n\nThat dynamic means competition over scarce resources will play a much greater role. Already western countries are racing to build their own supply chains, outside of Chinese control, for critical materials such as cobalt, lithium and copper.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, the US government has started to intervene in certain mining deals in Africa, in an effort to steer control of crucial commodities towards US-allied companies.\u00a0The political tensions around the new boom in commodities could become even sharper in Donald Trump\u2019s new term.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge in the future is the geopolitics,\u201d says Li, of CMOC. \u201cThe world is becoming more divided\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009That\u2019s the fundamental issue.\u201d\n\nBack when the last supercycle started, around 2000, the scale of the demand caught everyone by surprise.\u00a0\u201cChina came along and completely changed everything,\u201d recalls Toth, the mining executive, who joined BHP in 1994.\n\nMining giants BHP and Rio Tinto each reported more than $100bn in operating profits from iron ore during the 2000-20 period. Some in the mining industry joke that they were scooping money out of the ground.\n\nBut now the structural and demographic factors that underpinned that boom \u2014 China\u2019s rapid urbanisation and industrialisation \u2014 have become much less powerful. On a per capita basis, China has already passed the level of annual steel consumption of the US and other developed countries. The vast migration to cities, in which half a billion people moved from rural to urban settings during the boom years, is starting to slow down.\n\n\u201cPeak steel in China has been reached: structurally there is no realistic growth [in steel demand],\u201d says Marcus Garvey, head of commodities strategy at Macquarie Group. Going forward, he expects China\u2019s steel production will \u201ccycle around\u201d current levels of 1bn tonnes annually, with exports helping to compensate for slack domestic demand.\n\nChina\u2019s previous rounds of economic stimulus \u2014 including those in 2009, 2013 and 2016 \u2014 pumped money into heavy industry and construction, bolstering the steel industry again and again.\n\nBut this time is different. Starting in late September, Beijing announced a series of stimulus measures aimed at helping local governments reduce their debt, rescuing the property market, and loosening monetary policy. While some of these are directed at infrastructure or stimulating consumption to stave off an economic downturn, none of them will have the same big impact on steel. Indeed, most economists argue China needs to rebalance its economy towards household consumption and services. Another steel-heavy construction stimulus is the exact opposite of what is needed at this point in its development, they say.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of stimulus packages over the years that have kept steel demand going,\u201d says Campbell, the CRU analyst. \u201cBut what we see now is that they have reached that limit.\u201d\n\nMany Chinese steel mills have turned to exports to try to compensate for weaker demand at home. Last year China\u2019s steel exports reached 111mn tonnes, a nine-year high. But mounting trade tensions, including with the US, mean there is little room to increase exports further.\n\nOthers have shifted to produce more flat steel products, which are used in the automotive and manufacturing sectors, and fewer of the long steel products used in construction. Manufacturing, including cars, has grown to account for nearly half of Chinese steel demand.\n\n\u201cThis year, the manufacturing sector will remain the major driver to prop up China\u2019s overall steel demand,\u201d says Vivian Yang, head of editorial at MySteel, a Shanghai-based commodity data provider. \u201cBut still the property sector will be a major drag.\u201d She forecasts China\u2019s steel consumption will fall 2-3 per cent this year, after dropping 3 per cent last year.\n\nSome steel mills have had to close their doors entirely \u2014 and about 50 per cent of Chinese steel mills are losing money, according to a MySteel survey this month.\n\nIn the town of Ezhou, near Wuhan, a large privately owned steelmaker, Hongtai Steel, stopped production last year. When the FT tried to visit the plant, a receptionist said \u201cthere are no plans to resume production\u201d.\n\nThe company\u2019s slogan, written in huge letters on top of its office block, still harks back to happier times \u2014 Gang De Shi Li, Tie De Xin Yu, meaning \u201cSteel-like Strength, Iron-clad Integrity\u201d.\n\nFor the global steel industry, the rest of the world is not able to pick up the slack left by the decline in China. Although demand is growing in India, the world\u2019s second-largest steel producer, its annual domestic output is still just one-eighth of China\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe world has got to get used to slower growth,\u201d says Campbell, the analyst at CRU. He expects global steel demand growth to slow to 0.6 per cent per annum between now and 2050, compared with an average of 2 per cent annual growth over the past 20 years.\n\nIron ore prices, which have been trending down, are expected to keep falling. Macquarie\u2019s Garvey expects iron ore to fall to an average of $80 per tonne next year, from around $140 per tonne at the start of 2024.\n\nThere is a future for iron ore, but it will look different: demand is expected to shift to the higher grades of iron ore used in steelmaking processes that have significantly lower carbon emissions. Within the Chinese steel industry, the downturn could finally provide the impetus to reduce the overcapacity that has plagued the industry for decades, and speed up the retirement of older, more polluting mills.\n\n\u201cNow there will be a process of supply and demand equilibrium, finding a new level,\u201d says Toth, the mining executive at Newmont. \u201cThe low-grade seaborne [iron ore] will come out of the market, and you\u2019ll be left with the high-grade.\u201d\n\nEven as steel mills struggle, there are signs of hope for those in the resources sector more generally \u2014 particularly when it comes to copper, the metal that is central to the energy transition.\n\nNear Wuhan, in the town of Huangshi, which literally means \u201cyellow stone\u201d, producers of copper products are busier than ever.\n\nHuangshi claims a long pedigree in copper production \u2014 with evidence of mining and smelting dating back to the Bronze Age \u2014 and is home to several major smelters today. On a recent visit, a warehouse belonging to Youhe Copper was busy with trucks loading huge coils of copper sheet, coming and going late into the evening. \u201cBusiness is good this year,\u201d says a staff member.\n\nOutside China, the mining companies that made their fortunes selling materials into the Chinese real estate boom have rapidly been reorientating themselves towards what they hope to be a new copper boom. Last year BHP launched a \u00a339bn bid for Anglo American, primarily to get access to its copper assets. And Rio Tinto splashed out nearly $7bn to scoop up a lithium company, Arcadium, to tap into demand for electric vehicle batteries.\n\nAs the energy transition requires more electrical cables, more electric vehicles, and more solar and wind farms, the resulting surge in demand will be huge. Copper demand is expected to increase 50 per cent by 2040, and lithium demand is expected to surge seven-fold by that time, according to the International Energy Agency Net Zero Scenario.\n\n\u201cThe only reason these guys are coming up with these strategies is because they know China\u2019s iron ore demand has peaked, and the sector that the iron and steel went into \u2014 property and real estate \u2014 has also peaked,\u201d says Price of Panmure Liberum.\n\nThe new cycle does not revolve around China, but the country is still one of the driving forces. China remains the world\u2019s largest buyer of many raw materials \u2014 and will be the world\u2019s biggest steel producer for decades to come. Its dominance in battery materials is even greater: it controls two-thirds of global lithium and cobalt processing.\n\nThe critical minerals needed for the energy transition are often more niche than the commodities that drove the real estate boom, and lower value in terms of market size. And the trade war between the US and China is encompassing a widening circle of niche metals. After the US introduced export controls aimed at the Chinese semiconductor industry, China recently restricted its exports of gallium and germanium \u2014 which are used in certain semiconductor and defence applications.\n\nSome executives fear that the competition over resources could escalate in a dangerous manner.\n\n\u201cI personally think the next war is going to be a war of metals,\u201d says Hugo Schumann, a mining entrepreneur and chief executive of EverMetal, a Denver-based recycling investment firm. \u201cChina has so much power, because they have consolidated all the downstream production of these metals.\u201d\n\nEven if few would go that far, there is a growing recognition that competition over resources will shape the new era for commodities.\n\n\u201cThere is this collision between the upcoming critical minerals boom and heightened geopolitical tension in almost every part of the world,\u201d says Thijs Van de Graaf, energy fellow at the Brussels Institute for Geopolitics.\n\nVan de Graaf adds that Trump\u2019s recent comments on Greenland and Canada have big implications for critical minerals. \u201cUnder Trump, I expect critical raw materials to become part of a more transactional type of geopolitics.\u201d\n\nWhile mining companies see grounds for optimism, many executives are a touch nostalgic for the China boom years.\n\n\u201cAt its height, the China supercycle in iron ore was something I\u2019ve never seen,\u201d says Toth. \u201cAnd will never see again in my career.\u201d\n\nData visualisation by Steven Bernard", "tag": "china?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8ae50718-31ce-4e18-8491-33a600bbd3a5"}, {"uuid4": "3bdd4a3e-5651-4f99-99ae-3f9cb7e52169", "title": "Why China wants Musk to save TikTok", "description": "China discussing using Elon Musk as broker in TikTok deal", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-01-15T05:00:00.000Z", "content": "Saudi Aramco is to expand its investments in lithium production, officials in Beijing are discussing using Elon Musk as a broker in a potential sale of TikTok\u2019s US operations, and KPMG could soon begin offering legal services in the US.

Intel would remain an anchor investor in the new venture fund, which would begin operations under a new name in the second half of the year, it said.\n\nThe fund will now be able to raise capital from external sources for the first time. It had previously relied on a yearly budget allocation from Intel.\n\nIntel\u2019s interim co-chief executive, David Zinsner, said spinning off its venture arm was a \u201cwin-win scenario as it provides the fund with access to new sources of capital to expand its franchise while allowing both companies to continue benefiting from a productive long-term strategic partnership\u201d.\n\nThe decision follows a series of cost-cutting measures at Intel after a nightmare year for the company in 2024. Intel shares are down about 60 per cent on a year ago as the company has fallen behind on manufacturing and designing leading-edge chips.\n\nIn December, Zinsner told a Barclays conference that Intel would be constantly \u201cscrutinising where we are spending money and making sure we get the appropriate return\u201d, as the company\u2019s board pushed for \u201cfocus\u201d on its core business.\n\nFormer chief executive Pat Gelsinger was ousted by the board in December as tensions rose over his five-year capital-intensive plan to turn the company into a manufacturing powerhouse to rival Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. The multibillion-dollar plan came amid pressure on its core chip design business from competitors such as AMD and Nvidia.\n\nGelsinger was replaced by two interim co-CEOs: chief financial officer Zinsner and product chief Michelle Johnston Holthaus.\n\nIntel Capital has faced scrutiny in Washington over its exposure to Chinese technology companies. The US has sought to restrict flows of capital to Chinese groups, including this month effectively banning investment in companies producing technology such as AI, quantum computing and semiconductors.\n\nSequoia Capital and GGV Capital, formerly two of the largest US venture investors in China, spun out their Chinese businesses in 2023 under mounting political pressure.\n\nIntel Capital has continued to invest in China, owning stakes in 43 China-based technology start-ups as recently as last year, the Financial Times reported. Since the venture fund was launched in the 1990s, it has invested in more than 120 Chinese groups, according to data provider Crunchbase. Its investments have included chipmaker Horizon Robotics and Eeasy Tech, which designs AI chips for facial recognition.\n\nZinsner was the architect of a big cost-cutting initiative announced in September, which paused major manufacturing plans in Germany and Poland and aimed to drastically cut the company\u2019s real estate footprint. It followed an earlier move in August to axe 15,000 jobs.\n\nGelsinger\u2019s departure came just days after the Biden administration threw its weight behind Intel by finalising a nearly $8bn direct subsidy for its manufacturing in the US under the 2022 Chips Act.\n\nIntel is still seeking a permanent chief executive, who will have to confront difficult questions about how turn around the company, including pressure to spin off its manufacturing business.", "tag": "china?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6e6fbdeb-cc8c-4f86-9a7b-f9906dfda1fb"}, {"uuid4": "5115bcfc-2d4f-4966-a147-223518babab8", "title": "EU threatens to curb access for makers of Chinese medical devices", "description": "Report finds Beijing is discriminating against bloc\u2019s manufacturers in same field", "author": "Andy Bounds", "published_date": "2025-01-14T16:08:22.657Z", "content": "The EU has threatened to restrict access to Chinese medical devices after finding Beijing has been discriminating against the bloc\u2019s manufacturers in bids for public contracts in the same field.\n\nThe findings, which say Chinese policies force hospitals to choose domestic suppliers, follow a months-long investigation under new EU legislation seeking to prise open overseas procurement markets.\n\nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, EU trade commissioner, said he was seeking talks with Beijing over the issue.\u00a0But a failure to resolve the issue could lead to Brussels restricting access to EU contracts for Chinese companies for five years.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to prioritise dialogue as a first step to finding solutions, we stand ready to take decisive action to defend the level playing field, and support fair competition,\u201d he said.\n\nThe report risks increasing trade tensions between Brussels and Beijing, In October, the EU levied tariffs of up to 45 per cent\u00a0on Chinese electric vehicles and opened several anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations.\u00a0China responded with anti-dumping tariffs on brandy and investigations into pork and dairy products.\n\nWhile EU imports of Chinese-made devices doubled between 2015-23, the commission said Chinese policies forced hospitals to choose domestic suppliers.\n\nFor the first time Brussels used its International Procurement Instrument, a legislative measure adopted in 2022, in pursuing the probe.

Just in the past few weeks, Sheinbaum\u2019s government has imposed new tariffs on imports of clothing and other textiles as well as couriered packages from China.\n\nMonday\u2019s plan includes specific targets such as substituting 15 per cent of sewing thread imports with domestic supplies and promises a development programme for Mexican companies making polymers and wire harnesses for autos and aerospace sectors.\n\nThe USMCA, which was negotiated in Trump\u2019s first term, underpins much of Mexico\u2018s $36bn annual foreign investment and is up for a scheduled review in 2026. China\u2019s role in the region is among fundamental issues expected to be up for discussion.\n\nAsked about the Mexico plan, China\u2019s foreign affairs ministry responded that it advocated \u201cinclusive economic globalisation\u201d and \u201cwin-win results\u201d in trade.\u00a0It said it was ready to \u201cwork with all parties to safeguard\u201d global trade.\n\nCanada has also moved to tighten China\u2019s role in its economy in recent years, including tariffs on the country\u2019s electric vehicles, steel and aluminium that aligned with the steep levies imposed by the US.\n\nMexico had little public debate about China\u2019s role in its economy until recently, with investment and trade growing faster since the Covid-19 pandemic. Its trade deficit with Beijing has also widened to 38 per cent from 2018 to 2023, with large imports in the electronic equipment, vehicle and machinery sectors.\n\nTo counter this, Sheinbaum will need to attract investment by overcoming uncertainty created both by Trump and by her government\u2019s domestic agenda to overhaul the country\u2019s institutions.\n\nOn Monday, she committed to resolving two big question marks in February by publishing the rules for energy investment and for public-private investment in infrastructure.\n\nAlthough she had raised the prospect last year of retaliatory tariffs in response to Trump\u2019s threats, in recent days she has tried to stress that Mexico will have a \u201cgood\u201d relationship with the next US president.\n\n\u201cFacing any uncertainty in

"content": "The UK and China will study the feasibility of establishing exchange traded fund and wealth management connect schemes to link the capital markets of the two countries.\n\nThe announcement by the UK government follows UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 visit to Beijing last week.\n\nAs part of efforts to improve economic ties with China, the UK government said that both sides had \u201ccommitted to further their financial services relationship\u201d and would \u201cdeepen co-operation\u201d in wealth management by studying the feasibility of establishing a UK-China Wealth Connect.\n\nIt added that the governments would also assess the feasibility of setting up an UK-China ETF Connect scheme to improve capital market co-operation, and welcomed the increased number of UK subsidiaries of Chinese asset managers listing ETFs in London, including those dominated in renminbi.\n\nThe UK government said it welcomed recent licences and quota allocations China had granted to UK companies, including HSBC, Schroders, Abrdn and Aspect Capital.\n\nAspect Capital secured a private fund management licence in December, while Schroders won the final go-ahead to commence its wholly owned fund management business in China in 2023.\n\nThe UK delegation to Beijing included representatives from Abrdn, Fidelity, HSBC, London Stock Exchange Group, Prudential, Schroders, and Standard Chartered, a source familiar with matter told Ignites Asia.\n\nThe announcement also outlined plans to further enhance the UK-China Stock Connect and for the launch of a UK-China over-the-counter bond business.\n\nA Shanghai-London Stock Connect scheme was launched in 2019, allowing investors to conduct trades in different time zones across the two bourses but has not garnered the size of cross-border flows that many might have hoped.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference with China\u2019s vice-premier He Lifeng on January 11, Reeves said the two countries had signed agreements worth \u00a3600mn that represented \u201cpragmatic co-operation\u201d on financial services, trade, investment and the climate.\n\nReeves added that London was a \u201cnatural home\u201d for China\u2019s financial services companies to raise capital, and as a \u201claunch pad\u201d for Chinese companies to build a global footprint.\n\n\u201cAcross capital markets, we have opportunities to deepen connections between the UK and China,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cHowever, as we continue to strengthen our financial relationship, it is crucial that we work together even closer on regulatory co-operation,\u201d she added.\n\nVice-premier He told reporters during the press conference that China would issue an inaugural renminbi-denominated sovereign green bond in 2025.\n\nHe added that China welcomed more qualified UK banks to join the renminbi cross-border payment system and invited qualified UK institutions to apply for licences and businesses in areas such as Treasury bond and futures asset management, over-the-counter derivatives, and pension and wealth management.\n\nThe UK government announced that a joint task force would be established to support the advancement of China\u2019s capital market reforms and opening up, and enhance market attractiveness to international investors.\n\nThe task force will consist of FTSE Russell, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, with support from the China Securities Regulatory Commission.\n\nIn a Treasury policy document on the 2025 UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue that Reeves introduced in Beijing, the UK government highlighted the \u201cessential role\u201d that asset management had to play in \u201cpromoting the efficient allocation of capital and supporting growth\u201d.\n\nIn the document, the UK government highlighted a reform from 2020, saying that in recognition of the diversification and risk management private fund managers offered to investors, China had allowed foreign institutional investors to invest in private funds through the qualified foreign institutional investor scheme.\n\nThe policy document also said the two governments would conduct consultations on eligible UK fund service institutions providing services to private fund managers registered with the Asset Management Association of China.\n\nThe consultations will also cover the possible use of a master-feeder fund structure, which will be in line with domestic asset management regulations.\n\nThe UK Treasury said that both parties had agreed that portfolio delegation was an \u201cintegral norm\u201d of a financial ecosystem that enabled asset managers to promote efficiency and economies of scale.\n\n\u201cTo that end, both sides support deepening co-operation between their respective mutual fund industries and welcome their respective fund management companies to entrust the other party\u2019s financial institutions to manage their overseas investment portfolios or use their services in accordance with regulations,\u201d it read.\n\nChina has been quickly expanding its ETF connect link-ups with other markets over the past few years.\n\nAside from existing agreements with Hong Kong and Singapore, China is also reportedly looking at talks with Saudi Arabia to establish an ETF cross-listing scheme.\n\nThree large Chinese asset managers have paired up with Brazilian counterparts to plan cross-listing ETFs in each other\u2019s market, sources told Ignites Asia last year.\n\nThe Shenzhen Stock Exchange and Dubai Financial Market stock exchange last year signed a memorandum of understanding to promote cross-border investing in China and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by

The app does not have an official English name.\n\nThey added that the company was trying to capitalise on the sudden jump in traffic and may have to change content review mechanisms if American influencers start uploading posts.\n\n\u201cXiaohongshu now faces the unique challenge of managing a single platform with both Chinese and western users who have vastly different expectations around content moderation and free speech, while also maintaining compliance with Chinese internet regulations,\u201d said Olivia Plotnick, founder of the social media agency Wai Social.\u201cRapidly adapting the platform to accommodate this influx of non-Mandarin-speaking users would require significant investment and infrastructure changes that may not align with Xiaohongshu\u2019s current focus.\u201d\n\nNew US users were initially focused on introducing themselves to a Chinese audience, identifying themselves as \u201cTikTok refugees\u201d or \u201cTikTok nomads\u201d. One user named Trini was posting her book recommendations, echoing the \u201cBookTok\u201d community within TikTok, while another user known as \u201cSoCal Masker\u201d wrote in English and Chinese that he was looking \u201cforward to this new opportunity to share my content\u201d.\n\nThe sudden influx of users is largely a symbolic shift led by influencers protesting against the US move to ban TikTok, with several viral posts joking that they were simply switching to another Chinese platform. It \u201cpoints to rising dissatisfaction with Meta\u2019s platforms, which people presumed would be the beneficiary of a TikTok ban\u201d, said Plotnick.\n\nTikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance is bracing for a potential ban if the US Supreme Court does not overturn a law to block the app unless a non-Chinese buyer is found before the January 19 deadline. The court indicated on Friday that it would uphold the ban because ByteDance has close ties to the Chinese government.For TikTok\u2019s 170mn users in the US, this would not mean the platform immediately disappears, but ByteDance would be unable to update the app and performance would decline.\n\nXiaohongshu is an Instagram-like app hugely popular with young Chinese women, who use the platform for travel, dining and beauty tips. It is an important platform for fashion and beauty brands to reach affluent consumers in cities through promotions in posts or by paying influencers. It has also been steadily growing its male user base.\n\nThe company is profitable and has been one of the few success stories in a Chinese internet sector hit by bankruptcies and falling valuations. Xiaohongshu has been investing in its ecommerce business in China, trying to turn its traffic into new revenue streams. So far, it has struggled to make much of a dent in ecommerce, a heavily saturated market dominated by Alibaba\u2019s Taobao and ByteDance\u2019s Douyin, the Chinese sister version of TikTok.\n\nXiaohongshu did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the summer, Xiaohongshu was valued at $17bn in a secondary share sale in which venture capital firm DST Global bought shares from existing investors. At the peak of Chinese internet start-up valuations in 2021, the company was valued at $20bn in a funding round that included Singaporean state-backed investor Temasek.\n\nXiaohongshu is targeting an initial public offering in Hong Kong, but is waiting for Beijing to clarify its stance towards the overseas listing of large tech companies, the FT previously reported.\n\nThe start-up\u2019s IPO plans are complicated by the wealth of information it holds about Chinese consumers, which could put it in the crosshairs of Beijing\u2019s restrictions on cross-border data sharing.\n\nAdditional reporting by Hannah Murphy in San Francisco and Gavin Huang in Hong Kong", "tag": "china?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6dcbc9c1-ec7f-4a5a-b956-6904a5580d07"}, {"uuid4": "1f8082fb-e8bd-4588-9e36-f4e418469376", "title": "China\u2019s smokers light up global tobacco sales despite bans", "description": "Authorities reluctant to clamp down on crucial source of central government revenue", "author": "William Langley", "published_date": "2025-01-14T00:46:00.119Z", "content": "Hiding under a parasol from the pouring rain, smoking a cheap cigarette outside the hair salon where he works in Guangzhou, Xu is a typical Chinese smoker: he is male, started young and does not think he can quit.\n\nThe 16-year-old began smoking in his first year of middle school and now gets through more than a pack a day. \u201cAt the time, I thought it was fun, really fun,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m addicted and there\u2019s nothing to be done.\u201d\n\nUnlike in much of the world, where strict tobacco controls have led to a sharp decline in smoking, research suggests cigarette sales in China have risen in recent years, with analysts pointing to patchy, loosely enforced regulations and authorities\u2019 reluctance to clamp down on a crucial source of central government revenue.\n\nDespite a high-profile push nearly 10 years ago to reduce smoking rates from Xi Jinping, China\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, that problem has become more acute as China\u2019s economic growth has slowed, they added.\n\n\u201cThe first thing is: it\u2019s a big revenue [generator]. So that\u2019s why all the tobacco control measures are not very highly effective,\u201d said Zhengming Chen, professor of epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Population Health at the University of Oxford, adding that Chinese men were some of the heaviest smokers globally.\n\nChina produced 2.4tn cigarettes in 2023, with the number having risen in each of the previous five years and gained more than 35 per cent compared with 2003, according to figures from the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nFigures from Euromonitor show that the country\u2019s share of global sales rose to about 47 per cent last year from less than 38 per cent in 2009, echoing the findings of other studies tracking tobacco in China. The World Health Organization estimates the proportion of the population aged over 15 that use tobacco products excluding e-cigarettes falling by about four percentage points between 2000 and 2025, much slower than the global average.\n\nThe figures come as China\u2019s economy grapples with a slowdown in growth following a years-long property sector crisis and persistent concerns about weak consumer demand and deflation.\n\n\u201cWhen China\u2019s economy is in decline, the best thing is to increase the tobacco tax very substantially,\u201d said Chen, arguing that evidence from European markets showed that tripling the price of cigarettes could halve consumption and double revenues. \u201c[But] with the economic downturn, tobacco is always considered as a necessary commodity.\u201d\n\nDespite signing the WHO\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2003, China has largely left local governments to issue and enforce smoking restrictions independently, leading to a piecemeal framework that is patchily enforced, said analysts.\n\nThey also point to China National Tobacco Corporation, which holds the country\u2019s tobacco monopoly. In 2023, it generated Rmb1.5tn ($206bn) in tax revenue, according to official figures. That corresponds to about 7 per cent of central government revenue, analysts said.\n\nTogether with its regulatory arm, the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, it employs more than half a million people, according to figures from 2016.\n\nIn 2015, around the time Chinese media began reporting that Xi himself had quit smoking, Beijing enacted a citywide indoor smoking ban. Similar measures followed in Shanghai and Shenzhen in 2017.\n\nDespite a flurry of activity and a brief dip in cigarette sales at the time, a push for nationwide legislation has yet to bear fruit, partly due to pressure from the tobacco industry, said Judith Mackay, director of the Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control and an adviser to the WHO.\n\n\u201cA bunch of things have happened, but I have to say the tobacco industry was too strong for them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just massively powerful.\u201d\n\nThe cost of a pack of cigarettes in China starts from well under Rmb10 and can rise to more than Rmb100. The country does not have laws on plain packaging and only relatively weak stipulations on health warnings. Smokers have a range of ornately packaged brands to choose from, including cigarettes associated with their hometowns or with famous national landmarks.\n\nCNTC\u2019s contribution to government revenue, said Mackay, made it difficult for China to kick its cigarette habit. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive amount of money,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2019, CNTC listed shares of its international affiliate in Hong Kong, using the funds to fuel its global expansion, she added. Those shares are up more than 230 per cent since the listing and about 140 per cent last year alone.\n\nChina\u2019s National Health Commission said the government was promoting tobacco control, noting that 24 provinces and 254 cities had issued their own regulations to control smoking. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to a request for comment. CNTC was not reachable for comment.\n\nFor Fanny Huang, a finance worker in her 40s from Guangzhou who enjoys flavoured, slim cigarettes for Rmb15 a pack, the lack of public smoking bans means there are few incentives to stop smoking.\n\n\u201cI know that overseas there are very few places where you can smoke. In China, there\u2019s no such thing,\u201d said Huang, who began smoking aged 14 and now gets through about half a pack a day. \u201cI smoke whenever I have free time.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Wenjie Ding", "tag": "china?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a95fc9de-7358-4b46-b90c-4f41519d66d8"}, {"uuid4": "c4d15b24-efe2-432e-a9cd-aeb5d5987951", "title": "Pain is coming for emerging markets from a Trump trade war ", "description": "Investors are still not pricing in enough risks from fallout of US-China tensions", "author": "Manik Narain", "published_date": "2025-01-14T00:01:50.251Z", "content": "The writer is head of emerging markets cross-asset strategy at UBS\n\nAmerican exceptionalism dominates markets, with equities outperforming the rest of the world by 20 per cent last year alone. Yet one indicator, close to Donald Trump\u2019s heart, remains exceptionally weak: the trade balance. We expect this to motivate new, China-centric tariffs. But rather than in China itself, we see larger market moves playing out in the rest of the emerging world for five reasons.\n\nFirst, China is exporting its strongest disinflationary impulse in at least 30 years: its export prices are down 18 per cent from their post-Covid peak compared with a 5 per cent decline globally, according to our analysis of CPB World Trade Monitor data. This de facto real renminbi depreciation is helping exports dominate to a degree unseen since the early days of WTO accession. Chinese export volumes have risen 38 per cent over the past five years relative to a 3 per cent rise globally. This export surge is primarily being channelled into other emerging markets.\n\nThis goes beyond a simple rerouting of Chinese products destined for the US. That wouldn\u2019t explain Chinese export dominance over the rest of the emerging markets world. Instead, it reflects a continued march up the manufacturing value chain and the export of excess capacity. New tariffs would deepen the latter, with consequences for production and capex across emerging markets. Tariffs may be inflationary for the US, but the opposite will be true for those economies.\n\nSecond, tariffs may accelerate a slowdown in Chinese imports that was already coming. Commodity imports have, thus far, decoupled from China\u2019s slowdown amid robust infrastructure and manufacturing investment. New tariffs would exacerbate fiscal pressure and weaken profitability, challenging this resilience. As such, while manufacturing competitors to China have borne the brunt of its slowdown thus far, the next phase of growth deceleration will probably hit commodity exporters, too. Fiscal stimulus won\u2019t compensate. That is tilting towards consumption \u2014 positive for the consumer and internet companies that dominate Chinese stocks \u2014 but with little spillover to broader emerging markets.\n\nThird, with growth now slowing in large parts of developing economies, markets are in a weak position to navigate a potential Trade War 2.0. Outside China, where we see tariffs driving GDP growth to 3 per cent next year, emerging markets investment is stuck at 2008 levels as a share of GDP. Exports also have flattened out and foreign direct investment is failing to accelerate despite hopes of \u201cfriendshoring\u201d. Stronger support in the form of monetary policy easing is needed but persistently elevated US rates limit the ability of emerging markets to provide this without disturbing currencies and, in several cases, credit spreads.\n\nFourth, tariff-sensitive industries such as autos, steel, transport infrastructure and electrical equipment constitute a higher share of emerging markets equities, particularly outside China, than in developed economies. This vulnerability is arguably reflected in Chinese equity valuations, which haven\u2019t recovered from Trade War 1.0 but not in the rest of emerging markets where valuations are 30 per cent higher despite flat return on equity.\n\nFinally, emerging markets outside China also face more challenging trade negotiations with Trump than ever before. US trade deficit composition has shifted dramatically such that China now accounts for \u201conly\u201d 27 per cent while the rest of the emerging markets world constitutes 55 per cent. Deficits with Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand have risen particularly quickly, bringing greater uncertainty.\n\nSome investors believe that valuations already price in such risks after recent underperformance. We disagree.\n\nThe UBS Emerging Markets Risk Appetite Index stands roughly halfway between risk neutrality and risk euphoria \u2014 atypically strong relative to the state of global growth. Analysts expect 14 per cent earnings growth in emerging markets in 2025-26 compared with 4 per cent realised during the 2018-19 trade spat. The cost of purchasing protection against even half the renminbi depreciation seen in 2018-19 is in the bottom quartile of a 10-year range. Emerging market credit spreads across all ratings buckets have now compressed to the 18th percentile or lower of their distribution after the financial crisis.The biggest draw for emerging markets is high real rates and disinflation. This provides opportunities in fixed income, particularly currency-hedged local debt. But growth-sensitive assets \u2014 equities and especially currency \u2014 look vulnerable.", "tag": "china?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/93741af5-3f31-4136-9e9b-3da34a659db5"}, {"uuid4": "1d672572-5702-4c6c-962c-097afcb3a235", "title": "US imposes export controls on chips for AI to counter China", "description": "American semiconductor industry warns move will aid competitors while EU has also protested against the new rules", "author": "Demetri Sevastopulo", "published_date": "2025-01-13T22:02:44.663Z", "content": "The US is imposing expansive export controls on chips used for artificial intelligence in an effort to make it harder for China and other adversaries to get access to advanced technology with military applications.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s administration on Monday unveiled an export control regime that gives 20 close allies and partners uninhibited access to AI-related chips while placing licensing requirements on most other countries.

The country\u2019s trade surplus in December was $104.8bn, a record for a single month and up from $97.4bn in November.\n\nExports rose 10.7 per cent last month on a year earlier in dollar terms, the customs figures showed, while imports climbed 1 per cent, beating average analyst forecasts from Reuters of a 7.3 per cent rise and 1.5 per cent decline, respectively.\n\nIn November, exports rose 6.7 per cent year on year, while imports shrank 3.9 per cent.\n\nThanks to a big policy push from President Xi Jinping \u2014 who has vowed to invest in \u201cnew productive forces\u201d, or cutting-edge industries \u2014 China has also been a leading producer of green-energy products such as solar panels and batteries for electric vehicles.\n\nIt has also grown within a few years to become a global automotive powerhouse, surpassing Japan as the world\u2019s biggest car exporter.\n\nThe country\u2019s trade surplus with the US increased 6.9 per cent in 2024 compared with a year earlier, to $361.03bn, Chinese customs figures showed.\n\nNomura analysts noted, however, that the share of US exports in China\u2019s shipments was gradually declining, to 14.7 per cent in 2024 from 14.8 per cent a year earlier, boosted by the front-loading.\n\nMany manufacturers have also been diversifying production from China to friendly regional countries to avoid trade tariffs and other restrictions. The share of Chinese exports to south-east Asian countries rose 16.4 per cent in 2024, from 15.5 per cent a year earlier.\n\n\u201cThe decline in the share of exports to the US and significantly increased share to Asean could provide some buffers to China\u2019s exports against the likely upcoming trade tension,\u201d Nomura said. But it added that if the US targeted rerouting of exports to south-east Asia from China, the region\u2019s share could also be hit.\n\nHSBC economists said the export boost could fade as tariffs set in, posing a challenge for Chinese policymakers wrestling with lagging domestic demand.\n\n\u201cWith global trade uncertainties likely to pick up, the front-loading boost may fade and more policy support will be needed to boost domestic demand,\u201d they wrote in a note.\n\nAdditional reporting by Haohsiang Ko in Hong Kong", "tag": "china?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f71a3570-020f-4c43-a0ab-7143f5f9fd98"}, {"uuid4": "efb70af8-9337-4e21-aafb-9edd89e761a9", "title": "China building new mobile piers that could help possible Taiwan invasion", "description": "Satellite images reveal barge-like vessels that could help transport tanks and artillery over coastal mudflats", "author": "Kathrin Hille", "published_date": "2025-01-13T09:13:30.325Z", "content": "China is building a new class of mobile piers, satellite images reveal, which could bolster its ability to land an invading force in Taiwan, a major step in its preparations for a potential future attack.\n\nSatellite images captured on Friday and reviewed by the Financial Times show six barge-like vessels equipped with extendable ramps under construction at China\u2019s state-owned Guangzhou Shipyard. The vessels could help the People\u2019s Liberation Army transport heavy military equipment such as tanks and artillery across mudflats or seawalls on to firm ground.\n\nThe construction of the vessels, first reported by defence website Naval News, comes as the PLA is trying to close large gaps in the capabilities needed to launch an attack on Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory and has threatened to annex by force if Taipei resists unification indefinitely.\n\nLast month, China unveiled a new hybrid amphibious assault vessel, the largest of its kind in the world, which military commentators likened to a \u201clight aircraft carrier\u201d.\n\nCalls seeking comment from China\u2019s defence ministry went unanswered on Monday.\n\nAccording to Chinese military academic papers, the PLA would target ports and airports in the event of an invasion of Taiwan to allow it to bring in troops and materiel. Amphibious beach landings would be necessary if that approach failed or fell short, as hundreds of thousands of soldiers would be needed to conquer and control the island.\n\nIn amphibious landing exercises since at least 2020, China\u2019s military has experimented with floating docks and causeways for unloading armoured vehicles and other gear from ferries and other ships.\n\nBut the barges under construction in Guangzhou have several pairs of pylons resembling the legs of offshore oil rigs, suggesting they can be anchored in the coastal silt.\n\n\u201cThe PLA has probably come to the realisation that those floating systems are too vulnerable to attack because they take too long to assemble, and also just can\u2019t handle heavy wind and waves as they have no stabilisation,\u201d said Michael Dahm, senior resident fellow for aerospace and China studies at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in Washington and a former naval intelligence officer.\n\nChinese military researchers have repeatedly highlighted the importance of stabilised landing gear and the weaknesses of floating systems in papers published in military logistics journals in recent years.\n\n\u201cSuch concerns were reinforced by the challenges the US had with its floating pier in Gaza,\u201d Dahm said. The US plan to deliver humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territory via a floating pier last summer collapsed after just 20 days, after waves damaged and then broke the specially built, $230mn structure.\n\nAnalysts believe that an amphibious invasion of Taiwan would be one of the most difficult operations in military history. Long stretches of the coast comprise cliffs, reefs and rocks, while the flatter western seaboard is lined with mudflats in which heavy equipment could easily become stuck.\n\nMost of the coastline is also separated from inland areas by concrete seawalls or wave-breaking concrete blocks.\n\nShore-based lifting equipment such as the new barges could help an invasion force overcome such obstacles, analysts said. The satellite images showed mobile piers of three different sizes. The largest, with eight pylons, was 183 metres long and had a ramp extending another 128 metres.\n\nBut military experts said a Chinese invasion force would still struggle to advance through Taiwan\u2019s western plains, which are densely packed with paddy fields, fish ponds and urban sprawl, with wide roads often hard to reach from shore.\n\nTaiwanese observers said the PLA\u2019s new capability reinforced the need for Taipei to target Chinese forces before they reached shore.\n\n\u201cIt is their large amphibious assault ships, their helicopters and airborne forces that we must be able to target,\u201d said Lin Ying-yu, an assistant professor at the Graduate Institute for International Affairs and Strategic Studies at Taiwan\u2019s Tamkang University.\n\n\u201cIt is like in baseball,\u201d Lin added. \u201cThey may have chosen a very good closer, but if we fight well in the first wave, that skill will not come to bear.\u201d", "tag": "china?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/36a00ba4-6178-4267-9786-3e0b59abe67f"}, {"uuid4": "20726dde-3000-4a3d-b1c4-faf9b272c21d", "title": "Porsche China deliveries drop 28% as competition intensifies", "description": "Fall comes as consumers in world\u2019s largest car market increasingly opt for domestic brands", "author": "Patricia Nilsson", "published_date": "2025-01-13T08:23:38.272Z", "content": "Porsche has revealed a drop of more than a quarter in its deliveries to Chinese customers, as a \u201cchallenging economic situation\u201d in the country continues to bite.\n\nThe German sports-car maker said on Monday it had delivered 56,887 vehicles to China last year, down 28 per cent on 2023 and offsetting growth in all other regions, pushing Porsche\u2019s total deliveries down 3 per cent to 310,718.\n\nSliding sales in the world\u2019s largest car market come at a bad time for Porsche\u2019s parent company Volkswagen, which is grappling with declining demand in Europe and lower than expected sales of its electric vehicles, which are facing growing competition from cheaper Chinese rivals.\n\nVW\u2019s management last month backed down from plans to close several German factories following intense pushback from its powerful labour representatives.\n\nSales in China \u2014 long VW\u2019s most profitable market \u2014 have continued to drop.

Yet the economic and financial fates of the two nations, accounting for over 40 per cent of global GDP, are intertwined.\u00a0Decoupling is nary impossible.\n\nCurrency feuds have long been a staple of US and China relations. They reached a feverish pitch in the US before the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when China was running a 10 per cent of GDP current account surplus and reserves soared on the back of heavy intervention and a persistently undervalued currency.\n\nFollowing the financial crisis, when its current account surplus came sharply down, Beijing still continued to amass reserves, reaching $4tn. After a period of economic weakness and growth scares in 2015-16 led China to make $1tn in dollar sales from reserves to prop up the renminbi, tensions temporarily quieted.\u00a0But under Donald Trump in his first term as president, the US Treasury in 2019 designated China a currency manipulator after renminbi depreciation.\n\nThe dollar is now strong across the board. It\u2019s largely a Made in the USA story, reflecting the firm US economy, relatively shallower prospective pace of interest rate cuts, tariff threats and probable fiscal action that will extend the already huge US deficit and supply of Treasuries coming on to the market, pushing up longer-term rates.\n\nTeam Trump believes the dollar is overvalued, as shown in its ham-fisted backing for \u201cdevaluation\u201d.\u00a0The reality is that their aspiration flies in the face of Trump 2.0\u2019s likely macroeconomic and trade policies.\n\nChina also frets about a further weakening of the renminbi against the dollar. Such depreciation could threaten to trigger sharp capital account pressures, reminding authorities of those in 2015-16, an experience they do not wish to see replicated.\u00a0A weakening renminbi could limit the ability of the central bank to further ease monetary policy in the face of China\u2019s current deflationary pressures and deep-seated economic malaise. Meanwhile, the authorities recognise that Chinese exports hardly need to gain further competitiveness \u2014 the real trade-weighted renminbi fell nearly 15 per cent over the past three years. Export volumes are up strongly.\n\nOn balance, I believe China and the US want to see a stronger renminbi against the dollar.\u00a0Accordingly, China and the US could undertake a joint operation on the currency. They could issue a statement, announcing the operation. At that moment, China\u2019s central bank, which has eschewed direct intervention for years, would visibly enter the Asian markets on its own account with dollar sales/renminbi purchases.\u00a0While Beijing would undertake the bulk of the intervention, Washington could carry on the operation in London and New York.\n\nWould such a project work? It would surely not tackle the underlying macroeconomic policy drivers and differing cyclical positions in the US and China.\u00a0Foreign exchange market intervention in major floating currencies is largely ineffective, unless perhaps massive and repeated and/or signalling a change in underlying policies.\n\nBut the Chinese authorities retain significant control of the renminbi on foreign exchange markets. That reality and the effect of an announcement could have a potent impact on the exchange rate and market psychology. One might question whether the impact would endure, but that would need to be seen.\n\nRenminbi depreciation would offset the impact of any large US tariffs on Chinese goods. In contrast, appreciation should limit the need for tariffs. Interestingly, the US would acquire renminbi and might then need to hold reserves in the currency.\n\nSuch an operation is a far cry from fanciful discussions about a Mar-a-Lago Accord, modelled on the Plaza Accord which was premised on macroeconomic policy co-ordination and intervention.\u00a0That might work in a financial crisis, but not when cyclical conditions vary.\u00a0For example, Trump is hardly going to forgo extending his 2017 tax cuts to reduce US fiscal deficits and China isn\u2019t going to hike interest rates to prop up the renminbi.\n\nBut despite bilateral tensions, Washington and Beijing have common economic and financial interests.\u00a0Thinking about the idea could help promote a sliver of co-operation between Team Trump and the Chinese leadership and serve their mutual interests.", "tag": "china?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d3b649c3-84b5-4100-ada3-8dc9e8f52497"}, {"uuid4": "633a174e-1d24-4e69-b1b3-31ae4d1bccaa", "title": "Singapore banks tighten scrutiny of clients after money-laundering scandal ", "description": "Customers from China in spotlight as waiting times stretch to four months to open accounts", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2023-09-24T01:30:42.806Z", "content": "Banks in Singapore are stepping up scrutiny of customers from a range of countries including China and intensifying efforts to identify the sources of wealth as the city-state reels from a ballooning S$2.4bn (US$1.8bn) money-laundering scandal.\n\nFinancial institutions have warned customers and their advisers that the waiting period to open a private banking account has increased from less than one month to three to four, according to wealth advisers, asset managers and private bankers.\u00a0Some existing accounts are being closed, the people added.\n\nThe longer processing times are not an official rule change, the people said, but a reflection of authorities tightening due diligence across the financial sector after a transnational money laundering syndicate was exposed in August.\n\nThe institutions are focusing on customers from countries including China, Vanuatu, Turkey, St Kitts and Nevis, Dominica and Cyprus.\n\n\u201cIf you have a People\u2019s Republic of China passport, or possess a passport from any of the countries the suspects involved in the probe had, such as Cyprus, Vanuatu or Cambodia, you are getting red-flagged,\u201d said one adviser in private banking.\n\nSingapore police last month arrested and charged 10 people and have seized more than S$2.4bn in assets including luxury properties, gold bars, designer handbags, cash, crypto assets\u00a0and cars in one of the city-state\u2019s largest-ever money-laundering probes.\n\nThe suspects, who have been denied bail, all had Chinese passports.

In 2021, the wealth of households with investable assets of $100,000-$1mn in Asia totalled $2.7tn, according to the consultancy, a sum projected to climb to $4.7tn by 2026 as incomes continue to rise across the region.\n\nWith the move to Singapore, \u201cthe Caymans aren\u2019t just rolling out the red carpet for Asia\u2019s wealthy; they\u2019re laying down a runway for private jets\u201d, said Kher Sheng Lee, co-head of the Alternative Investment Management Association for Asia.\n\nSingapore and Hong Kong have launched fund structures in recent years to lure business from low-tax havens such as the Cayman Islands, Mauritius and the British Virgin Islands. The schemes allow investors to hold money in lightly taxed vehicles with generous government subsidies.\n\nSingapore, which has long prospered as a stable and predictable environment for business, has had more success than Hong Kong in attracting managers and wealthy family offices to establish funds.\n\nSingapore\u2019s new \u201cvariable capital companies\u201d have exploded in popularity since their introduction in 2020, with 937 set up as of August. The uptake of Hong Kong\u2019s \u201copen-ended fund companies\u201d has been slower, with 112 registered with the city\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission as of the end of last year, according to law firm Deacons. Hong Kong\u2019s OFC regime was launched in 2018.\n\nThe vehicles are popular with family offices, hedge funds and other private equity firms managing money.\n\n\u201cThere has been very rapid growth in family offices in Singapore in the\u00a0past few years and this is the Cayman Islands keeping themselves on their\u00a0radar,\u201d said Joel Seow, a private investment funds lawyer at Linklaters. \u201cThis is recognition that there is a growing and maturing market in Asia in terms of size, depth and sophistication\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they want options.\u201d\n\nThe number of family offices in Singapore has soared from just a handful in 2018 to well over 1,000.\n\n\u201cInvestors have compelling reasons to consider the Cayman Islands, given their tried-and-true fund structures.

At homes across the city \u2014 always in the wealthiest neighbourhoods \u2014 similar scenes were repeating as police rounded up people suspected of belonging to a billion-dollar money-laundering ring.\n\nOnce upstairs, the officers banged on the bedroom door. When they entered, Su Haijin, a 40-year-old man of Chinese, Cambodian and Cypriot nationality, was gone. But not very far.\u00a0On hearing the police, Su had hurled himself off the second-floor balcony, fracturing his hands and legs. Police found him hiding in a nearby drain.\n\nThe case, in which Su and nine others have been charged so far, has captivated a public wholly unused to seeing the insalubrious side of their country laid bare. It is not just the trappings of the S$1.8bn ($1.3bn) bust \u2014 gold bars, designer handbags, luxury cars, lavish property and digital fortunes \u2014 that have fascinated. Global banks, precious metal dealers, property agents and one of the country\u2019s most famous golf clubs have also been sucked into the scandal.\n\nSingapore has for decades prospered in no small measure due to its reputation as the \u201cSwitzerland of the east\u201d \u2014 a safe and neutral haven for business in an at-times intractable part of the world.\n\nThe investigation has captured global attention, \u201cnot just due to its size and links to Chinese money\u201d, says Chong Ja Ian, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, \u201cbut also because it underscores the risks as Singapore tries to reshape itself in a more competitive and fragmented world\u201d.\n\nSingapore, he adds, wants to be \u201ca premium place for premium business, not just a Cayman Islands or a Mauritius, a place where global capital can come in and be reinvested elsewhere. But a raid of this scale shows the model has serious drawbacks.\u201d\n\nWhile Singapore\u2019s open, trade-reliant economy has proved resilient to external shocks such as rising global protectionism and supply chain fragmentation, the raid comes at a sensitive and destabilising time.\n\nThe city-state is wrestling with rising inequality \u2014 linked to unrestrained capital inflows from the US, Europe and especially China \u2014 as it prepares for its first change of leader in almost 20 years.\u00a0Some are questioning whether an economic model so reliant on foreign capital is benefiting citizens in the way it once did.\n\nThere is also the delicate matter of deteriorating Sino-US relations. As more mainland Chinese cash and influence seeps out of China and into Singapore, the country\u2019s high-wire balancing act between Beijing and Washington becomes even more precarious. All 10 accused in the money-laundering sting share one thing in common: possession of a passport believed to be issued in China.\n\nThe test for Singapore\u2019s ruling People\u2019s Action party, analysts say, will be its ability to keep citizens convinced of the merits of remaining pro-globalisation and welcoming of foreign capital. Navigating the US-China split will depend on it.\n\n\u201cAll foreign policy is domestic policy,\u201d says Donald Low, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and a former civil servant in Singapore. \u201cWhat will shape how Singapore manages its international agenda is how they can manage these domestic tensions.\u201d\n\nUnder the iron leadership of Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of modern Singapore who died in 2015, the city-state was propelled after independence from Malaysia in 1965 from a south-east Asian backwater into one of the world\u2019s most successful economies.\n\nLee understood that encouraging foreign investment, the immigration of skilled workers and swift adoption of new technology was part of nation-building. At a time when many countries were suspicious of global multinational corporations, Lee welcomed them with low taxes and subsidies, marrying capitalism with a welfare state that protected citizens and provided housing, medical care and education.\n\nSingapore benefited from a period of rapid industrialisation and globalisation worldwide, its strategic location making it an ideal hub for trade and commerce. In 1965, per capita gross domestic product was a mere $516 compared with $91,000 today \u2014 higher than the US, Australia, France and the UK, and not far behind Switzerland.\n\nThe economic boom continued under Lee\u2019s successors, first Goh Chok Tong and then Lee\u2019s son, Lee Hsien Loong, who came to power in 2004.\n\nEven the US-China decoupling and other global shocks, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, have not derailed its progress. Stable Singapore has even benefited from the external disorder.\n\n\u201cThere is a paradox that smaller open economies benefit from worsening bilateral relations,\u201d says David Bach, a professor at the International Institute for Management Development in Switzerland. \u201cAs a result of recent dynamics Singapore has become a lot safer for investors and multinationals to conduct business.\u201d\n\nSingapore\u2019s \u201csafe hub\u201d reputation \u2014 coupled with its low taxes \u2014 has helped the city-state to compete with the massive industry subsidies on offer across large developed economies in the US and Europe, such as the US\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act or the EU\u2019s Green Deal.\n\nSingapore receives a bigger percentage of US foreign direct investment into Asia-Pacific than China and Hong Kong combined. Overall foreign direct investment inflows surged to S$195bn last year, its highest level ever and a 10 per cent increase from S$176bn in 2021. Singapore attracted a record S$22.5bn in fixed asset investments in 2022 despite the global headwinds.\n\nMany think the money-laundering scandal will have little long-lasting impact on Singapore\u2019s reputation overseas.\n\n\u201cThe money is pouring in,\u201d says Parag Khanna, founder and managing partner of FutureMap, a global strategic advisory firm. Investors want somewhere \u201cgenuinely open, home to everyone and that isn\u2019t dominated by one power. Hong Kong has long since ceased to be that pan-Asian hub.\u201d\n\nAmong the multinationals that call Singapore home is German conglomerate Siemens. Roland Busch, chief executive, said in June that the company chose Singapore over places with cheaper labour and property costs such as India and Indonesia to build a new high-tech factory. Globally connected Singapore, Busch said, was a \u201clighthouse of stability\u201d.\n\nEven with slowing global growth and weak local demand, Singapore has avoided a recession. Core inflation slowed for a third straight month in July to a year-on-year rate of 3.8 per cent. Unemployment was 1.9 per cent in the second quarter of this year. By comparison, in the same quarter Hong Kong recorded a rate of 2.9 per cent, London was at 5.1 per cent and, in June, New York\u2019s rate was 5.4 per cent.\n\nYet while it thrives as a global power, Singapore has domestic concerns. The long-ruling People\u2019s Action party is grappling with only its third change in leadership since independence, with finance minister and deputy prime minister Lawrence Wong \u2014 the so-called 4G or fourth generation leader \u2014 likely to take the reins.\n\nWong will take over at a time when the PAP\u2019s share of the popular vote is at historic lows. The timing of the handover remains unknown and whether Lee or Wong will lead the PAP through the next general election \u2014 due to be held by November 23, 2025 \u2014 is unclear.\u00a0While the PAP\u2019s grasp on power in the quasi-authoritarian democracy remains firm, the opposition Workers\u2019 party won a record 10 out of 93 contested seats in the 2020 general election for Singapore\u2019s parliament.\n\nFor Singaporeans preparing for this next era, the opacity of the succession plan adds to an underlying sense of unease about the city-state\u2019s identity. \u201cPhilosophically and emotionally, it\u2019s the sense that the \u2018Switzerland of the east\u2019 is actually designed more for global plutocrats than ordinary Singaporeans,\u201d says Sudhir Vadaketh, editor of Jom, a Singaporean weekly magazine.\n\nSome see Singapore as a way station, others a nation home, others a bit of both, Vadaketh adds. \u201cThere\u2019s an inherent existential tension between the two that expresses itself in different ways, and requires perpetual management from politicians and bureaucrats. [August\u2019s] money-laundering case, for many people, reminds us that we may be leaning too much towards \u2018global city\u2019.\u201d\n\nSingapore, whose own population is ageing, has become a favoured home for Asia\u2019s millionaires, prompting local pushback to foreign workers and immigration. House prices and rents have skyrocketed, with the median price of a private home hitting $1.2mn in 2022, the highest among cities in the Asia-Pacific, according to data from the Urban Land Institute Asia Pacific Centre for Housing. Rents for private homes outpaced even New York City at the end of last year.\n\nMany Singaporeans are somewhat shielded thanks to a government housing scheme. Close to 80 per cent live in state flats and the majority own their home via long-term leases from the government. But even here higher costs are trickling through.\n\n\u201cI am moving back in with my parents because the landlord at the Housing Development Board flat I was renting with a friend lifted the rent from $3,000 per month to $5,000. That is crazy for a two-bedroom apartment,\u201d says Nicole, a Singaporean living in Tiong Bahru who did not want to give her full name.\n\nFuelling a large part of this spike in housing costs, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic, has been the movement of rich Chinese, not just tycoons but also talented citizens with specific skills. Many are fleeing a \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d campaign \u2014 aimed at redistributing more of China\u2019s wealth \u2014 and a crackdown on multiple industries including property, healthcare, technology and education.\n\n\u201cSingapore-washing\u201d, where mainland Chinese companies redomicile and rebrand as Singapore-based international businesses as a hedge against geopolitical risk, has increased. Of 63,801 new corporate entities formed in Singapore last year, 29 per cent had majority foreign ownership, according to analytics group Handshakes. Of those 7,312 were from China, up from 4,951 in 2021. Even HongShan, formerly known as Sequoia China, a mainland investment juggernaut which has long focused its financial firepower on Chinese technology start-ups, opened a Singapore office this year.\n\n\u201cIt used to be they all fled to Hong Kong but now Singapore has unintentionally become a favoured destination for rich Chinese but also Chinese professionals,\u201d says Low, the former civil servant. \u201cOf course there is a reaction to that [in Singapore]. They raise prices all around and fuel the politics of envy.\u201d\n\nThe city-state drew in more money than ever before in 2021, with S$448bn in new funds, according to the most recent data available from its central bank, a number expected to be even higher for 2022.\n\nBut the S$1.8bn money-laundering scandal will reinforce some critics\u2019 view that Singapore acts as a bolt-hole for less-than-respectable money or flight capital. Since the pandemic, Singapore has seen an explosion of activity in its decentralised financial market: family offices, private banking and new discreet, lightly taxed funds. These are harder to regulate and to justify as benefiting the mainstream Singaporean economy, for instance there has not been a parallel jump in stock market listings.\n\n\u201cI think the money-laundering probe barely scratches the surface of the illicit activity that has gone on here for years,\u201d says the Singaporean head of a large international investment bank in the city, referring to wealthy Indonesians and other rich south-east Asian individuals who have used the city-state to keep their wealth. \u201cIt is something the government must manage better or risk the rise of populism and xenophobia that has swept through so many other countries.\u201d\n\nThe flow of money into Singapore is not only from China, nor is it the only country affected by the way elite Chinese people are shifting money overseas. But it does provide a colourful, timely example of how Singapore\u2019s neutrality could eventually be affected.\n\nKenneth Jeyaretnam, the secretary-general of the opposition Reform party, on his Facebook page noted the money-laundering raids took place days after a visit by China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, and suggested there was \u201cforeign pressure\u201d.\n\nThe PAP has rejected this assertion and issued Jeyaretnam with a correction order under its online falsehoods or so-called fake news law. The financial regulator said that suspicious fund flows and other inconsistencies with documentation prompted banks in the city state to file reports to the authorities.\n\nOne Washington-based policymaker tells the Financial Times that the Biden administration is \u201cwatching more closely than ever before\u201d the Chinese companies and people moving to Singapore. \u201cThe more the volumes of money and people that come in, the more Beijing might start to feel it can intervene in Singaporean affairs,\u201d they say.\n\nThe Chinese Communist party is often accused of using its soft power machine to influence Singaporeans \u2014 the majority of whom are ethnic Chinese \u2014 and the mainland Chinese who have emigrated there.\n\nA recent Washington Post report suggested Beijing was using the Singaporean Chinese Lianhe Zaobao newspaper to sway opinions in the city-state. When asked about the report, Singapore\u2019s ambassador-at-large Chan Heng Chee in August said the government was \u201cwell aware of these activities\u201d and was \u201cvigilant against agents of influence of all countries\u201d.\n\nThe Singapore newspaper said in a statement that the Washington Post\u2019s article \u201cmade biased comments and unfair statements about Lianhe Zaobao\u201d. The media organisation added it \u201ctakes its mission of delivering information seriously and remains committed to neutrality\u201d.\n\nThe PAP formally upgraded its relationship with Beijing this year in areas including technology as well as supply chains. The two launched a new bilateral defence hotline in June and restarted military drills after a pandemic-related pause. Singapore has at the same time maintained its close relations with the US military.\n\nBut the party admits Singapore\u2019s position is tricky. Wong, the prime minister-in-waiting, this year said the rift between Beijing and Washington \u201cappears insurmountable\u201d.\n\nSingapore has \u201cone foot firmly in each canoe, gaining benefits from both [the US and China],\u201d says Drew Thomson, a visiting senior research fellow at National University of Singapore\u2019s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \u201cBut those canoes are drifting apart, can you really play both sides forever?\u201d\n\nData visualisation by Andy Lin and Keith Fray", "tag": "singapore?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b66e2f92-1b92-47af-8f4b-f2a1abcedfbd"}, {"uuid4": "86cf499b-86d2-4187-88ac-294261e72aaf", "title": "Singapore seeks documents from banks in money laundering probe", "description": "Authorities widen $737mn investigation that has cast scrutiny on financial hub\u2019s embrace of foreign wealth", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2023-08-23T12:41:12.892Z", "content": "Singapore authorities have requested documents from at least 10 banks as they extend a S$1bn (US$737mn) money laundering investigation.\n\nPublic prosecutors told a court on Wednesday that they were seeking documents from financial institutions used by 10 people who were arrested last week and charged in one of the city-state\u2019s biggest-ever money laundering and fraud cases.\n\nProsecutors asked the court to extend the remand for those arrested for a further eight days.\n\nThe suspects were detained in an operation that spanned the city-state and led to the seizure of luxury homes, cars, designer handbags and wads of cash and gold bars.\n\nThe names of two banks \u2014 Citigroup\u2019s Singapore subsidiary and Malaysia\u2019s CIMB \u2014 emerged when charges against those arrested were published last week.

But in Singapore, where the government has justified its decades-long rule \u2014 and tight social controls \u2014 by maintaining an image of competence and reliability, they represented a threatening rupture for the city-state of five million people.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last week stepped in to reassure citizens that his People\u2019s Action party, which was founded by his father Lee Kuan Yew and has governed uninterrupted since before Singapore became a republic in 1965, was as strong and reliable as ever.\n\nVisibly frustrated with criticism of the country\u2019s anti-graft body, which reports to the prime minister, Lee declared the organisation \u201chas to answer to somebody. It cannot answer to God.\u201d\n\nWhile Lee promised to \u201cprotect the integrity\u201d of the government in a National Day address on Wednesday, last month\u2019s events underscored the perceived opacity in the decision-making of the long-ruling party, just as it is preparing for its first leadership change in nearly two decades.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of conspiracy theories because nobody can really tell what is going on within the PAP and with the internal workings or decision-making,\u201d said Chong Ja Ian, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore. \u201cThe accumulation of these events does create a sense of bewilderment and unease on the direction of travel and as Singapore faces new leadership in a more contentious world.\u201d\n\nFor critics, the turmoil last month also called into question the PAP\u2019s ability to effectively manage domestic politics at a crucial juncture for the city-state. Singapore is juggling growing challenges at home including a backlash against foreign workers, rising costs and inequality, tensions between the US and China and a shift away from the globalising forces that boosted its open, trade-reliant economy and made it a global financial centre.\n\nOne of the main issues undercutting public confidence has been the lack of visibility of the next generation of leadership, critics said. The PAP last year picked Lawrence Wong to succeed Lee, who has led Singapore since 2004.\n\nCritics say the 4G leaders, so called because Wong would be only the fourth prime minister in Singapore\u2019s history, have not offered a vision for the city-state\u2019s future at a time when the drivers of its past growth are expected to face mounting headwinds. The timing of Lee\u2019s handover also remains unclear.\n\n\u201cWhere are the 4G leaders? By rights, Wong should be prime minister by now but I think Lee will now hold on until the next election,\u201d which must be held by 2025, said Michael Barr, associate professor of international relations at Flinders University in Adelaide and author of The Ruling Elite of Singapore.\n\nLee postponed a plan to step aside before he turned 70 in 2022 so he could hand over Singapore \u201cintact\u201d after the pandemic. In the 2020 election, the PAP earned one of the lowest shares of the popular vote in the country\u2019s history.\n\nAdding to the intrigue around inner party workings, many regard the PAP as becoming more, not less, sensitive to criticism. Politicians have wielded the country\u2019s fake news law to silence online criticism, experts said.\n\nIn July, authorities invoked the Protection Against Online Falsehoods Act against the prime minister\u2019s estranged younger brother Lee Hsien Yang, who resides overseas, over a Facebook post criticising the government\u2019s handling of the spate of recent scandals.\n\n\u201cThis does not help the PAP in navigating a complex and turbulent global environment. The last thing Singapore needs are these sorts of issues which erode trust in government and fuel the impression that the rich and powerful look after themselves,\u201d said Donald Low, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and a former civil servant in Singapore.\n\n\u201cWhen people can\u2019t criticise, they channel that unhappiness and resentment into the kind of areas that have driven Brexit and the rise of Trump,\u201d he added.\n\nThe events have raised the stakes for the presidential elections in September. The role is largely ceremonial, but experts said the poll would provide a gauge of public sentiment. While the PAP\u2019s grasp on power in the quasi-authoritarian democracy remains firm, the opposition Workers\u2019 party won a record 10 out of 93 contested seats in the 2020 general election for Singapore\u2019s parliament.\n\n\u201cNone of these scandals, even in aggregate, are a body blow for the party,\u201d said one Singapore official with knowledge of PAP thinking. \u201cBut I would say September is definitely being closely watched as a dry run for the general election\u201d in 2025.\n\nThe PAP has put forward one of its most prominent figures, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, a statesman and former deputy leader whose popularity outstrips that of Lee.\n\n\u201cThe PAP will not want to obviously draw a link between the scandals and the election,\u201d said Flinders University\u2019s Barr, suggesting that \u201canything less than 65 per cent of the vote\u201d would be a disappointment given Tharman\u2019s qualifications and popularity.\n\n\u201cThey will pay a lot of attention to the results.\u201d\n\n\u200bLetter in response to this article:\n\nTransparency is \u2018hallmark\u2019 of Singapore\u2019s government\u00a0/\u00a0From TK Lim, Singapore High Commissioner, London SW1, UK", "tag": "singapore?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f203596b-6d03-4f1f-a18b-b8570148c07d"}, {"uuid4": "a4e8b42e-7f30-4066-aec9-ec0339fc671f", "title": "Singapore\u2019s PM defends governance after scandals", "description": "Lee Hsien Loong admits ruling People\u2019s Action party has \u2018taken a hit\u2019 ahead of leadership change", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2023-08-02T12:40:56.353Z", "content": "Singapore\u2019s prime minister has defended its reputation for clean governance after a corruption investigation and an \u201cinappropriate\u201d parliamentary relationship tarnished the city-state\u2019s image just as it prepares for a leadership transition.\n\nLee Hsien Loong addressed Singapore\u2019s episodes of rare political drama in parliament on Wednesday after they made international headlines.\n\nIn the most serious case, transport minister S Iswaran was arrested last month as part of a high-profile corruption investigation that also ensnared billionaire Ong Beng Seng. Both men, who were important figures in Singapore\u2019s successful pitch to be part of the Formula One circuit, have been released on bail.\n\nNeither Ong nor Iswaran have commented publicly on their arrests. Hotel Properties Limited, of which Ong is managing director, said in July he had not been charged with any offence and was providing information to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau about his dealings with the minister.\n\nIn another high-profile case, the Speaker of Singapore\u2019s parliament and a fellow member of the ruling People\u2019s Action party quit as lawmakers last month after revelations that they had an affair.\n\n\u201cWith the investigation into minister Iswaran and the resignations of the house Speaker and an MP, the PAP has taken a hit,\u201d Lee said.\n\nAsked about the independence of the anti-corruption bureau, which sought the prime minister\u2019s permission before launching its probe into Iswaran, Lee said the body had to report to somebody. \u201cIt can\u2019t report to God,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prime minister separately in May asked the bureau to conduct a review after questions were asked in parliament and on social media about the government\u2019s renting of colonial-era homes to two of his cabinet ministers.\n\nFor Singapore, which has traded on its reputation as a clean, stable place to do business throughout its rise to becoming a global finance centre, the episodes are unusually public examples of alleged corruption and unsavoury behaviour within the PAP. The ruling party has governed uninterrupted since independence in 1965 and Singapore\u2019s politicians are among the most highly paid in the world to discourage graft.\n\nThe scandals also come as Lee, son of the founder of modern Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, prepares to hand over power to his deputy Lawrence Wong in what will be only the fourth change of leadership in its history.\n\nLee, who has not said when he will step down, defended the integrity of Singapore\u2019s governance.\n\n\u201cThe way we have handled these incidents shows how seriously the PAP takes our responsibility of governing Singapore, and being accountable to parliament and to Singaporeans.\u201d\n\nHe added that he had asked Iswaran to take a leave of absence and cut the minister\u2019s pay, insisting that corruption cases had occurred in the past and had been dealt with thoroughly and transparently.\n\n\u201cThat is still how the PAP government deals with such cases. It has not changed under my charge; and it won\u2019t under my successor either,\u201d the prime minister said.\n\nBut Lee, who said he first knew of what he has called the \u201cinappropriate\u201d affair between parliamentary Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin and MP Cheng Li Hui\u00a0in 2020, admitted he should have asked them to step down earlier.\n\nTan was asked to resign over the affair after a recording in which he referred in parliament to an opposition politician as a \u201cfucking populist\u201d circulated online.\u00a0The Speaker\u2019s role is meant to be impartial.\n\n\u201cI should have forced the issue sooner,\u201d Lee said of the affair, saying the Speaker\u2019s role meant it raised questions of propriety, but that he had been concerned about the families of the two MPs.\n\nOpposition leader Pritam Singh of the Workers\u2019 party said in response that the PAP had been less than upfront with \u201cpotentially embarrassing issues\u201d and suggested it hire an ethics adviser.\n\nSingapore will next month hold an election for the largely ceremonial role of president, a vote that is being closely watched as a dry run for the general election that must be called by 2025.\n\n\u201cI think the PAP is definitely watching public reactions and sentiment around the presidential race,\u201d said one Singapore-based public policy expert, who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cBut are these scandals going to somehow sink the party at the next election?

Fundraising across private markets is on track this year to fall almost 30 per cent compared with 2022, according to a report released this month by Bain & Co.\n\nGIC said it could increase its private market exposure over the year ahead should the right investments emerge. \u201cThe private market does play to the advantage of a long-term investor like ourselves,\u201d said chief executive Lim Chow Kiat. \u201cIf the market offers more opportunities, certainly we will direct our capital accordingly.\u201d\n\nGIC said the fundraising drought in private markets was an area of opportunity. Many global private equity firms are facing pressure from their investors \u2014 who cannot allocate to new funds until they get some cash back \u2014 to sell parts of their portfolio \u201cat reasonable prices\u201d, Jaensubhakij said.\n\nSome investors have also \u201covercommitted\u201d to private markets and are trying to offload stakes with up to 20 per cent discounts, he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of transactions recently of a reasonably large size.\u201d\n\nGIC said the overall outlook over the next 12 months continued to be challenging, with global interest rates remaining elevated, the chances of a recession relatively high, and \u201cchronic geopolitical risks\u201d.\n\nOver the past year the Singapore state fund\u2019s allocation to the US and Europe increased 1 percentage point each to 38 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, while decreasing to 23 per cent from 25 per cent in Asia excluding Japan. GIC has also pulled back on its investments in China in recent years as the mainland economy ground to a halt during the pandemic and was hit by property market turmoil and regulatory crackdowns.\n\nGIC said China\u2019s economy was unlikely to receive the level of stimulus seen in previous downturns. \u201cEven post-Covid deal flow has been extremely low. We would expect to participate when it normalises\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we have to wait,\u201d said Lim.\n\nThe state fund said it saw opportunities in other parts of Asia as multinational companies diversified their supply chains to cut their reliance on China. \u201cIndia is a great example where we think more modern logistics will have to be built,\u201d said Jaensubhakij, adding that \u201csouth-east Asia should also be a beneficiary of some of these supply-chain moves\u201d.\n\nThis article has been republished to correct the Singapore state fund\u2019s allocation to the US and Europe", "tag": "singapore?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/99e74b43-2e5a-457e-b68a-2a837ea821d8"}, {"uuid4": "80696b61-c1e7-416b-ba57-d50d50e5789c", "title": "What Taylor Swift tells us about Singapore vs Hong Kong", "description": "The rivalry between the two cities has been sharpened by the US singer\u2019s international tour plans", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2023-07-19T23:00:32.152Z", "content": "Two topics prompt impassioned discussion over inflation at expat dinner parties in Singapore at the moment: how much your rent has increased and Taylor Swift.\n\nThe first is met with a round of commiseration or begrudging congratulations, depending on whether you are closer to 100 per cent (most people) or a mere 20 per cent (a lucky few). The second sets off fierce debate on a favourite subject: the merits of Singapore versus Hong Kong.\n\nSwift, like Harry Styles and Coldplay, is performing in Singapore but skipping Hong Kong for next year\u2019s international tour. The American pop star \u2014 who performed in the Chinese special administrative region on a 2011 tour \u2014 is holding six concerts in Singapore, a city-state of over 5mn people. This is more than for Sydney, Tokyo or Mexico City.\n\nThe reasons for Hong Kong\u2019s snub are unclear. Social media is blaming everything from the national security law to the lack of suitable venues. Whatever the reason, these musical choices and rising rents are both indicative of the diverging fortunes of the two cities \u2014 at least in the short term.\n\nHong Kong and Singapore have for years competed for leading financial hub status. But strict pandemic lockdowns, draconian national security legalisation and worsening US-China relations have dulled Hong Kong\u2019s appeal, while Singapore\u2019s low taxes, stable rule of law, and neutrality has made it more enticing for businesses and tourists. Singapore\u2019s total employment numbers now outstrip those in Hong Kong, despite the latter\u2019s larger population.\n\nBut Singapore is dealing with the flip side of that boon: spiralling costs and a limited ability to manage them. \u201cIf two Beyonc\u00e9 concerts apparently caused high inflation in Sweden, what will six Taylor Swift concerts do to Singapore?\u201d grumbled one investment banker based in the city-state to me this week. He has two daughters desperate for VIP tickets.\n\nEven before tickets went on sale, prices for hotels and flights to Singapore were already soaring for March 2 to March 9 2024, when Swift is due to perform. Some three- and four-star hotels are 20 per cent more expensive compared with the week before, while flights from other cities in south-east Asia to Singapore are almost triple the normal price range.\n\nFacing demands for ad hoc school holidays while Swift is in town, Singapore\u2019s education minister, Chan Chun Sing, said on Facebook that granting time off \u201cmay further fuel inflation\u201d.\n\nWhile Hong Kong outpaced Singapore on inflation for most of the 1980s and 1990s, the roles have been reversed. Over the past two years, Singapore\u2019s inflation has been consistently higher than that of its rival. An influx of new residents coupled with delays on new building during the pandemic have pushed rents to record levels. Singapore usurped New York as the city with the highest rental growth at the end of last year, according to Knight Frank, a real estate group.\n\nTiny Singapore can\u2019t compete with other parts of south-east Asia for natural tourist attractions such as beaches or mountains, so it relies heavily on its appeal as a gastronomic hub. But even its lively restaurant scene is grappling with high commercial property rents that are defying a slowdown in other capitals. The manager of my favourite local Italian restaurant is moving to a different, more distant neighbourhood after the landlord doubled his rent.\n\nWhatever the downsides for residents, the healthy rivalry with Hong Kong is a good thing. Competition keeps both cities innovating, launching new financial products and tax incentives to lure business and capital. Hong Kong, determined to recover some of what it has lost, is already attempting to coax back companies, professionals and family offices.\n\nSome friends who moved over from Hong Kong during the pandemic are moving back, though Taylor Swift may make them regret that decision. One, a lawyer with two kids, said she made the decision after her rent was raised by 120 per cent. But she left last week with one request: \u201cI might need a place to stay if I get Taylor Swift tickets. The hotels are too expensive.\u201d\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com", "tag": "singapore?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9196dfe0-4247-44c0-a3d2-fec7ab51179d"}, {"uuid4": "4e7ca0f5-7aa5-42ad-8664-5ca3b51b5769", "title": "Singapore tycoon arrested over graft agency probe involving minister", "description": "Investigation into hotelier and official calls into question city-state\u2019s reputation as clean place to do business", "author": "William Langley", "published_date": "2023-07-14T15:35:58.602Z", "content": "Singapore\u2019s corruption watchdog said it had arrested one of the city-state\u2019s most high-profile property tycoons, expanding a rare operation that has embroiled a minister and dented its reputation as a clean place to do business.\n\nThe Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau confirmed on Friday that both hotelier Ong Beng Seng and transport minister S Iswaran had been arrested on Wednesday before being released on bail.

That compared with it being worth a record S$403bn in 2022. A S$7bn loss was driven by mark-to-market accounting.\n\nThe Asian investor, which has two-thirds of its portfolio in the region and has backed some of the world\u2019s biggest start-ups from Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Group in China to San Francisco and Dublin-based payments processing group Stripe, reported a 5.07 per cent drop in total shareholder returns.

The group slowed its investment pace for the period, calling it \u201cthe most challenging year for markets over the last decade\u201d.\n\nThe results underline the struggle of global investors to adapt to a new era of higher interest rates.

Peak XV is also planning to open a US office, the company said.\n\nA number of executives from HongShan have travelled to Singapore in the past six months, the rival fund director added. The new office will accommodate at least two members of its investment team.\n\nThe China unit, which is managed by renowned investor Neil Shen, who led early investments in Alibaba and TikTok owner ByteDance, has told people in Singapore meetings that it would initially look to support its existing Chinese founders who had international businesses in the city-state. However, it also expressed interest in investing in start-ups.\n\nOne person who had spoken to HongShan executives in Singapore said it could tap into growing demand from Chinese founders to set up operations there and rebrand themselves as Singapore-based, a move that has been dubbed \u201cSingapore-washing\u201d. The city-state\u2019s neutrality is appealing as the US steps up its scrutiny of outbound capital to China.\n\nHongShan\u2019s interest in south-east Asia comes at a time when some of Peak XV\u2019s portfolio companies are facing difficulties.\n\nThe ecommerce group Zilingo went into liquidation in January after complaints of financial irregularities and the high-profile firing of its co-founder and chief executive.\n\nEducational technology provider Byju\u2019s, once India\u2019s most valuable start-up, lost that position after investors wrote down the value of their stakes. Last month, its auditor resigned over a lack of information provided for its accounts, and the company suffered a series of high-profile board departures, including Peak XV\u2019s representative.\n\nHongShan told the Financial Times it had a \u201cstrong foundation of trust\u201d with PeakXV and there would be opportunities for both teams to collaborate. \u201cHongShan\u2019s focus continues to be partnering with Chinese founders and supporting them on their globalisation journeys,\u201d it said.\n\nPeak XV said: \u201cThe opportunities for collaboration [with HongShan] are far greater than the scope for competition.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e007ce22-9763-4c9b-969f-ff4e97f320e1"}, {"uuid4": "226196b8-8fc3-4ad2-87ff-99c27aa9cc03", "title": "Who\u2019s behind all those weird product ads on Twitter?", "description": "And has one of the biggest advertisers just been nuked?", "author": "Bryce Elder", "published_date": "2023-07-07T13:45:43.214Z", "content": "Something big just happened in the world of Twitter advertising.\n\nFor quite some time, the internet\u2019s town square has been clogged with adverts for pet products, household doodahs, gadgets and garden ornaments, as if the Betterware Catalogue had been reinvented by Wish. The ads all use the same template: a promoted tweet from a blue-tick account, a speeded-up video, and a link to an identikit shopfront badged something like Zotu, Dulo or Loza.\n\nThe frequency with which these ads appeared has caused Twitter users quite a lot of irritation\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\n\n.\u2009.\u2009. with the community\u2019s \u201cadded context\u201d feature being used to raise concerns about the quality and legal status of some products:\n\nAs it happens, Alphaville was tracking several dozen of these ad accounts. And in the past few hours, every single one was suspended.\n\nTo be clear, there are a lot of dropshipper ads on social media. The specific accounts we\u2019re referring to were promoting a fleet of commerce sites \u2014 Tace, Vore, Toba \u2014 that are aesthetically and functionally identical. They all use the same build of WordPress and they all rely on Woocommerce, an open-source plugin for small merchants.\n\nAnother repeated theme among these ecommerce sites is unlikely-sounding operating addresses. The head office of Sene, for example, is the site of what was once The Square restaurant in Mayfair:\n\n.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and Kena appears to operate out of some super-prime real estate:\n\nHaving a bogus business address on an ecommerce website is not allowed, at least in the UK. The Advertising Standards Authority requires ads targeting UK consumers to be accurate and not contain any misleading information, including about where the operator is based. For example, in 2019 the ASA banned an ad for Wandsworth Plumbers after finding no evidence that it had a permanent base in Wandsworth.\n\nAn ASA spokesman said that without an investigation he couldn\u2019t say whether any of the Twitter ads would be subject to its regulation.\n\nSo who\u2019s really behind the sites? Our test orders through different shopfronts all resolved to the same company, a Singapore-registered dropshipping agent called Poxdo.\n\nMuch of the text on Poxdo\u2019s website is identical to other, seemingly unrelated websites so it\u2019s tricky to know what to trust. The contact page lists an address in downtown Singapore, within the Bugis Cube shopping centre, and mentions a warehouse in Yiwu, in the Zhejiang province of China.\n\nYiwu, \u201cthe world\u2019s largest wholesale market for small manufactured goods\u201d, was recently profiled by our colleagues on MainFT:\n\nPublic documents filed at Singapore\u2019s corporate registry show Poxdo PTE Ltd was established in May 2020 and name two directors: Lee Ming Chung, a citizen of Singapore, and Nguyen Dac Manh of Ha Noi, Vietnam.\n\nOur efforts over several weeks to contact either director proved unsuccessful. Emails direct to Poxdo also went unanswered. Company secretary Thung Sai Fun of Ace Global Accountants and Auditors, when contacted on LinkedIn, did not respond to our requests for information about Poxdo and has since switched her profile to private.\n\nUnder Singapore law, a company must have at least one resident director on its board at all times. Foreigners setting up Singapore companies often recruit a local resident to be a passive, nominee director. Lee Ming Sung is a director of more than 60 disparate Singapore-incorporated companies and a shareholder of none, his registry record shows. (We\u2019re including the original documents here because while all filings are public, the Singapore government\u2019s BizFile service charges up to $50 per download request.)\n\nThe given address on the registration form for Nguyen Dac Manh, Poxdo\u2019s other director and 100 per cent shareholder, is for an area of Hanoi rather than a residence or a specific street. Over the past two weeks we have reached out to numerous people with that name \u2014 there\u2019s a Nguyen Dac Manh who promotes Vietnam real estate, for example, and a Nguyen Dac Manh who appears in promotional videos for Lazada, the Singapore-based ecommerce group. So far, none has responded.\n\nAn odd, possibly irrelevant tangent can be found buried on Poxdo\u2019s website. As well as the visible pages detailing the company\u2019s operations, there\u2019s the unused framework of a WordPress- and WooCommerce-based storefront lying dormant in the background. Among its public but unlisted sections are template \u201cauthor\u201d and \u201cblog\u201d pages with holder posts credited to \u201cMaximus Brainsby\u201d. (The same framework appears elsewhere on the ecommerce web, such as for the Beeco storefront.)\n\nMaximus Brainsby Ltd was the name of a company incorporated in the UK in 2019 by a Vietnamese resident, Tuan Hoang Anh, and struck off in 2021. The name also appears on a messageboard for users of Shopify, in a thread complaining about traffic received from a product research tool called Pexgle. One poster quotes an email they say was signed \u201cMaximus Brainsby, Co-Founder, Pexgle.\u201d\n\nVietnam-based Pexgle advertises itself as an \u201call-in-one hunt winning products and ads toolkit for dropshippers and ecommerce entrepreneurs\u201d. We\u2019ve asked Pexgle and everyone we could find named Tuan Hoang Anh about dropshipping and Twitter ads; none has yet responded.

However, it said it had not found evidence of wilful misconduct in its investigation.\n\nOnce the darling of Germany\u2019s fintech sector, Wirecard collapsed in 2020 after admitting that about \u20ac1.9bn in cash was missing from its accounts.\n\nThree of Wirecard\u2019s most senior former executives have been on trial in Munich since December on charges of fraud, embezzlement and accounting and market manipulation. They include ex-chief executive Markus Braun, who denies wrongdoing.\n\nSingapore was central to the fraud, with many central figures in the scandal based in the Asian financial hub. On Tuesday, a state court handed down prison sentences to two former senior Wirecard finance executives, the first criminal convictions related to the collapse of the German payments group.\n\nDBS, Singapore\u2019s biggest bank, received the largest fine on Wednesday of S$2.6mn (US$1.9mn). The company said it accepted the MAS decision on lapses.\n\n\u201cWhile we detected and acted upon some of [the] activities through transaction monitoring and customer due diligence \u2014 and ultimately exited all relevant entities \u2014 we were unable to unravel the scheme in its entirety,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe acknowledge that we could have done better.\u201d\n\nCiti, which was handed a S$400,000 penalty, said: \u201cThe case dates back to before June 2020 and since then we have taken steps to strengthen our know your customer process.\u201d\n\nSwiss Life, which was given a S$200,000 fine, said it had co-operated with authorities and that it had since implemented additional measures to \u201cdetect client misconduct more effectively\u201d.\n\nOCBC, which received a fine of S$600,000, said one of its business banking customers was implicated in the Wirecard case. The bank had \u201cenhanced\u201d its\u00a0transaction monitoring, due diligence and know-your-customer processes in the past few years, it added.\n\nThe fines come ahead of the Singapore trial scheduled to start next month of James Henry O\u2019Sullivan, another figure alleged to have played a central role in the Wirecard scandal. While O\u2019Sullivan has not been charged in Germany, prosecutors in the Munich trial claim that companies the Englishman controlled extracted hundreds of millions of euros from the payments company before it crashed into insolvency.\n\nIn Singapore, O\u2019Sullivan faces charges of abetting the falsification of documents, including papers that helped persuade Wirecard\u2019s auditors at EY that the company had extensive cash reserves until it was forced to announce that \u20ac1.9bn recorded in its accounts did not exist.

The US is also prime hunting ground for artificial intelligence companies as the industry rapidly expands.\n\nIt also comes despite a collapse in funding for venture capital groups in the US and falling valuations for private companies. That slowdown could impact GIC\u2019s investment levels over 2023, though interest in the US has remained high this year, the partner said.\n\nBut the US remains one of the biggest destinations for capital, especially in tech, as global investors rethink their strategy in China over concerns including geopolitical tensions with the US, an economic slowdown and a crackdown on business.\n\nGIC struck 63 deals involving US-based private companies including in technology, healthcare and property in 2022 and 2021, compared with 39 in 2019 and 2018, according to data by Refinitiv.\n\nBy comparison, ITjuzi, a data provider that monitors inflows to China, recorded two direct investments in Chinese companies by GIC last year, down from 16 in 2021.\n\nGIC declined to comment but has previously said it maintains significant exposure to large markets including China.\n\nA venture capitalist with offices in Silicon Valley said the company had held talks with GIC about raising its commitments to US funds, including in the secondary market. The latter is where private stakes in start-ups and VC funds change hands.\n\nGIC \u201cindicated they were looking to ramp up hiring of investment specialists\u201d, the person added. GIC is advertising 18 jobs in the US, according to LinkedIn. One post is for a specialist in the private equity secondary market as well as other senior roles in equities, fixed-income and portfolio management.\n\nGlobal investors who have relied on growth in China face a challenge finding alternatives. India and other emerging markets including Indonesia have not been able to match the mainland market in size and sophistication, even though their economic growth is higher than in developed markets including the US.\n\n\u201cBut there are only so many bets you can make in places like India and Indonesia. The US has much to offer across biotech, utilities, consumer companies and real estate,\u201d said one Asia-based asset manager and adviser who spoke to GIC about its strategy. \u201cHowever, there has been some question over tech valuations more recently which could affect the strategy.\u201d\n\nThe US is GIC\u2019s biggest market, making up 37 per cent of its portfolio according to its 2022 report, compared with 34 per cent in 2021. It does not break down its Asian portfolio, which represented 25 per cent of its holdings in 2022, excluding Japan. Its private market exposure has grown to 17 per cent from 12 per cent between 2022 and 2019.\n\nGIC, which has offices in San Francisco and New York, in April increased its stake in Nasdaq-listed US-Israeli fintech Pagaya, which uses AI to manage assets for financial institutions.\n\nGIC and Singapore\u2019s other state investor Temasek became investors in Stripe, the San Francisco- and Dublin-based payments processing group, in March.

He linked the wave of developer defaults to a series of policies begun in 2021 to bring down leverage in the financial system.\n\nSingapore government-backed CapitaLand Investment highlighted the foreign interest in distressed Chinese properties in February when it raised a 1.1bn Singapore dollar ($820mn) fund to hunt for bargains in the Chinese commercial property sector.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainties in the market in the last two years have brought forth many opportunities, particularly in the special situations space, as developers continue to face [a] credit crunch,\u201d Simon Treacy, chief executive of private equity real estate at CapitaLand, told Nikkei Asia in May.\n\nOne of the biggest distressed deals on the mainland came in October when CapitaLand agreed to pay Rmb2.04bn ($290mn) for a Beijing office building sold at auction after a default by Te Er Te, a property management company owned by Dalian-based developer Yongjia Group, court records show. The price represented a 30 per cent discount from its 2021 valuation.\n\nIn January, a Singapore-headquartered private equity manager with about $7bn of assets under management signed a deal with a Taiwanese manufacturer to buy a bankrupt logistics facility in China, said an executive with the buyer who asked not be named because he is not authorised to speak with the media.\n\n\u201cWe go after these manufacturers who have been hurting,\u201d the executive said. \u201cSo if we look at where most of the pain is, we will continue to see select opportunities to refurbish [and] take over\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009underutilised or even bankrupt manufacturers.\u201d\n\nSome western investors, including Brookfield Asset Management and Pictet Wealth Management, have also shown interest in such deals.

But to Singapore, carbon markets are above all an opportunity: the Asian city-state is betting big on an area of finance that it thinks can only grow as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy.\n\nIn its race with Tokyo and Hong Kong to be the region\u2019s premier business hub, Singapore wants to become the preferred financial centre for governments and businesses that inevitably need to interact with the global carbon market to cut their emissions.\n\nIts ambitions encompass both the largely unregulated international voluntary carbon market as well as the compliance carbon market \u2014 which is seen by governments as crucial to achieving carbon reduction targets.\n\nIn 2019, Singapore became the first country in south-east Asia to put a price on carbon \u2014 which companies will next year be able to offset by buying carbon credits. Last year, it went on to become the first in the region to launch a carbon exchange. It has also signed a string of deals with developing countries on carbon credit collaboration.\n\nMuch of Singapore\u2019s ambition is born of necessity. With its 5.5mn population and tiny size, it has no natural resources of its own. But its central position in Asia allows it to serve as a bridge between established carbon markets in the west and emerging markets in the region. It can facilitate the flow of carbon credits and investments and, thereby, potentially accelerate its own emissions reduction plans.\n\n\u201cFor a number of years now, Singapore has had ambitions in relation to hosting financial markets but, in particular, carbon markets,\u201d says Pedro Barata, associate vice-president of carbon markets for the Environmental Defense Fund, a US non-profit organisation. \u201cIt wants to play a central role in terms of carbon trading in the region. Nobody else in Asia, to my knowledge, is trying to create similar infrastructure like Singapore.\u201d\n\nA large part of that ambition is focused on voluntary carbon trading \u2014 a system that allows the buying and selling of carbon credits internationally to incentivise and regulate emissions reductions.\n\nIf Singapore can harness the opportunity, it stands to benefit enormously from a market that could be worth $50bn by 2030, according to the consultancy McKinsey.\n\nBut it is a system that has been beset by controversies in recent months. Critics say it allows companies to continue polluting without materially contributing to reducing their emissions.\n\nCarbon offsets were even described as an \u201coxymoron\u201d by the independent Carbon Market Watch group, given the example of tree planting in China to offset the emissions generated by Shell in producing gas that was marketed as \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d \u2014 as first reported in the FT.\n\nIn the past 18 months, such schemes have proliferated, many unverified. The pledges for carbon removal through tree planting, for example, would require a land area the size of the US, scientific studies have concluded. Furthermore, forests in the US that generated offsets bought by companies including BP and Microsoft were burnt in summer fires, calling into question their value.\n\n\u201cIt is an interesting time to be going all in on carbon trading, but their reputation is good and you would probably trust an exchange in Singapore over say, Malaysia, Thailand or even Hong Kong,\u201d says one Singapore-based carbon trader, who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nSingapore\u2019s government has acknowledged the challenge of ensuring that carbon credits uphold high environmental integrity standards. In February, it said that this year it would publish a \u201cwhite list\u201d of credits that would be acceptable for offsetting Singapore companies\u2019 taxable carbon emissions. This list will include approved host countries, programmes and methodologies.\n\n\u201cWe know this market is missing trust\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Singapore has the right pedigree,\u201d says Mikkel Larsen, chief executive of Climate Impact X, a global exchange and marketplace for carbon credits based in Singapore. \u201cIt has the basic infrastructure and experience with creating new markets.\u201d\n\nJointly established by DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered and state investor Temasek, CIX launched its first nature-based standardised contract this month. The credits covered by the contract are generated through schemes that protect forests that would otherwise be destroyed or degraded, it says. Eligible projects include rainforests and biodiversity reserves in Asia, Africa and South America.\n\n\u201cSingapore\u2019s emissions are large for a country of its size and it has no real means of getting to net zero,\u201d says Vidur Nayar, head of Asia-Pacific environmental trading at Hartree Partners, a global energy and commodities trading group. \u201cBut the commodity traders are all here and so, naturally, you are seeing growth in carbon trading, too.\u201d\n\nGiving added heft to Singapore\u2019s push is some good old-fashioned incentivising. The city-state will allow companies to use high-quality international carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable greenhouse gas emissions from 2024. While relatively low now, at S$5 per tonne, the tax will rise to S$25 per tonne in 2024, and S$45 from 2026.\n\nVoluntary markets are only part of Singapore\u2019s strategy, however. The country also has its sights set on compliance markets, which are established by governments as a means of cutting national emissions through mandatory cap and trade schemes. These are mechanisms where carbon emitters buy or sell credits based on whether they exceed or undershoot emissions limits set by the government.\n\nAsia is one of the biggest growth areas for compliance markets: both South Korea and, more recently, China have established emissions trading schemes, and Indonesia and India will soon follow.\n\nUnder Article 6 of the 2015 Paris climate accord \u2014 the UN agreement to limit global warming to 2C, and preferably 1.5C, above pre-industrial levels \u2014 countries can also co-operate to share the benefits of emissions reduction schemes, in order to hit their national decarbonisation targets.\n\nIn May, Singapore signed a memorandum of understanding with Bhutan to co-operate on carbon credits under the terms of Article 6.\n\nThis deal was the 10th such MoU: other nations that have signed up with Singapore include Colombia, Kenya, Peru and Vietnam.\n\nExperts say that companies operating in multiple countries will prefer a central, trusted venue for trading the credits that compliance schemes create \u2014 and Singapore wants to be that venue.\n\n\u201cIt is Singapore saying\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. we will be your outlet, we will be your go-to financial centre for trading these, we will assist you with those trades, including getting the recognition of international standards,\u201d says Barata from the Environmental Defense Fund.", "tag": "singapore?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1b1af3cc-6081-4d4f-b4b4-63940ff9482f"}, {"uuid4": "bb51e312-b79c-417c-84a5-59fdabd17f7a", "title": "Singapore\u2019s listing ambitions hit by woes of data centre operator ", "description": "As key customers of Digital Core REIT have stumbled, questions over disclosure have arisen", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2023-06-13T23:01:06.089Z", "content": "Singapore is thriving as an Asian finance hub. Record amounts of capital are flowing into the city-state from China, south-east Asia, the US and elsewhere. Not only did Singapore gain from the closure of rival Hong Kong during the pandemic but the nation has benefited from a more neutral approach in a world marked by geopolitical polarisation.\n\nBut it has struggled with its ambitions for a key part of its finance hub strategy \u2014 to develop a thriving stock market with a pipeline of new equity listings.\u00a0Monthly delistings often outnumber new companies and the number of quoted companies has fallen from 720 at the start of 2020 to 645 as of April. The Straits Times index for the market has essentially flatlined over the past five years, excluding a Covid-related dip and recovery.\n\nAnd the market has been delivered a fresh blow by the dismal performance of a high-profile listing of a foreign business, Digital Core REIT. It is not just a matter of a steep share price decline. The circumstances of the real estate investment trust\u2019s problems raise questions over the level of disclosure required on the market.\n\nThe owner of data centres in the US, Toronto and Frankfurt was spun out of US property group Digital Realty and was Singapore\u2019s biggest equity listing by funds raised of the past five years and the fourth largest over the past decade, according to Dealogic. The company\u2019s shares have dropped 35 per cent from the offer price and 60 per cent from an early 2022 high.\n\nA key factor in that slide has been problems with two major tenants. Earlier this month, data centre operator Cyxtera, reported to be Digital Core REIT\u2019s second-biggest customer, went bankrupt. The company has accounted for\u00a0about\u00a022 per cent of the trust\u2019s rental revenue income.\n\nCyxtera\u2019s troubles have been documented by the media since at least the beginning of this year. But until recently investors would have not known about them by reading only the disclosures by Digital Core REIT, or even that it was a very big customer of the trust. According to management, the Singapore-listed group is typically bound by confidentiality provisions in lease agreements.\n\nNor was the identity of the trust\u2019s reportedly fifth-largest customer, Sungard, disclosed at the time of the IPO. Sungard went bankrupt for a second time in April 2022 \u2014 just four months after Digital Core REIT\u2019s IPO. The trust informed investors of the bankruptcy of its fifth-biggest tenant 10 days after Sungard had filed in the US. It did not mention Sungard, which had accounted for about 7 per cent of the trust\u2019s rental revenue, by name.\n\nIt was not until April that there was any mention of the troubles facing Cyxtera, when the trust released responses to shareholder questions. Cyxtera filed for bankruptcy protection two months later on June 4. This time the failure was disclosed the next day, though Cyxtera was still not mentioned by name.\n\nUnder Singapore\u2019s continuous disclosure rules, companies have to disclose information that would be likely to materially affect the price or value of their securities. The exception is if the information is confidential, prepared for internal management purposes or concerns an incomplete negotiation. The Singapore Exchange says: \u201cWe have been assessing the information flow and promptness of disclosures bearing in mind the impact on the Reit\u2019s financials.\u201d\n\nMak Yuen Teen, a professor at the National University of Singapore, says if Digital Core REIT had been listed in the US, some of its \u201ctardy disclosures\u201d might have seen investors \u201ccome after them\u201d.\n\nA Digital Core REIT spokesperson said: \u201cUpon learning that its second-largest customer had filed for bankruptcy, Digital Core REIT immediately requested a trading halt and promptly provided robust and timely disclosures\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009In general, we believe it is inappropriate to speculate or comment on any customer\u2019s financial condition or course of action.\u201d The company earlier told shareholders it expected \u201cminimal impact\u201d from the bankruptcy.\n\nBut the poor performance of Digital Core REIT\u2019s share price speaks to the reduced confidence in the company\u2019s prospects and the assets chosen for its portfolio. In seeking to attract more listings, it seems fair to ask: did Singapore get a poor deal with Digital Core REIT? The city-state has developed into something of a hub for Reits but as a centre for stock exchange listings, it has not matched its business achievements elsewhere. The woes of Digital Core REIT underline the importance of quality in listing candidates and strong regulation to ensure market integrity if it wants to do better.\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com", "tag": "singapore?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5979ec8b-f956-4e8d-ab87-7817cbe7f45a"}, {"uuid4": "e604b828-52fa-451f-8465-532279e3d0a9", "title": "CSOP AM ETF aims to profit from shift away from China factories", "description": "The fund will focus on India and south-east Asian retail as well as technology, cars and component producers ", "author": "Ernest Chan", "published_date": "2023-06-12T04:00:49.330Z", "content": "CSOP Asset Management is gearing up to launch what it claims will be Singapore\u2019s first exchange traded fund focusing on the technology industry across south-east Asia and India.\n\nThe fund firm is aiming to raise up to $30mn by June 20, when the ETF will officially list on the Singapore bourse, with a longer-term goal of hitting $100mn in assets within the first year.\n\nThe CSOP iEdge Southeast Asia+ TECH Index ETF will be listed on the Singapore Exchange on June 20. The fund will track the iEdge Southeast Asia+ TECH Index, which provides exposure to 30 tech firms across six south-east Asian markets and India across information technology, software, retail, car manufacturing, and electronic components and manufacturing.\n\nJust under 28 per cent of the portfolio is in electronics components and manufacturing, followed by a 19 per cent allocation to software and consulting companies and 16 per cent to miscellaneous retail.\n\nUS-listed companies with origins in south-east Asia and India make up the largest portion by market with a weighting of 43 per cent, followed by 18 per cent for Thailand, 15 per cent for Indonesia, 12 per cent for Singapore and 11 per cent for Malaysia.\n\nWang Yi, Hong Kong-based head of quantitative investment at CSOP AM, said a key factor behind the creation of the ETF was growing client demand for allocations to south-east Asia.\n\nThe challenge for investors in accessing the region is the fact that it is \u201ca little fragmented\u201d and there is no \u201caggregate portfolio they can easily access\u201d, Wang argued.\n\nThe ETF invests in both locally listed companies, as well as the US stocks of local companies via American depositary receipts, which is how the ETF gets exposure to Indian companies, he explained.\n\nThe Hong Kong-based asset manager, which entered the Singapore market in 2019, believes the local tech sector is set to benefit from a combination of strong regional economic growth, a growing middle class, and a shift in industrial manufacturing capabilities away from China and into south-east and south Asia.\n\nExports from south-east Asia rose from $474bn in 2003 to $1.713tn in 2021, the firm noted, citing research from the Observatory of Economic Complexity, with much of this growth coming from the tech sector.\n\nThe firm said that south-east Asia was also expected to have 140mn new consumers by 2030, with the middle-classes expected to account for just under 70 per cent of the total regional population in the same period, citing World Economic Forum data.\n\nThe digital economy sector in the region grew at a compound annual growth rate of 24 per cent between 2019 and 2022 as well, with India seeing a compound annual growth rate of 16 per cent in the same period, according to research from Google, Temasek and Bain & Company.\n\nThe region should also benefit from what the firm refers to as the \u201cfifth round of industrial relocation\u201d, where manufacturing capabilities are now shifting from China to south-east Asia, after earlier shifts from the UK to the US, the US to Japan, Japan to the so-called four tigers of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, and from the four tigers to China.\n\nAs more manufacturing and industrial facilities relocate to the region, CSOP AM anticipates income to grow, leading to more growth opportunities for regional tech companies and service providers, who should benefit as local consumers spend more on tech and tech services such as ride-sharing applications, Wang said.\n\nLocally listed ETF assets in Singapore shrunk slightly in the first four months of this year, however, falling from $8.17bn at the end of 2022 to $8.03bn by the end of April, according to Singapore Exchange data \u2014 far below the $9.19bn figure at the end of 2021.\n\nThis latest ETF could also potentially be on the table to be cross-listed into the Chinese market via the recently announced ETF scheme between the Singapore Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange, Wang said.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

By winning enough liquidity from international carbon traders, it hopes to become a global price setter for carbon credits and lay the groundwork for an eventual futures market.\n\nCIX, a joint venture among Singapore Exchange, state investor Temasek and banks DBS and Standard Chartered, said the initial price established for its physical carbon credits was $5.36 per tonne, about four times that for a similar nature-based contract at CBL, the world\u2019s leading carbon exchange. Volumes on Wednesday were small as expected.\n\nVoluntary carbon trading is a system that directs financing to climate-related projects. In buying carbon credits \u2014 certificates that represent quantities of greenhouse gases kept out of the air or removed from it \u2014 companies can offset their own emissions. The credits come from projects around the world that protect and support nature.\n\nThe industry is expected to grow as countries transition to low-carbon economies. A key challenge in carbon offsetting is how to price the credits, which is behind the efforts to launch spot and futures markets.\n\nBut a series of scandals related to credits linked to projects of questionable quality has dented enthusiasm among traders and hit volumes.\n\nThis has led to low prices on established exchanges, with CBL\u2019s credits trading at about $1.15 on the exchange. That value is much less than the $5-$10 price range companies believe is their fair value, discouraging trade.\n\nCIX\u2019s experiment has been to provide a contract with fewer but higher-quality projects to compete with CBL and CME. It hopes to eventually establish stable trading volumes.\n\n\u201cIt would be wrong to say [the scandals] have not put a dent in the market. Right now the market is a little bit more choppy than it was before\u201d said Mikkel Larsen, chief executive at CIX.\n\n\u201cWe could have waited for better times, but we decided not to. Building a carbon hub is not something you do overnight. If Singapore stopped and started every time something pushes against this, they will never get there.\u201d\n\nThe credits covered by the contract are generated through schemes that protect forests which would otherwise be destroyed or degraded, according to CIX. The basket of 11 projects include rainforests and biodiversity reserves in Asia, Africa and South America.\n\n\u201cBy excluding projects traders don\u2019t like or trust, CIX are basically trying to create the Brent or similar index for carbon that sets a better benchmark,\u201d said one carbon trader based in Singapore. Brent is the world\u2019s most important crude oil benchmark.\n\nSingapore has another carbon exchange called AirCarbon, a blockchain-based platform, but it has not had much traction with traders.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nAirCarbon \u2018sees strong interest from traders\u2019\u00a0/\u00a0From Thomas McMahon and William Pazos, Co-Founders, ACX, Singapore", "tag": "singapore?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7bef95a2-3165-416e-a701-344c4bb6c438"}, {"uuid4": "5e1a8385-56ac-45c6-b508-f3bb209868fc", "title": "How Singapore Airlines soared while regional rival Cathay Pacific stalled", "description": "Post-pandemic success comes as Hong Kong carrier struggles to recover", "author": "Primrose Riordan", "published_date": "2023-05-31T01:30:39.380Z", "content": "Just as Singapore Airlines was giving employees an eight-month salary bonus after record profits, Hong Kong was giving away more than 4,400 free tickets for regional rival Cathay Pacific as the city sought to encourage visitors to return.\n\nShares of Singapore Airlines have soared to their highest levels in more than three years after the national carrier made clear the strength of its post-coronavirus pandemic recovery with an annual profit of S$2.16bn ($1.6bn) for the year ending in March.\n\nIn stark contrast, shares in Hong Kong-listed Cathay Pacific have dropped nearly 40 per cent from a high in April 2019. In March, the airline unveiled a HK$6.5bn ($830mn) loss for 2022 and shares have remained flat since.\n\nTheir financial divergence reflects the rise of Singapore, one of the first countries in Asia to reopen its borders after the pandemic, and the burnishing of its status as a business hub. Hong Kong, on the other hand, remained largely closed off to travel until late last year, losing its status as the region\u2019s busiest airport to Singapore in 2022. Its slow reopening has affected Cathay Pacific, which is also reeling from labour shortages.\n\n\u201cSingapore was ahead of everyone last year in Asia-Pacific [with the reopening],\u201d said Brendan Sobie, an independent aviation analyst based in Singapore. \u201cThey benefited from that tremendously.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Cathay\u2019s first financial year after reopening will look like Singapore\u2019s,\u201d he added. \u201cThat honeymoon period caused by supply and demand imbalance is waning \u2014 they\u2019ve largely missed out on those market conditions.\u201d\n\nHong Kong tourism is still very early in its recovery, which is reflected in the carrier numbers. Singapore Airlines has reached nearly 80 per cent of pre-pandemic passenger capacity, while Cathay Pacific is still at less than 50 per cent.\n\nSingapore Airlines and its wholly owned budget airline Scoot carried 2.7mn passengers in April, an 85 per cent year-on-year increase and just under the 3.1mn passengers they flew in the same month in 2019. Cathay Pacific carried 1.4mn passengers in April 2023, about 44 per cent of the number in April 2019.\n\nAt its annual meeting this month, Cathay\u2019s chief executive Ronald Lam said the airline was unlikely to exceed 70 per cent of pre-Covid passenger capacity before the end of this year, citing labour constraints.\n\nAn average of 10 to 15 senior pilots have quit Cathay Pacific each month this year, said the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association, down from about 30 to 50 each month in the second half of last year.\n\nThe airline \u2014 which had a crew of 3,800 pilots in late 2019 \u2014 lost more than 1,800 pilots over the past three years, according to union chair Paul Weatherilt, but has only recruited about 400 new pilots. After seeing wage cuts of up to 40 per cent in 2020, pilots remain disgruntled, the union said.\n\nCathay Pacific said the\u00a0\u201cattrition rate has normalised across all staff groups\u201d including pilots, adding that crew base pay has risen by 3.3 per cent from the beginning of this year.\n\n\u201cBesides Hong Kong having a later reopening timeline than other aviation hubs, Cathay\u2019s slower recovery pace reflects [its] ongoing challenges with supply constraints across the aviation ecosystem\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[such as] availability of certified manpower,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Karen Li wrote in a note in March.\n\nWith wages now calculated by flight time, Hong Kong aviation officials have advised Cathay that some of their pilots have been taxiing on the runway at \u201cconsiderably slower speeds\u201d, according to an internal Cathay memo seen by the Financial Times.\n\nIn a further sign of crisis, Cathay fired three cabin crew after a clip accusing them of joking about a Mandarin Chinese-speaking customer\u2019s English language ability went viral. Chief executive Lam said it had caused \u201csignificant damage to the image of Hong Kong and Cathay\u201d. But Cathay\u2019s flight attendants\u2019 union hit back, complaining of low morale, increased workload and lower salaries.\n\nSingapore Airlines, on the other hand, told local media it had brought back most of the 3,000-plus pilots \u2014 many of whom had been furloughed \u2014 by the middle of last year. Only a \u201cvery small number\u201d left during the pandemic, management said at the time.\n\nSingapore Airlines historically does not provide much detail on its staff, citing commercial reasons. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince the pandemic, Singapore has gained more transit traffic that traditionally went through Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cSingapore Airlines [did] well last year because they functioned as the only realistic transit hub in all of Asia,\u201d a senior Asian airline executive said. Cathay reported a 68 per cent drop in sales originating from the Americas to $572mn in 2022 compared with 2019. Singapore Airlines had a 46 per cent increase in sales originating from the Americas to $1.1bn in the 12 months to the end of March this year, compared with the 12 months to the end of March 2020.\n\nThe booming market conditions that boosted Singapore Airlines\u2019 bottom line are not expected to last. And Hong Kong is throwing billions of dollars towards luring back international business and tourists, such as with its recent Cathay campaign.\n\n\u201cWe are still in a dynamic period, and many of us believe most of the benefits have been temporary,\u201d said one Singapore Airlines executive. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we will see a profit like that again.

Is it finally here?", "author": "Maria Shollenbarger", "published_date": "2023-05-17T04:01:00.992Z", "content": "It feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: back in Singapore, back to unpacking the topic of whether the buttoned-up country might be poised to emerge as Asia\u2019s new capital of cool. Singapore\u2019s presumptive rise as a destination in its own right \u2013 worth travelling for, rather than just transiting through \u2013 has been touted more than once in the past 15-odd years. In 2009, the catalyst was the city hosting an F1 night race and a concert, F1 Rocks, with Nobu Matsuhisa dispatching nigiri to VIPs in the pit and Beyonc\u00e9 as a headline act. In 2013 it was a critical mass of chefs, mixologists and cultural venues with international talent behind them; in 2017, a similar set of addresses, all created by Singaporeans. Each time there was a groundswell of local enthusiasm, with creative types and Tourism Board officials labouring to lend substance to the \u201cSingabore no more!\u201d claim. And each time, out on the still-pretty-snoozy Singapore street, it was, if not quite failure to launch, also never quite the zeitgeist combustion everyone hoped for.\n\nNow there\u2019s renewed speculation that this staid island nation of 5.5 million might be having a(nother?) moment; but this time spurred in part by outside forces \u2013 regional business shifts and the geopolitical machinations of Singapore\u2019s powerful neighbour, resulting in influxes of people, and wealth, from both Hong Kong and mainland China. FT reports estimate that more than 800 family offices have been established since the end of 2021; 2022-23 saw around 500 Chinese family offices, private-equity firms and wealth managers open or redomicile. (Singapore has already long been a base for UHNW residents from neighbouring Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.) Meta, Google and Apple all have their Asia-Pacific HQs here; some Hong Kong-based banks are relocating senior staff; blockchain and tech start-ups abound. The new expats \u2013 and the scads of capital they bring, along with the odd pearl-pink Bentley \u2013 are a favourite topic of conversation. (Likewise the city\u2019s skyrocketing rents: friends talk of being pushed out of central neighbourhoods by rent hikes, while newly arrived mainlanders sign $100,000-a-month leases on penthouse flats and the city\u2019s sought-after black-and-white colonial houses. In April, the government announced it would double its tax on private property purchases by foreigners to 60 per cent, in a move to cool a housing boom that has in part been driven by buyers from mainland China.)\n\nDo the decoupling and diversification up there really account for cultural shifts down here? Culture in general, whether grassroots or institutional, is still one of Singapore\u2019s more persistent challenges. The two factors collided in January at the inauguration of ART SG, the contemporary fair created by The Art Assembly, the team behind Art HK (now Art Basel Hong Kong). More than 160 galleries \u2013 both big names (Gagosian, Lehmann Maupin, White Cube, David Zwirner) and boutique stars such as the Paris-founded Almine Rech and Belgian-based Xavier Hufkens \u2013 convened at Marina Bay Sands Expo & Convention Centre, with an estimated 43,000 international art enthusiasts and powerhouse regional collectors. \u201cYou had some heavy-hitting galleries, which is a good indication of their belief in the market,\u201d says Singaporean art adviser Talenia Phua Gajardo, whose company, The Artling, has both corporate and private clients across the Asia-Pacific region. \u201cThey\u2019re not unrealistic; they know it\u2019s not \u2018do a booth and they will come\u2019 \u2013 they need time to build networks. The goal was to position Singapore as a hub for connecting with regional collectors, and [those collectors] were all here. And the stuff in the peripheral programming was high-quality, which was gratifying to see.\u201d\n\nArt-world acquaintances posted on social media from SEA Focus, the south-east Asian contemporary art\u2011curation platform spearheaded by STPI Creative Workshop & Gallery (one of the city\u2019s few internationally renowned arts venues), and from SAM, the Singapore Art Museum. This year, both of them were at Tanjong Pagar Distripark, a multistorey complex at the edge of the water that has in the past two years been emerging as a new arts cluster in its own right: SAM moved into new premises here in 2022, and the site already houses a handful of galleries.\n\nThere were also party shots from off-fair venues, exhibiting degrees of glamour and even a bit of raucousness that looked downright un-Singaporean. \u201cI just felt there was something different,\u201d says Alan Lo, the Hong Kong-born restaurateur, food-tech investor and philanthropist \u2013 he\u2019s the co-founder of Duddell\u2019s in his home city \u2013 of the energy during the event. Lo moved his family to Singapore during the pandemic, trading Hong Kong\u2019s bristle of towers and peaks for Singapore\u2019s fewer, and newer, ones, their sides sometimes furred with vertical greenery; the weaving shophouse-lined streets of Chinatown and Tanjong Pagar, incense still floating from the odd TCM purveyor lodged between two cocktail bars; and its justifiably world-famous 200-acre Botanic Gardens, where wizened qi gong practitioners trace arcane shapes in the air next to tabard-clad bootcampers from Melbourne or Leeds, amid broad-leaf mahogany and tembusu trees.\n\nLo intends to divide his time going forward: \u201cMaybe it has to do with the fact that we\u2019ve seen an influx of new people, whether from the mainland, or all the crypto guys, the tech and VC scenes that have also obviously been growing too. Whatever it was, it\u2019s no longer the sleepy island state that it used to be \u2013 it\u2019s more diverse, and dynamic. The pace is still slower than Hong Kong, but you don\u2019t need that intensity all the time.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, the food scene.\u201d Yes, that. Eating, drinking and nightlife (albeit a tame interpretation thereof) are where the city hit its stride some years ago. Ask a cocktail impresario anywhere in the world which Asian capital is on their radar, and Singapore is likely to be it. Breweries and distilleries now operate alongside homegrown bar concepts, many of them gorgeously designed: from classics such as 28 HongKong Street and Jigger & Pony to Atlas (with its 26ft gin \u201ctower\u201d), Junior The Pocket Bar (named for the teeny-weeny dimensions of its space on Ann Siang Hill), and buzzy newcomers Underdog Inn and Sago House. Singaporeans and the expats who call the city home love a tipple, and they love the new. Not for nothing did exclusive London wine club 67 Pall Mall choose Singapore as the site of its third location last year (and what a location: the 27th-floor flat overlooking Orchard Road formerly belonging to legendary film producer Runme Shaw; the room that was allegedly his bedroom is now known as the \u201cNaughty Corner\u201d).\n\nIn the restaurant world, \u201cyou\u2019re seeing that \u2018adding to the local tapestry\u2019 thing a lot in food and drink\u201d, says Wee Teng Wen, founder of The Lo & Behold Group. Wee has helped to create some of the city\u2019s favourite addresses: Odette, the modern fine-dining venue, took home the \u201cnumber-one in Asia\u201d kudos at the 2019 San Pellegrino World\u2019s Best awards. (His wife, Dawn Ng, is one of Singapore\u2019s few internationally collected and represented artists; a large installation of her work graced the National Gallery Singapore\u2019s atrium during the Fair.)\n\n\u201cChefs are reviving old histories, old recipes,\u201d he continues \u2013 and doing innovative new things with them. He and Alan Lo both cite Malcolm Lee, a young local who made his name reinterpreting the homey Straits-Chinese dishes of his childhood at a restaurant called Candlenut. Last year Candlenut\u2019s business partner, Christina Ong (she of COMO hotels fame), also backed Lee\u2019s new venture, Pangium, in a stunning space overlooking the city\u2019s Botanic Gardens. \u201cIt\u2019s Straits fine degustation \u2013 tasting menus done in a way no one else has,\u201d says Wee.\n\nSingaporeans have COMO\u2019s Ong to thank in part for the evolution of Dempsey Hill, the leafy colonial army barracks-turned-lifestyle destination off Holland Road. Not that Singapore\u2019s urban critical mass is ever especially overwhelming, the clingy humidity notwithstanding; but Dempsey has always been a shady, sedate reprieve atop its hill off Holland Road. Plane trees, their trunks covered in ferns, spread wide, dappled shade over green lawns between the barracks buildings, whose red-tiled roofs and whitewashed colonnades cast a faint bygone-era energetic shadow. Its caf\u00e9s, shops and restaurants have historically been of varying quality but enduringly popular with the city\u2019s Anglo-Euro expat community (for every wagyu burger or margarita joint, a fancy kids\u2019 clobber boutique). Since about 2012, however, Ong has been upgrading in calculated increments. She partnered with Jean-Georges Vongerichten on The Dempsey Cookhouse & Bar, in the same barracks that holds Candlenut; London\u2019s Dover Street Market is now in the one across from it. Culina, her cushy bistro-traiteur \u2013 already a Dempsey stalwart for some years \u2013 was fitted into larger, slicker premises alongside her other venues. Grandiflora, Sydney\u2019s famous floral designers, now has a kiosk. The whole is known as COMO Dempsey, and has become a destination in its own right.\n\nThe halo effect has drawn other names. Australian chef Dave Pynt\u2019s unique carnivore-centric take on modern American barbecue at his restaurant, Burnt Ends, has a diehard following in Singapore and beyond (and earned him a Michelin star). Last year he moved the restaurant\u2019s Chinatown digs to a spectacular \u2013 and 10 times larger \u2013 space in Dempsey: all wood cladding, bold hanging lights, gleaming copper details and a long, long dining bar. \u201cSo much money has poured into Singapore,\u201d Pynt says. \u201cThe volume of people who come through your door\u2026 they\u2019re quite casual here, you know, but they\u2019ve got budgets.\u201d\n\nImportant multinational lifestyle hotel brands are betting on these budgets. The Standard and Edition Hotels groups have planted flags in the vicinity of mall-lined Orchard Road; both will open by early 2024. Talk on the ground has it that Ennismore\u2019s The Hoxton has been in talks about a site in Jalan Besar, east of the CBD (a neighbourhood described by one local friend as \u201cthe Shoreditch of Singapore, such as that is\u201d). Raffles reopened in late 2019 after a two-year, multimillion-pound renovation, and has never been better: all its verandas, spinning fans and four-poster-bed charms intact, but with showcase-y new bars and restaurants, a huge spa and glittering public spaces. A second Raffles, this one a resort, is being developed amid the yacht clubs and tony apartment complexes of Sentosa Island, off Singapore\u2019s south coast.\n\nThe Artling\u2019s Gajardo, meanwhile, is busy installing the art collection she was commissioned to create for the Mondrian Singapore Duxton. The new-build tower rises 13 storeys above Tanjong Pagar, a Chinatown-adjacent neighbourhood of weaving, shophouse-lined streets, small parks and fragrant temples that is historically one of Singapore\u2019s primary nightlife hubs; an ace location, in other words. When it opens next month \u2013 with 302 rooms and suites, multiple restaurants and bars, a rooftop pool, and art by the likes of Ian Davenport and Andre Wee adorning its walls \u2013 the Mondrian will offer experiences that tie guests into the culture of the surrounding streets: hawker centre deep-dives, cult cocktail bars and small museums.\n\nLo & Behold\u2019s Wee is already a hotelier; the Group opened the 37-room Warehouse Hotel, in a listed former go-down (local vernacular for a shipping warehouse) that was once a discoth\u00e8que, in 2017, and it remains one of the city\u2019s cooler stays. These days, he\u2019s contending with co-living spaces, which are part of the company\u2019s most ambitious project to date: the redevelopment of a former girls\u2019 school, a full 230,000sq ft of empty space near Robertson Quay, a street or so away from the Singapore River. \u201cThe scale is kind of scary,\u201d he admits with a smile. \u201cBut it goes back to what we do as a group, which is always about filling the gaps in the lifestyle ecosystem.\u201d When it\u2019s finished \u2013 some time next year, Wee reckons \u2013 the site will include boutiques with local designers and makers as tenants, a few curated eating and drinking outlets (of course), and an art exhibition and education space in the old hall. Lo & Behold will operate a couple of these restaurants; the rest are tendered out. \u201cThere are so many great local creatives and entrepreneurs \u2013 in retail, wellness, design \u2013 who are just completely off the radar,\u201d Wee says. \u201cMost don\u2019t fit into the mall thing, which is still the primary retail platform, so they\u2019re dislocated all over the city. The idea is to bring them together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about this neighbourhood,\u201d he says earnestly, warming to a topic he knows more about than most Singaporeans. \u201cIt\u2019s a good expat mix; it\u2019s equidistant between Orchard Road and the CBD. But it\u2019s very under-served. Because most of the F&B runs along the quay, there\u2019s no nucleus; we want to create that nucleus.\u201d Worth revisiting the city in a year\u2019s time again, then \u2013 d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or no.", "tag": "singapore?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d3afcc7a-a67c-4c32-b4c6-49af4a30185a"}, {"uuid4": "4a59e562-dfa0-40eb-bd9c-ef381a6f2c5b", "title": "Cannes prizewinner Payal Kapadia: \u2018In India identity comes in the way of a lot of things\u2019", "description": "The director of \u2018All We Imagine as Light\u2019 discusses big city lives, urban migration and Mumbai\u2019s violent gentrification", "author": "Prathap Nair", "published_date": "2024-11-15T05:00:42.588Z", "content": "When Payal Kapadia finally took her Cannes Grand Prix-winning film All We Imagine as Light to Mumbai, it felt like a long-awaited homecoming. In the place she calls home, and where the film is set, it opened the Mami film festival in the historic art deco Regal cinema, one of the last remaining single screens in the city.\n\nThe late October weather was oppressively warm, but it also rained that day, notching up the humidity. Evoking sweaty train rides and pouring monsoon rains, it was a fitting reflection of the atmospheric imagery in Kapadia\u2019s film.\n\n\u201cIt was super nice,\u201d recalls the writer-director from her home in Mumbai. \u201cFinally the film is back where it belongs, and I\u2019m very happy that people took very different things from it.\u201d\n\nSince Cannes, Kapadia has been travelling the world as her Malayalam-language film has become a festival darling, receiving near-unanimous critical acclaim, collecting awards and generating Oscar buzz. For Kapadia, an up-and-coming filmmaker who made her debut feature film on a shoestring budget, this level of success has come suddenly.\n\nHowever, she is no stranger to Cannes. In 2017 her short film \u201cAfternoon Clouds\u201d was included in a section for new talent, and in 2021 her hybrid docu-fiction A Night of Knowing Nothing, set amid student protests at her alma mater, appeared in the Directors\u2019 Fortnight section and won the L\u2019Oeil d\u2019or award.\n\nBut her real exposure into the limelight came only this year, as All We Imagine as Light, which was largely produced and financed in France, became the first Indian film to appear in Cannes\u2019 main competition in 30 years. Kapadia lays the blame for this dearth firmly with the festival.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t choose other Indian films,\u201d she says, mildly exasperated. \u201cWe make really good films, so that\u2019s on them\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Eeb Allay Ooo! by Prateek Vats was in the Berlin Film Festival\u2019s Panorama section in 2020 \u2014 it\u2019s a great film. Rima Das makes amazing work. Anamika Haksar\u2019s films are absolutely radical \u2014 so other festivals have been selecting Indian films regularly.\u201d\n\nAll We Imagine as Light follows two Malayali nurses from Kerala \u2014 Prabha (played by Kani Kusruti) and Anu (Divya Prabha) \u2014 who work in a Mumbai hospital and share a crammed and wind-battered flat with a pregnant cat. Prabha is tightly wound to the point of sullenness and is a stickler for morality. Her husband purportedly lives in Germany but hasn\u2019t been in touch for more than a year. The younger Anu, on the other hand, is a free spirit who secretly sexts with her boyfriend. What\u2019s more, she is Hindu and he is Muslim, something frowned upon or even restricted by law in parts of India (though not in Mumbai). She also slips pregnancy pills under the counter to women patients who have little reproductive agency. When the duo\u2019s mutual friend Parvati, a hospital cook, is forced to move because of gentrification, Anu and Prabha embark on a road trip to help her settle back into her village.\n\nThe film captures the push and pull of existential challenges in the big city and ponders questions of identity, belonging and displacement. Shot in gauzy shades of blue and ochre, Mumbai serves as a muted backdrop as Kapadia quietly ruminates on life on its peripheries.\n\nShe admits she doesn\u2019t know how to define her film, but the women at its centre epitomise the hardworking migrant labour that powers one of the world\u2019s largest metropolises. This may explain its broad appeal. \u201cI think people from big cities like New York and Paris identified with it,\u201d she says. \u201cThis thing about happenstance female friendships in such places is something that I think speaks to everybody.\u201d\n\nKapadia was interested in exploring the intergenerational friendship between the three women and wanted to dissect the question of love and desire in South Asian households. \u201cPrabha\u2019s relationship has this kind of legitimacy because she\u2019s a married woman. But Anu is in love with a boy that nobody will accept. Even though she\u2019s in love, it\u2019s [considered] illegitimate,\u201d she says.\n\nThe secondary character of Parvati grew from Kapadia\u2019s urge to portray Mumbai\u2019s gentrification. She says that moving back to the city after studying in the neighbouring city of Pune, she was shocked to see how much Mumbai had changed. \u201cThe areas I grew up in \u2014 Lower Parel and Dadar \u2014 had especially gone through a kind of violent gentrification. I felt that I needed to have a character who embodied the pain of that,\u201d she says.\n\nShe also wanted to unpick complex identity issues in multicultural Indian society. \u201cI was interested in this odd friendship between a Marathi cook [Parvati] and a Malayali nurse [Prabha], which in real life is not very common. In my utopian imagination, I wanted to say that this could be a possibility. Because I think that in India identity comes in the way of a lot of things. At least in friendship, it shouldn\u2019t be the case \u2014 that\u2019s my hope,\u201d she adds.\n\nWhile global and Indian festival audiences and critics took to the film immediately, All We Imagine as Light faced public criticism from an unlikely source. The Film Federation of India (FFI), when considering India\u2019s submission for best international feature at next year\u2019s Oscars, commented that Kapadia\u2019s film felt like \u201ca European film taking place in India\u201d. The honour was given instead to Kiran Rao\u2019s feminist dramedy Laapataa Ladies.\n\nAlthough she has cited European auteurs such as Chantal Akerman and Agn\u00e8s Varda as influences for their blending of fiction and documentary, Kapadia\u2019s sensibilities are clearly grounded in India. Her film studies curriculum was packed with the work of the masters of Indian Parallel Cinema, a movement noted for its unvarnished realism that began in the 1950s with the seminal Satyajit Ray and continued through to the 1980s with luminaries such as Mani Kaul and Shyam Benegal.\n\nKapadia was influenced by the work of Govindan Aravindan and John Abraham, who made probing films about the human psyche on frighteningly small budgets. Abraham\u2019s filmmaking style especially fascinated her. \u201cI was inspired by his technique \u2014 editing, sound design and the use of stop-motion,\u201d she says. \u201cHe packs in small moments of delight in very political films.\u201d\n\nEmulating this approach, Kapadia used a handheld DSLR camera to capture the everyday Mumbai street scenes her film opens with \u2014 workers unloading produce early in the morning, sellers sorting their wares, the throng of humanity on trains and at festival time. Shooting on tightly packed streets made her more aware of their personal space, she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a bit shy to put cameras in people\u2019s faces. I tried to be mindful and the process taught me to be not intrusive.\u201d\n\nWhat emerges on screen is the gaze of a filmmaker capable of seeing humanity in the tiniest details of her subjects, bringing together elements of Indian arthouse and the European New Wave.\n\nFor Kapadia, it was vital for her that All We Imagine as Light got a theatrical release. \u201cI hope the [success] sends a signal that films like mine are worth funding and distributing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is really important to me that the film has a life in cinemas so its journey is truly complete, unlike dumping it directly in streaming platforms.\u201d\n\n\u2018All We Imagine as Light\u2019 is in UK cinemas from November 29\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FTWeekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life and Art wherever you listen", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6869b994-852f-4ea4-bbe7-652829253e90"}, {"uuid4": "3fd62799-ca4f-48fd-a552-8219f746bbd5", "title": "Disney-Reliance Indian media giant says TV \u2018is not dead\u2019 following $8.5bn merger ", "description": "Head of newly formed Jio Star says traditional linear format is still important in the country during streaming era ", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2024-11-14T14:58:21.810Z", "content": "The head of Disney and Reliance Industries\u2019 newly merged $8.5bn Indian entertainment titan plans to invest and \u201crevitalise\u201d television in the world\u2019s most populous country even as western media organisations increasingly see it as a dying medium.\n\nUday Shankar, vice-chair of Jio Star \u2014 the freshly formed company whose merger was completed on Thursday \u2014 said traditional television revenue could experience \u201csignificant double-digit growth within the next several years\u201d on the back of fresh investment in innovative content ranging from dramas to soaps.\n\n\u201cThere is this whole narrative that television is dead and it\u2019s all about streaming,\u201d Shankar told the Financial Times in Mumbai in his first interview since the combination was approved by India\u2019s regulators. \u201cTelevision in this country for sure is not dead.\u201d\n\nWhile lagging growth in online streaming, Shankar pointed to a still robust linear pay-TV industry as more Indians steadily join the middle class.\n\nEY predicts TV revenue in India, from subscribers and advertising, will increase by 10 per cent to $9bn in the three years through to 2026, while TV ownership will climb at a similar pace to reach 202mn sets.\n\n\u201cA large number of people are coming into the economic mainstream every year,\u201d Shankar said. \u201cOne of the aspirational items of consumption that they acquire, or they want to acquire, is a TV.\u201d\n\nShankar\u2019s comments came as he outlined his plans after Disney and Reliance, the conglomerate run by Asia\u2019s wealthiest man Mukesh Ambani that spans petrochemicals, retail and telecoms, agreed earlier this year to combine their Indian entertainment assets.\n\nThe combined entity has more than 100 television stations and more than 50mn streaming subscribers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a monster merger\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009there is no competition,\u201d said Shankar, a media industry veteran who will run the company, which is chaired by Ambani\u2019s wife, Nita. \u201cWe have to reinvent the market and make it much bigger.\u201d\n\nThe joint venture came together earlier this year after Disney battled to gain traction in India\u2019s huge cricket and film markets, which have both tempted and thwarted global media majors who have struggled with highly cost-conscious audiences and fierce local competition.\n\nAfter Disney acquired Star India in 2019 from Fox, the business became a financial drag. Internal debate swirled on whether to exit the country entirely, particularly after Ambani\u2019s Reliance won the streaming rights to the wildly popular Indian Premier League short-format cricket tournament.\n\nThe new Jio Star, formed from these lossmaking media businesses, aims to hit profitability within five years. Investment bank Jefferies has compared its control over Indian sports rights to that of ESPN in the US and Sky Sports in the UK.\n\nThe media group, which has a roughly 35 per cent market share in TV, won over competition authorities after promising to shed a handful of regional TV channels and not bundle advertisements across its cricket portfolio or to raise rates exponentially.\n\nShankar said that \u201cdominance in sports is highly overrated\u201d and criticism of Disney and Reliance\u2019s hold was \u201csomewhat uninformed because sports rights in this country are awarded to you for a frighteningly short period of time \u2014 it\u2019s anything from three to five years\u201d.\n\nOther Indian media houses have also attempted to downplay the industry impact of the merger.\n\nPunit Goenka, chief executive of Zee Entertainment, whose long-planned tie-up with Sony would have created a $10bn rival to Jio Star before it acrimoniously collapsed earlier this year, said he did not expect to see much change after competing with the duo previously as independent companies.\n\n\u201cTheir entire strategy is sports-focused whereas our strategy is completely entertainment-focused and, therefore, I do not think that we are really competing in that space or that segment,\u201d he said on an earnings call last month.\n\n\u201cThey may have a little bit more leverage on the advertising dollars that they can command given that they may have a significantly higher market share.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fe860e58-5412-469e-9444-5a79627e908e"}, {"uuid4": "d2411d1b-b9a7-4a4c-98e4-dedd07539379", "title": "The eerie quietness of India\u2019s new financial hotspot ", "description": "Narendra Modi\u2019s GIFT City has already lured JPMorgan and HSBC but the social side has been slow to catch up", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2024-11-14T05:00:41.720Z", "content": "Standing on his office balcony in India\u2019s searing afternoon heat, veteran civil servant K Rajaraman gestures across a panoramic sweep of cranes. They tower over the skeletal structures of tower blocks and a nearly finished metro system. This 886-acre work-in-progress is Gujarat International Finance Tec-City \u2014 also known as GIFT City \u2014 India\u2019s most ambitiously business-friendly project to date.\n\nFast-talking Rajaraman, who heads the regulator that oversees the onshore tax haven, recently returned from the US where he was drumming up more investment. International interest, he says, is \u201cproof of the pudding\u201d that it will be a success. The number of organisations flocking to the city \u2014 a long-standing pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and created in his home state \u2014 already exceeds 700.\n\nThis is even more impressive given GIFT City\u2019s location in one of India\u2019s few dry states. It is a world away from the choked up chaos and energetic drive of cosmopolitan financial capital Mumbai, with its beery taprooms and fine dining.\n\nGujarat, which juts out into the sea in north-west India, is not on most tourist to-do lists \u2014 though it contains a national park in the south that is the last known natural habitat of the Asiatic lion. The state is largely a vast, alluvial plain with some low mountains. It is considered conservative and business focused.\n\nFittingly, GIFT city, which sits on the banks of the Sabarmati River in a flat and dusty landscape, offers something more pragmatic than Mumbai\u2019s buzzing nightlife. As a special economic zone, it avoids India\u2019s onerous red tape and strict capital controls, while granting 100 per cent tax exemptions over 10 of 15 years. Those sweeteners have lured businesses from JPMorgan to HSBC as well as Australian universities, insurance houses, ship leasers and local tech titans Infosys and Wipro.\n\nAlready, it is rising up the Global Financial Centres Index, which ranks competitiveness in over hundred hubs, from 92 three years ago to 52. That places it ahead of Mumbai.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Modi\u2019s baby and allows his administration to say they are opening up,\u201d said one western diplomat who has visited. Still, they pointed out that some foreign businesses were shying away because the city is in \u201cthe middle of nowhere\u201d. \u201cAre top investment bankers going to relocate there with limited nightlife and a few mid-range hotels?\u201d they added.\n\nAlthough more than 20,000 employees already work here, the area remains eerily quiet. Well paved roads carry little traffic. Entertainment options have been slow to arrive. \u201cIt\u2019s a chicken and egg situation,\u201d said an executive who has set up a new office in the city. He estimates it will take at least five years for the city\u2019s social element to liven up.\n\nThere have already been some compromises over Gujarat\u2019s prohibitive laws. Late last year the state government published guidelines that in theory allow the sale of alcohol in parts of the city. However this message has not reached everyone. The staff at one hotel with a supposed liquor licence looked puzzled by my thirsty enquiries.\n\nA fund manager preparing to set up shop here compares the district\u2019s early days to those of Dubai, another arid and previously alcohol-free financial hotspot. \u201cDubai initially was not very open to that,\u201d they said, acknowledging that good staffing would remain a \u201cchallenge\u201d. \u201cWe have a massive operation in Mumbai, so there\u2019s going to be a ton of support out of there initially.\u201d\n\nThe long-term political viability of GIFT City has also come into question after a weakened Modi returned to power following a worse than expected electoral showing earlier in the year. Now beholden to coalition parties during his third term, some observers wonder if the project will survive should India\u2019s opposition eventually come back to power.\n\nRajaraman brushes aside such concerns, calling the economic transformation across the country \u201cunstoppable\u201d and the new city\u2019s growth a key part of that drive. No matter who has been in power, he says, \u201cthe Indian reform story has been continuous for decades\u201d.\n\nchris.kay@ft.com", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8ffa96f6-3f98-4d4d-a68a-805875268626"}, {"uuid4": "a70fc5ea-2bf6-49a3-8e41-1711808d7f7a", "title": "Caste remains off-limits in corporate India\u2019s drive for diversity", "description": "The push to remedy workplace inequalities does not extend to the country\u2019s ancient system of hierarchy", "author": "Hannah Gardner", "published_date": "2024-11-14T01:00:40.923Z", "content": "Browse the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) web pages of corporate India and you may notice the frequent absence of one word: \u201ccaste\u201d.\n\n\u201cGender\u201d, \u201csexuality\u201d, \u201cphysical ability\u201d and \u201crace\u201d all get regular mentions on these public-facing sites, but \u201ccaste\u201d \u2014 which negatively affects the lives of hundreds of millions of Indians \u2014 is usually missing.\n\nOccasionally, the term can be found in downloadable documents, such as a company\u2019s code of conduct. But, often, it is omitted there, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising \u2014 it\u2019s not a topic most Indian companies want to talk about,\u201d says Christina Dhanuja, a DEI-caste strategist based in Chennai, South India.\n\nCaste \u2014 an ancient system of social hierarchy based on purity and heredity \u2014 is a sensitive topic in India because discussing it also means talking about the privilege of the upper castes and the role of the country\u2019s dominant religion, Hinduism.\n\nIt is also a subject that induces fatigue, because much has already been tried. India banned caste-based discrimination when it wrote its new constitution after independence in 1947 and it reserves 50 per cent of government jobs and university places for marginalised groups.\n\nBut these quotas are contentious and breed resentment among those who feel they cannot land coveted government jobs as a result. \u201cIt\u2019s why our officials are so inefficient,\u201d the boss of a chartered accountancy company told the FT recently.\n\nWith these measures failing to bring about equality or the demise of caste, many have placed their hopes in economic growth and modernisation. Yet, increasingly, this appears to have been a false hope and caste is now the lens through which many are viewing economic inequality.\n\n\u201cAn undeniably unique feature of economic inequalities in India is that they are closely intertwined with the deeply rooted caste system,\u201d say economists including Thomas Piketty in a recent report for the World Inequality Lab (WIL), a Paris-based research organisation.\n\nIndeed, it is such a feature that, this month, the south Indian state of Telangana became the third to hold a caste census, to establish which communities are being left behind.\n\nIndia\u2019s opposition parties are also calling for a national caste census \u2014 to which the ruling Bharatiya Janata party may have to agree, given that low-caste Indians make up the majority of the population.\n\nCaste was first laid out in Hindu scripture 3,000 years ago and has evolved into a hierarchy of four levels: Brahmins, or priests, at the top; followed by rulers and warriors; then merchants and labourers; and, below all, the Dalits, or untouchables.\n\nPriests and warriors, together, are referred to as the upper castes and they own about 55 per cent of the country\u2019s wealth, according to the WIL. They are thought to account for about 20 per cent of the population, but no one knows for sure because the last caste census was in 1931.\n\nDalits account for about 16 per cent of the population, or 220mn people, and can still face exclusion or even violence because of their caste, especially in rural areas. Labourers \u2014 who can also face discrimination \u2014 account for about 50 per cent, or 700mn people.\n\nCaste is not as strictly enforced in cities, but it still plays a role in almost all social and economic relationships.\n\n\u201cPeople in companies like to say they are caste blind but, in reality, caste is everywhere,\u201d says Meenakshi, a DEI expert with the Chennai-based human resources consultancy Kelp who prefers not to give a surname because of its privileged caste associations.\n\nMany people still get asked their caste in job interviews and some Brahmin groups organise Brahmin-only job fairs.\n\nOne CEO of an investment firm recently told the FT that he did not feel bad about the caste imbalance at his firm because \u201cDalits have the quota system for their jobs\u201d. He added that his company has a corporate social responsibility policy that assists marginalised communities through charity.\n\nDEI principles finally arrived in India via multinational companies a few years ago, and have taken off both as corporate policy and as a public relations tactic.\n\nHowever, Meenakshi says its provenance meant it came with priorities dictated by the west: it gave huge importance to issues such as women and race, but largely skipped over the issue of caste.\n\nMany Indian companies have stuck with this template, but Meenakshi, Dhanuja and others want to \u201cIndianise\u201d the model so it incorporates caste at a high level.\n\nThis, they argue, will be good for the companies involved, unlocking wider pools of talent and a greater diversity of views. They point to various studies by McKinsey, the management consultancy, showing that the more racially and gender diverse company is, the better it performs.\n\nSimilarly, in 2019, the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore released a paper showing that, when two companies dominated by different castes merge or acquire one another, they generate more market value then when two companies dominated by the same caste unite. However, the paper also noted that most companies prefer to merge with or buy entities with the same caste profile.\n\nThis search for sameness affects Indian companies\u2019 hiring, too. In 2012, Canadian researchers found that 91 per cent of board directors in India\u2019s top 1,000 companies came from the top two castes.\n\nAnd a study by Jawaharlal Nehru University, in that same year, showed that candidates with high-caste Hindu names were 60 per cent more likely to be called for interview than people with low-caste names if otherwise identical CVs were submitted.\n\nStatistics on the exact make-up of organisations today are impossible to find because very few companies keep records on caste. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that lower castes are vastly unrepresented in well-paid jobs.\n\n\u201cIn an office of one hundred, you might not find a single Dalit,\u201d says Vaibhav Wankede, a marketing executive from Mumbai who has written about the difficulties of being lower caste in white collar workplaces.\n\nHe says that Dalits often feel they need to mask their identity at work. \u201cIt\u2019s everything from the food we eat, to the holidays we celebrate \u2014 all of that is a marker of who we are and a potential reason for exclusion,\u201d Wankede explains, adding that \u201cmost Dalits just try to keep their heads down and get on with the work.\u201d\n\nTo address the issue, Dhanuja suggests starting with something small like a survey, and then building up to in-person awareness sessions where the impact of caste is discussed.\n\nBut she says the way managers ultimately decide to bring caste into their DEI polices depends on the industry, the composition of their current staff, and what goals they set.\n\nMeenakshi advocates a similar approach, focusing on teaching people what casteism looks like, and rethinking hiring practices so companies spot candidates who have skills they really need.\n\n\u201cAll too often, the definition of merit is shaped by the skills upper-caste candidates tend to have: good spoken English, social confidence,\u201d Meenakshi cautions \u2014 adding that companies should not discount the tenacity and hard work it takes for a lower-caste candidate to get to the same interview as higher-caste candidates.\n\nLastly, Dhanuja says companies should consider putting out caste-positive jobs ads, explicitly stating that roles are open to people of Dalit or other marginalised backgrounds.\n\nShe would, she says, go further and set targets for lower-caste hires, but she knows from quotas in the state sector that this can easily fail if HR managers are unsupportive.\n\nFor companies that think this all sounds too much like hard work, Dhanuja points out that caste awareness is on the rise and failure to adapt is risky. \u201cIf a company doesn\u2019t want to do anything about it, they are just exposing themselves to law suits and reputational damage,\u201d she warns.\n\nBut Pratap Tambe \u2014 a manager at Tata Consultancy Services and a frequent speaker on caste \u2014 is less convinced. He warns that any sudden shifts could result in a \u201cbacklash from negatively impacted interests\u201d and a \u201chigh risk\u201d of false discrimination allegations.\n\n\u200bLetter in response to this article:\n\nLoans drive progress in India\u2019s caste system\u00a0/\u00a0From Sunil Choudhary and Gil Yaron", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b0a7eb5e-2f03-4855-81ea-3d8fd07e4b26"}, {"uuid4": "b68419d1-5d88-4d17-be15-be5e2f63b4ee", "title": "The Imaginary Institution of India: Art 1975-1998 \u2014 Barbican exhibition review", "description": "A London show reveals how artists responded to the crumbling of post-independence ideals", "author": "Maya Jaggi", "published_date": "2024-11-13T05:01:01.439Z", "content": "In \u201cDream Houses\u201d, a 1969 film by Nalini Malani, the promise of social housing in newly independent India is conjured through a stop-motion animation of an architectural model in iridescent colours. But seven years later, in Malani\u2019s dual-channel video installation \u201cUtopia\u201d, its pulsing optimism is undercut by black-and-white footage of a woman in a high-rise gazing down at condemned shacks. The ironic juxtaposition reflects the crushing disillusionment triggered in 1975 by prime minister Indira Gandhi\u2019s state of emergency.\n\nAlongside a programme of forced sterilisation to target population growth, Malani tells me in London, the prime minister\u2019s son, Sanjay Gandhi, moved to \u201caestheticise the city and remove all the slums\u201d. One where she was filming in Mumbai was razed overnight. For artists such as Malani, this trampling of civil liberties crystallised the shocking collapse of Nehruvian democratic ideals since independence.\n\nThe emergency of 1975-77 is the starting point for The Imaginary Institution of India: Art 1975-1998, a cogent and compelling group exhibition at the Barbican Gallery in London, in collaboration with the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art in New Delhi. This private museum loaned more than half of the 150 works by 30 artists in a show focused on a seminal period that has disturbing echoes today. A parallel film season, Rewriting the Rules: Pioneering Indian Cinema after 1970, runs to December 12.\n\nAlthough 1947, and the generational trauma of partition, tend to be seen as paramount, says Shanay Jhaveri, the show\u2019s curator and Barbican head of visual arts, the emergency was a watershed. As artists confronted the post-independence realities of India\u2019s failing infrastructure, population explosion, poverty and unrest, he tells me, \u201cutopian ideals dissipated; art history gets entwined with social history.\u201d\n\nFear of repression pervades the desolate streets in Gulammohammed Sheikh\u2019s oil painting \u201cSpeechless City\u201d (1975), deserted but for marauding animals against a blood-orange background. Sheikh, who had studied in London, was among figurative painters who drew on Indian miniatures for their urban narratives. Others turned to satire and caricature, from Vivan Sundaram\u2019s scabrous pastel and ink work of Gandhi and son as grotesque gangsters, \u201cThe Pair\u201d (1976), to Rameshwar Broota\u2019s brilliantly economical oil painting on corrupt power, \u201cReconstruction\u201d (1977), in which an arrogantly enthroned general intimidates the faceless minions around him.\n\nObserving the widening gap between vaunted progress and those left behind, artists were drawn to the forgotten. In Sudhir Patwardhan\u2019s oil painting \u201cDhakka\u201d (1977), a muscular labourer\u2019s back fills the canvas as he bends wearily to pick up his clothes, while in the craggy landscape of beggars and dejected workers in \u201cOverbridge\u201d (1981), the sumptuous blue of a man\u2019s shirt forces the viewer\u2019s gaze to his haunted face.\n\nLike Patwardhan, Gieve Patel earned his living as a doctor in Mumbai, before commercial galleries opened in India. \u201cOff Lamington Road\u201d (1982-86) fixes in pastel colours the gamut of ecstasy and desperation he witnessed. In an alley crowded with goats and scooters, a man collapses. A woman lies bleeding. Others dance joyously amid the destitute. In the show\u2019s opening oil painting, the chatting workers in Patel\u2019s \u201cTwo Men With Hand Cart\u201d (1979) are overshadowed by skyscrapers. Yet the pop-art pink of a monsoon sunset bathes the work in ebullient beauty and hope.\n\nIn bleak contrast are Savindra Sawarkar\u2019s etchings of Dalit pariahs weighed down by the pots and brooms marking their so-called untouchability, and Pablo Bartholomew\u2019s 1984 photographs of the aftermath of the Union Carbide gas disaster in Bhopal. In an unforgettable close-up, a father\u2019s disembodied hand reaches towards a child\u2019s face protruding, with sightlessly open eyes, from the dirt.\n\nThe link between art and activism becomes explicit in staged photography. Sheba Chhachhi\u2019s black-and-white series Seven Lives and a Dream (1980-91) combines documentary images of anti-dowry demonstrations with staged portraits of women activists. Sunil Gupta\u2019s Exiles (1987) pictures gay men at public monuments, such as a couple embracing at India Gate. Although homosexuality was decriminalised in 2018, the artist notes in the catalogue, the law \u201cstill only allow[s] gay sex in private\u201d. Bhupen Khakhar skewers such absurdities in his oil painting \u201cTwo Men in Benares\u201d (1982), in which a naked gay couple, penises erect, embrace furtively in the shadows while, in a distant temple, a holy man prostrates himself before a shiva lingam \u2014 a sacred phallus.\n\nWhile the fast-expanding metropolis inspired art, urban artists \u2014\u00a0many of them privileged \u2014\u00a0championed rural and Adivasi (indigenous) art. Jyoti Bhatt\u2019s photography documented disappearing traditions, while others gave ancient arts a contemporary edge, whether Meera Mukherjee\u2019s beguiling, small-scale lost-wax bronze sculptures, or Himmat Shah\u2019s modernist-inflected terracotta heads. Not only do Jagdish Swaminathan\u2019s abstract canvases meld colour-field painting with tribal motifs, but as founding director of the Bharat Bhavan arts complex in Bhopal in 1982, he showed Adivasi art alongside that of contemporary artists \u2014 a radical approach he termed \u201ccontemporaneity\u201d.\n\nThe largely wall-based works give way to installations in the 1990s, as the dual rise of communalism and consumerism transfigured art. MF Husain\u2019s acrylic painting \u201cSafdar Hashmi\u201d (1989), depicting a murdered playwright with twisted limbs, is a harbinger of violence to come. Arpita Singh\u2019s oil painting \u201cMy Mother\u201d (1993) captures the riots that swept the country after the Ayodhya mosque was razed by a Hindu mob in 1992; its woman in white frowns amid the shrouded bodies lined up on the ground as green-uniformed militiamen wreak havoc. In the saturated, dreamlike colour of Sheikh\u2019s oil painting \u201cHow Can You Sleep Tonight?\u201d (1994-95), a couple lying awake in the moonlight embody a restless call to conscience.\n\nA host of artists responded to turbulent times by abandoning figurative painting altogether. Rummana Hussain\u2019s shattered terracotta pots, from which red powder spills like blood, are a visceral response to the carnage she fled in Mumbai, while Sheela Gowda\u2019s cow dung sculptures, from patties to bricks, resonate with the cow\u2019s associations to women\u2019s work and non-violence. The material clashes with the spiritual in NN Rimzon\u2019s \u201cThe Tools\u201d (1993), whose fibreglass figure with arms raised in devotion stands in a ring of rusting agricultural implements that could become cudgels.

The facility \u2014 a potent symbol of an enduring reliance on polluting energy \u2014 fuels the skyscrapers and homes of India\u2019s financial capital.\n\nIndia\u2019s energy-hungry economy is sucking up more electricity than its green sources can provide, despite the billions of dollars invested in solar and wind farms by conglomerates such as Adani Group and Tata Sons, whose energy arm Tata Power operates the Trombay plant.\n\nThat means the world\u2019s third-largest carbon emitter, after the US and China, remains wedded to its abundant coal power for more than 70 per cent of its electricity generation.\n\nAt the same time, the country is being ravaged by weather extremes from the world\u2019s changing climate. Punishing heatwaves, for example, have prompted better off citizens to invest in air conditioners, exacerbating the problem.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s situation is actually highlighting the complexity of energy transition,\u201d says Nandini Das, a climate and energy economist at Climate Analytics, a research institute. \u201cIndia still has a very deep focus on coal.\u201d\n\nThe problem is acute for the country as it industrialises its economy, subsidising both carbon-heavy businesses and renewable sectors to promote their growth, in a bid to become a manufacturing hub that can steal market share from its Asian rival, China.\n\nOver the past three years, this has helped to turn solar and wind energy into its cheapest form of electricity.\n\nThe switch came about after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set out plans to reach net zero by 2070 and his administration began pushing to make renewable sources half the energy mix by 2030.\n\n\u201cCurrently, electricity from large renewable energy plants is much cheaper than new coal-based power plants, making it a win-win for both [the] climate and the economy,\u201d says Nandikesh Sivalingam, director at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a research organisation.\n\nHowever, India\u2019s increasing use of coal to make up for shortfalls in electricity drove production and imports to a record in the first half of 2024, and is a \u201cdrag\u201d on its green ambitions, according to scientific group Climate Action Tracker. It rates the nation\u2019s climate targets and climate action as \u201chighly insufficient\u201d.\n\nIndia\u2019s share of global greenhouse gas emissions increased to 7.5 per cent in 2022, from 6.7 per cent in 2019, according to rating agency Moody\u2019s, which now forecasts that power consumption will rise 46 per cent to 2,524 terawatt hours by 2031.\n\nThe agency also estimates that India will need extra funding of up to $215bn over the next seven years to bridge its renewable financing gap so that it can install around 44 gigawatts each year to hit its target of 500GW of green energy.\n\nChristian de Guzman, senior vice-president at Moody\u2019s, says that, while India\u2019s progress has been \u201ctangible and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009frankly, quite impressive given the pace of growth in this economy, they\u2019re not investing enough basically to meet their medium-term decarbonisation goals\u201d.\n\nModi\u2019s government, which faces multiple spending demands, cannot be expected to \u201cfully plug\u201d that amount, de Guzman adds.\n\nIndia\u2019s green transition is also clashing with political and economic realities. Only about 2 per cent of passenger vehicles sold in India are battery-powered. They are more expensive than combustion-engine vehicles and their charging and battery-swapping infrastructure is limited, hindering the industry\u2019s growth in a country where GDP per capital is less than $3,000.\n\nAt the same time, India faces an employment crisis with a chronic shortage of formal jobs, raising questions about how it will provide work for millions, as well as support farmers. Agriculture accounts for about 22 per cent of India\u2019s emissions, which is double the world average, with livestock\u2019s methane emissions and dairy making significant contributions, Moody\u2019s says.\n\n\u201cThe agenda of decarbonisation should not end up costing us,\u201d argues Amir Bazaz, head of infrastructure and climate at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements.\n\nStill, the world\u2019s most populous nation faces pressure from abroad and Indian officials bristle when questioned on their climate commitments. They say developed nations are responsible for historical emissions and countries such as India are morally right to use whatever energy source is readily available so they can catch up economically.\n\nFinance minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently denounced the EU\u2019s planned carbon tax on imports, which will be levied from 2026, as \u201cstifling\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe keep reminding ourselves in India that the emissions per capita is only a third of what the average emission per capita is globally,\u201d she told the Financial Times\u2019 Energy Transition Summit India in New Delhi in October.\n\nBut Das at Climate Analytics calls that mindset \u201cvery naive\u201d, given India\u2019s extreme climate vulnerability, as evidenced by increasing flooding and brutal temperatures.\n\nIn August, however, PM Prasad, chair of state-owned Coal India, which accounts for about 80 per cent of the country\u2019s output, said his \u201cvision is to ensure that there is no shortage of coal\u201d and that \u201cdespite the country\u2019s deep commitment to renewable energy, for climate change considerations, coal [will] continue to be pivotal for [a] few more years\u201d.\n\nWith power cuts disrupting even India\u2019s most affluent cities, Modi\u2019s government is on board with that future, too. It has drawn out the lifespan of ageing thermal plants and wants to open 100 new coal mines with a production capacity of 500mn tonnes per annum by 2030 \u2014 to achieve Aatmanirbhar Bharat, or \u2018a self-reliant India\u2019, in fossil-fuel power generation.\n\n\u201cWe are going to add more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; it\u2019s us who are going to be impacted,\u201d says Das. \u201cIt\u2019s not that by doing this we are giving [developed nations] some lesson, saying \u2018now it\u2019s our turn\u2019.

The share of manufacturing in GDP has remained stubbornly low, even declining over the past decade despite the government\u2019s enormous subsidy programme to encourage companies to \u201cMake in India\u201d. Can this failure be reversed, given the opportunity created by the stampede of capital away from China?\n\nThere are glimmers of hope. One state in southern India \u2014 Tamil Nadu \u2014 is experiencing a manufacturing boom, attracting the likes of Cisco, Corning, Foxconn, Ford, Google, Tata Electronics and Tata Jaguar Land Rover, and Nike suppliers. These investments are integrating India into global supply chains for electronics, automotives and footwear. What is the secret to its success?\n\nThere\u2019s scope. The state\u2019s manufacturing investments encompass a much wider range than elsewhere in India, notably including labour-intensive activities. This is puzzling, since Tamil Nadu is among the richest states in the country. So how can it attract labour-intensive manufacturing while much poorer states cannot? Essentially, because factories have been willing to tap pools of lower-wage workers, such as migrants from other Indian states and women. In fact, 40 per cent of all women employed in factories in India are in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThen there\u2019s scale. Several of the new projects will provide employment in the tens of thousands. This is astonishing in a country where the median company in labour-intensive industries employs just 21 workers, making it too small to be globally competitive.\n\nTamil Nadu \u2014 unlike India more generally \u2014 has also created the perception that it is a relatively easy place to do business. The state has long had a well-developed educational system, churning out hundreds of thousands of engineering graduates every year. This had made it the country\u2019s manufacturing powerhouse, especially in automobiles and auto parts, which attracted considerable FDI in the boom years of the noughties. In addition, it offers generous incentives to investors.\n\nBut such incentives are available throughout India. The state\u2019s talented engineers could be employed elsewhere. In Tamil Nadu, however, the state government has also grasped the critical importance of minimising risks to investors.\u00a0There is a political consensus that once investors set up shop, they should not be subject to policy reversals, neglect, or discrimination.\n\nTwo examples are illustrative. In 2021, a food poisoning incident at an electronics plant seemed poised to become a full-scale political incident. The government swung into action, working with both capital and labour. It helped the victims speedily, thereby ensuring minimal operational disruption for the employer, and ensured that safety standards were upgraded.\n\nAlso in 2021, Ford announced it needed to shut production in the state. The Tamil Nadu government recognised market realities and helped Ford exit by resolving complex labour and land issues. That experience convinced Ford that risks of doing business there were low. So when the company decided this year to make a new investment in India, it again chose the southern state. The concept that easy exits incentivise enthusiastic entry has not been easy for Indian policymakers to grasp.\n\nIf India is to develop its manufacturing sector, this Tamil Nadu experience must be replicated in the poorer, populous heartland states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, with their cheaper labour pools. To be sure, the governance challenges will be immense and India\u2019s geopolitical window will not remain open forever. But the model is there for emulation.\n\nJosh Felman of Principal JH Consulting contributed to this article", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fc56385d-ceed-4dee-9e5e-017a708d37c9"}, {"uuid4": "1e07f83d-ac83-4bc6-930e-e6a75787a4bb", "title": "Indian investors lukewarm over Swiggy\u2019s $1.3bn listing", "description": "The food delivery app\u2019s IPO has landed during a backdrop of dismal earnings across the corporate subcontinent", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2024-11-10T05:00:25.916Z", "content": "Trading in Indian food delivery app Swiggy begins on Wednesday in a $1.3bn initial public offering that investors have already given a lukewarm reception, as it tries to grow in a fiercely competitive sector.\n\nOn Friday, institutional investors shored up Swiggy\u2019s listing on its final subscription day as the Bengaluru-based company chased a valuation of about $11.2bn.\n\nSwiggy\u2019s listing \u2014 India\u2019s second-largest this year \u2014 received bids more than three times the shares on offer, with the retail portion just covered.\n\nIt is one of a glut of Indian companies that rushed to list and capitalise on elevated valuations this year as the country\u2019s stock market soared.\n\nBut Swiggy\u2019s IPO, with early backers including Tencent and venture capital fund Accel cashing out, has landed against a backdrop of dismal earnings across corporate India. The benchmark Nifty 50 index has fallen 3.5 per cent over the past month with foreign investors dumping a record $11.2bn of Indian equities in October.\n\nIt comes just weeks after Hyundai\u2019s tepid $3.3bn float of its Indian business, which was Asia\u2019s largest IPO this year. While Swiggy slightly outperformed Hyundai\u2019s ratios, it was underwhelming compared to earlier Indian sales that drew in fevered buying from local investors.\n\nOperating in more than 600 cities in India, Swiggy\u2019s losses widened 8 per cent to Rs6.1bn ($72mn) in the three months through June from a year earlier, as it faces strong competition from the industry\u2019s profitable and dominant market leader Zomato, as well as newer challengers such as Zepto.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still some time away before Swiggy reports a strong performance,\u201d said Karan Taurani, a Mumbai-based analyst at Elara Capital. He added that the company\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d valuation at a roughly 60 per cent discount to Zomato leaves little \u201cupside\u201d ahead of its Wednesday debut.\n\nDecade-old Swiggy pioneered ultrafast delivery services in India, serving groceries within 20 minutes in the country\u2019s crowded cities. That business accounts for 40 per cent of the app\u2019s food delivery sales and Swiggy has built out more than 500 local warehouses known as dark stores to enable a fast churn of small-volume orders in a tight radius.\n\nSome analysts and local fund managers had warned that despite a surge in domestic investment among households, the IPO boom that saw India become the world\u2019s largest listing market outside the US would struggle to be sustained by local bidders.\n\n\u201cThere is concern about the IPO market\u201d, said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, the Singapore-based head of consumer and internet at Aletheia Capital, an advisory group focused on Asia.\n\nConsumer goods companies in India are struggling with weakening demand in the country\u2019s cities as stubborn inflation and a retail credit crackdown by the central bank hits the spending power of middle-class Indians.\n\nAt a press conference last month, Swiggy\u2019s chief executive Sriharsha Majety dismissed signs of consumer strife. \u201cAt this point we have not been seeing that, the businesses have been demonstrating strong growth,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Indian delivery sector has seen several high-profile casualties in recent years, such as Uber Eats and local courier app Dunzo. The latter collapsed this year despite backing from Reliance Industries, the Indian conglomerate owned by Mukesh Ambani, Asia\u2019s richest man.\n\nSwiggy has \u201clagged\u201d Zomato, which went public in 2021, in both food delivery and quick commerce, according to Axis Capital. In response, Swiggy has earmarked about Rs12bn from the IPO proceeds to expand its dark store network, which feeds its rapid commerce arm operating in more than 30 cities.\n\nWhile still a small part of India\u2019s overall retail landscape, quick commerce has experienced explosive growth. Indian investment bank JM Financial predicts the industry could surge to $40bn by the end of the decade, driven by increasing urban demand for affordable and convenient delivery services.\n\n\u201cThe food delivery business is, pun intended, delivering profits in other markets,\u201d said Tiruchelvam, pointing to the success and scale of China\u2019s biggest delivery platform Meituan.\n\n\u201cOne is bullish about the asset class in a mass market like India where smartphone penetration is expanding and infrastructure for food delivery is improving.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/431d03f7-cab6-4214-9cc9-6c3a8ef9de96"}, {"uuid4": "6a21e612-db01-404c-b0a3-5f597bd33790", "title": "Foreign investors fear India\u2019s stock market boom may be over", "description": "International investors pull out more than $10bn from Indian stocks as indices record largest fall since March 2020", "author": "Joseph Cotterill", "published_date": "2024-11-04T04:16:36.680Z", "content": "Foreign investors pulled more than $10bn out of Indian stocks in October, the biggest monthly exodus since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, on growing concerns that the market\u2019s huge bull run may finally be coming to an end as the economy slows.\n\nIndia\u2019s two main share indices last month posted their worst monthly losses since March 2020 while the rupee fell close to a record low against the US dollar, as international interest cools in what was one of the hottest global markets.\n\nInvestors increasingly fear that Indian shares, which have more than tripled since March 2020, could now struggle in the face of weak corporate earnings, signs of an economic slowdown and moves by the central bank to curb exuberant retail lending.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty classic cyclical economic downturn in India,\u201d said Saurabh Mukherjea, chief investment officer at Marcellus Investment Managers in Mumbai.\n\n\u201cThe question is if it\u2019s a few quarters or a more prolonged affair,\u201d said Mukherjea. He has been buying defensive stocks in sectors such as information technology and pharmaceuticals, which he believes will perform in \u201ctimes of uncertainty\u201d.\n\nInvestors have also sold down their positions to brace for volatility around the US elections and to free up money to chase the recent stimulus-driven rally in Chinese shares.\n\nFollowing October\u2019s outflow, net inflows from foreign investors for this year have dropped to just $2bn, according to stock exchange data. Even as money was still coming in earlier this year, foreign ownership of India\u2019s stock market dropped to a 12-year low amid an Indian retail investor frenzy for shares.\n\nA warning sign came in August with data showing that Indian GDP grew 6.7 per cent in the three months to June, its slowest rate in five quarters. India\u2019s \u201cgrowth glass looks half-empty\u201d, said Nomura economists last month.\n\nAfter hitting a series of record highs this year, the Nifty 50 index of blue-chip Indian stocks fell 6.2 per cent in October. The Sensex meanwhile fell 5.8 per cent, its worst month since March 2020. Even so, the MSCI India trades at 24 times forward earnings, just ahead of the roughly 23 times for the US\u2019s S&P 500 index.\n\nAlso driving stocks lower is a wide swath of Indian industry reporting sluggish earnings, with misses so far exceeding earnings beats, according to Goldman Sachs, whose analysts have lowered their rating on the country\u2019s equities from \u201coverweight\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe track the extent of downgrades on earnings. What we are seeing in India is fairly intense. Even [some] consumer staples are missing numbers,\u201d said Sunil Tirumalai, chief emerging markets strategist at UBS.\n\nData has indicated consumer confidence is slowing; Indian vehicle sales have dipped in recent months, while bellwethers such as Hindustan Unilever, the seller of Dove soap and Cornetto ice cream, had \u201cmuted\u201d industry-wide demand growth, chief financial officer Ritesh Tiwari told analysts.\n\nAn inflection point for the glut of Indian companies coming to market in 2024 came with the highly symbolic $3.3bn listing of Hyundai\u2019s Indian business on local stock bourses in October. Asia\u2019s largest float this year was poorly received by retail investors, who were put off by its elevated valuation and an industry-wide vehicle sales slowdown.\n\nExecutives at Citigroup, one of Hyundai\u2019s Indian bookrunners, nevertheless defended the listing and played down fears of a wider downturn.\n\n\u201cA temporary softness of one season or two months is not necessarily determining what our view on the outlook is for 2025,\u201d Rahul Saraf, head of India investment banking at Citi, told reporters last month.\n\nOther \u201clarge\u201d clients are \u201cvery keen\u201d to explore an Indian IPO, he added. \u201cI think they\u2019re actually encouraged with the listing of Hyundai [rather] than being discouraged.\u201d\n\nThe cooling in sentiment also comes as China\u2019s battered stock market enjoyed a stimulus-driven revival. Many overseas investors had been bullish on India while keeping positions in China low. But when Chinese stocks soared on news of the stimulus, many reduced Indian holdings to increase their bets on China or miss out on the rally.\n\nBut this shift would have limits, said Ashish Chugh, head of global emerging market equities at Loomis Sayles. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the stimulus is going to solve the long-term problem of painful debt restructuring\u201d given how much China\u2019s economy came to rely on borrowing for investment, he said.\n\nIndia\u2019s rally over the past year has been driven primarily by domestic investors ploughing bank deposits and household savings into the country\u2019s burgeoning public markets, but foreign investors may be growing concerned that even local risk appetite is close to saturation.\n\n\u201c[Local] retail money that is coming into the market is still supportive. But there are signs that you\u2019re actually reaching some limits on that,\u201d said UBS\u2019s Tirumalai.\n\nMuch now depends on whether Indian authorities take action to prevent a potential multiyear economic downturn, said Marcellus\u2019s Mukherjea. While the Reserve Bank of India has indicated it is open to easing its 6.5 per cent key policy rate, governor Shaktikanta Das has stated that a rate cut now would be too risky.\n\nGiven inflation is close to 6 per cent, the RBI \u201cfaces a tough call, but I think they need to start cutting rates sooner rather than later\u201d, Mukherjea added. \u201cProvided there is appropriate monetary and fiscal action, we should snap out of this by Christmas 2025.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d7ba1339-5326-4265-a360-04574a9239c0"}, {"uuid4": "a834f5db-a484-4b06-ae11-1cf63c39134b", "title": "Adani begins to cut off power supplies to Bangladesh", "description": "Indian conglomerate threatens to halt flows from coal-fired plant over debt dispute", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2024-11-03T11:45:26.913Z", "content": "The Indian conglomerate Adani Group has begun to curb electricity supplies to Bangladesh and threatened to completely shut down power exports as the new government in Dhaka struggles with a backlog of overdue payments.\n\nThe infrastructure-focused company owned by billionaire Gautam Adani on Thursday started slashing cross-border electricity flows by as much as half from its 1,600-megawatt capacity Godda coal-fired plant in eastern India, according to data published by Bangladesh\u2019s power grid.\n\nThe group has set a November 7 deadline for a full cut-off unless Bangladesh can clarify how it will settle amounts owed to the company, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAdani Group has previously warned that the overdue payments have become \u201cunsustainable\u201d.

He was later discharged by India\u2019s top court for a lack of evidence.\n\nShah has remained one of Modi\u2019s closest advisers, and is seen as having been behind some of the BJP government\u2019s most controversial policies, including the revocation of special autonomous status for Jammu and Kashmir, India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state.", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/732b6e93-b0ae-4051-bc34-3adb1a118f9f"}, {"uuid4": "ca415d43-369d-491c-ac6b-8b44197e8def", "title": "Adani Enterprises profit rockets on growing airports and green business", "description": "Quarterly results boost Gautam Adani\u2019s conglomerate as it seeks to bounce back from damaging allegations", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2024-10-29T14:11:41.737Z", "content": "Adani Enterprises, the flagship business incubator owned by Indian tycoon Gautam Adani, posted a more than seven-fold surge in quarterly profit fuelled by accelerated expansion in green energy and airports that offset weaker earnings from coal trading.\n\nThe eponymous infrastructure-focused company\u2019s shares closed 1.6 per cent higher on Tuesday after it reported 663 per cent year-on-year growth in net profit to Rs17.4bn ($207mn) for the three months through September.\n\nIts billionaire chair attributed the performance to \u201crapid growth\u201d in the conglomerate\u2019s airport division, which is India\u2019s largest private operator, as well as at Adani New Industries, its green hydrogen and renewable manufacturing business. The two branches contributed about a third of the company\u2019s profit before interest and tax.\n\nPre-tax profits at Adani Enterprises\u2019 coal-supplying unit declined 30 per cent amid a similar fall in volumes. Electricity demand in India dipped 2.3 per cent on an annual basis in the quarter, according to S&P Global-owned Indian rating agency Crisil.\n\nAdani\u2019s combination of green energy investment with its coal business mirrors India\u2019s drive to have half its energy come from renewable sources by 2030, while still extensively using the abundant and dirty fossil fuel at its disposal to meet ballooning long-term demand for electricity.\n\nAdani has publicly tethered his nation-spanning infrastructure empire to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s goal of turning India into a developed country by 2047.

Concerts take place at sunrise, moonrise and throughout the day in its gardens, courtyards and sumptuous rooms. \u201cWe\u2019re a destination festival,\u201d says artistic director Divya Bhatia. \u201cYou need to be here to experience it and it\u2019s timed to coincide with Sharad Purnima, the brightest full Moon of the year.\u201d\n\nA sunrise concert on a high plateau near the fort starts at 5.30am, the pre-dawn sky dark, the musicians barely visible. As the Moon recedes, glowing like a sunset, the five players become silhouettes. Then the sun catches their red turbans while the air grows noticeably warmer.\n\nThe first group are Meghwals from the local weaving community of the Marwar region around Jodhpur. Specialising in meditative Hindu prayers or bhajans, the singers are Hindu, but the accompanying musicians are Muslim. As the dawn progresses, the music gradually increases in pace \u2014 powerful vocals accompanied by a plucked lute, small hand cymbals, and the irregular rhythms of a dholak drum, played on each end of the instrument.\n\nNext comes a troupe of Manganiyar, a hereditary musician community in Rajasthan celebrated for its virtuosity. The players are Muslim, but sing songs for their Hindu patrons \u2014 the state is rich in this syncretic music that transcends religious boundaries. By the time the concert ends at 7.30am, the day is already hot and the Mehrangarh fort in the background blazes orange in the sunshine.\n\nThe five-day Jodhpur RIFF, now in its 17th edition, is hosted by the Mehrangarh Museum Trust and its chair, Maharaja Gaj Singh II, hereditary ruler of Marwar (Jodhpur state). India\u2019s maharajas were stripped of their titles, privileges and privy purse in 1971, yet Bapji, as he is affectionately known, commands huge respect, with people touching his feet when they encounter him.\n\nAs a fan of Rajasthan\u2019s music, when Gaj Singh married in 1973 he arranged for a group of local Langa musicians \u2014 another hereditary community \u2014 to play in both Jodhpur and Delhi. \u201cI feared they might be the last surviving group of musicians, but I took them to Delhi to give them more exposure and they were very well received,\u201d he says.\n\nPre-independence, musicians would have played for the Maharaja at a huge number of royal and religious events, but now his resources are much diminished. So while there is support from the trust, there is also a greater reliance on tourism and ticket sales. \u201cTourism can help, but it is a double-edged sword,\u201d Gaj Singh says. \u201cIt can earn musicians a living, but at the same time it dilutes the authenticity. You have an audience that doesn\u2019t understand the music so it becomes limited.\u201d\u00a0When local musicians are playing to tourists they tend to concentrate on a small selection of familiar pieces that get a good response, rather than sustaining the deeper repertoire.\n\nRajasthan is India\u2019s largest state, and has an incredibly rich diversity of music and instruments, though with urbanisation and digitalisation traditional musicians are suffering. This was one of the reasons for the founding of RIFF, which has since broadened its remit to include musicians from other parts of India and abroad \u2014 more than 400 performers this year.\n\nAmong the highlights are two instrumentalists: Asin Khan and Dilshad Khan, on sarangi, one of Rajasthan\u2019s most sublime stringed instruments, played with a bow. A speciality of the Langa, it has three playing strings, but also 20 or so sympathetic strings, which resonate behind the melody and lend the instrument a haunting, ethereal aura.\n\nAsin Khan plays in a folk style, Dilshad Khan in a classical manner. The folk sarangi is the original while the classical instrument was developed in the 20th century. Sultan Khan, who died in 2011, was one of the latter\u2019s most celebrated players and Dilshad Khan\u2019s principal teacher. The classical sarangi is larger, more resonant and is played with a song-like lyricism. The folk sarangi is more earthy and free from the complex raga structures that classical musicians have to follow. What makes the performance so engrossing is hearing two masters playing the same instrument in two different styles, making the enormous potential of the sarangi apparent in a very focused way.\n\nAsin Khan lives in a village about 60km from Jodhpur, whereas Dilshad Khan spends most of his time in Mumbai, and though they hadn\u2019t played together until recently, they meet as equals. Indeed, part of RIFF\u2019s success has been in giving folk musicians the respect they deserve. The Maharaja admits that, in former times, folk musicians were at the bottom of the pecking order and many of them wouldn\u2019t have been allowed into the fort.\n\n\u201cThe festival is a force against feudalism, casteism and religious communalism,\u201d adds Bhatia. \u201cAnd to make people see the value of this music \u2014 most will never have heard anything like it, and most of the visitors are from India.\u201d The festival also attracts a healthy number of foreigners \u2014 some 15-20 per cent of the approximately 3,500 people who attend each evening concert.\n\nAmong the Rajasthani musicians in the final concert was Sumitra Das Goswami, performing wedding songs from the female point of view, rarely heard outside of a wedding. \u201cRIFF is a huge platform for folk artists of Rajasthan, who are scattered in many different villages across the state,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of artists were discovered here and have made it abroad.\u201d Sumitra is one of them, having recorded and performed with Laura Marling and Mumford & Sons at concerts in London and Bradford.\n\nRIFF also has its international performers, with musicians from Norway, Estonia, Azerbaijan, Mauritius and Korea. Among the highlights are Estonia\u2019s Puuluup (\u201cWood Loop\u201d), a brilliant duo reviving the talharpa \u2014 a moribund plucked and bowed Estonian folk instrument \u2014 with looper pedals and electronics. They were part of Estonia\u2019s Eurovision entry earlier this year, where their sophisticated music and irrepressible wit ensured they scored pretty badly. But at RIFF they are crowd favourites, the audience warming to their inventive, folk-derived music and amusing stage presence, and dancing in a frenzy in a palace courtyard well beyond midnight.\n\nThe Maharaja tells me that, as well as faithfully preserving tradition, he feels RIFF should be stimulating the creation of new Rajasthani music. Perhaps Puuluup can be an inspiration.\n\njodhpurriff.org", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/144c517b-0dc4-49df-8522-0b5487f5b597"}, {"uuid4": "a37f8d12-689f-4183-8fc4-c7589d626f4d", "title": "Xi Jinping\u2019s meeting with Narendra Modi signals China-India thaw", "description": "Formal encounter at Brics summit is leaders\u2019 first in five years and follows deal on patrols along disputed border", "author": "Joe Leahy", "published_date": "2024-10-23T14:51:45.890Z", "content": "Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi, the Chinese and Indian leaders, have held their first formal bilateral meeting in five years, marking an apparent thaw in relations between the neighbouring nuclear-armed states.\n\nThe meeting, at the leaders\u2019 summit of Brics nations in Kazan, Russia, on Wednesday, came days after the two countries announced an agreement on patrols along their disputed border, the site of deadly clashes four years ago.\n\nThe Chinese president used his meeting with India\u2019s prime minister to urge co-operation between their nations as \u201ctwo major developing countries and important members of the global south\u201d, state news agency Xinhua reported.\n\nChina and India should \u201cproperly handle\u201d differences and \u201cset an example\u201d for other developing countries to unite and promote \u201cthe multipolarisation of the world and the democratisation of international relations\u201d, Xi said.\n\n\u201cThe two leaders affirmed that stable, predictable and amicable bilateral relations between India and China, as two neighbours and the two largest nations on earth, will have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity,\u201d India said in a communique.\n\nThe two countries this week said they had reached an agreement on patrolling arrangements along their almost 3,500km disputed border in the Himalayas, known as the Line of Actual Control.\n\nTroops from both sides clashed in hand-to-hand fighting in and around the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh in 2020, leaving at least 24 dead and prompting the Modi government to impose strict limits on Chinese foreign direct investment.\n\nSince then, both countries each sent more than 50,000 troops to the border and bolstered roads and other infrastructure in the area, with India saying it would not restore normal relations with China unless \u201cpeace and tranquillity\u201d were restored along the LAC.\n\nIn its communique, India said special representatives would meet soon to \u201coversee the management of peace and tranquillity in border areas and to explore a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution to the boundary question\u201d.\n\nDetails have not been released of what the two sides agreed in their pact on patrols and some analysts in India have expressed doubt that it is a substantial breakthrough.\n\n\u201cI think it will be India\u2019s major mistake if we feel that the India-China relationship will be back to where it was pre-Galwan just by having this agreement on patrolling,\u201d said Namrata Hasija, a research fellow at the Centre for China Analysis and Strategy in New Delhi. \u201cChina is very good at optics.\u201d\n\nThe two countries\u2019 relations plumbed new lows last year when Xi abruptly announced he would not attend a G20 summit in New Delhi. Analysts in China said the snub was because India had held G20 side meetings in the run-up to the summit in the disputed region of Kashmir, which is also claimed by Pakistan, and in Arunachal Pradesh, an Indian state in the Himalayas that China claims as its own.\n\nDespite the diplomatic chill, China has surpassed the US as India\u2019s biggest source of imports, with a large deficit in Beijing\u2019s favour. Some Modi government officials and advisers have favoured easing limits on foreign direct investment and visas for Chinese nationals, which business groups say are impeding India\u2019s push to become a major \u201cChina plus one\u201d manufacturing nation.\n\nLin Minwang, a professor at the Centre for South Asian Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said that during its development, China had run large trade deficits with advanced manufacturing economies such as Japan.\n\n\u201cIf India wants to make much progress in manufacturing, they have to have strong trade with China because China provides low-cost intermediary and capital goods, which will reduce the burden for Indian industrialisation,\u201d Lin said.\n\nChina\u2019s emphasis on a \u201cmultipolar\u201d world is seen by analysts as code for its agenda of eroding US global dominance and creating more room for its own emergence as a superpower.\n\nXi is keen to use groupings such as the Brics to promote his agenda of creating an alternative world order, even though it includes democracies such as India and Brazil that have better relations with Washington.", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8e401438-5c6b-401e-b49b-e88dff54e40e"}, {"uuid4": "3a83e631-252c-4963-b07b-9062ac469922", "title": "To keep, or not to keep books\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009", "description": "That is the question that eventually faces all booklovers when the ever-growing stacks around the house threaten to fall", "author": "Nilanjana Roy", "published_date": "2024-10-22T11:00:15.107Z", "content": "Every reader knows the moment when the paths of destiny fork. You must either become a Chucker, steel your nerves and give away old books before they march into the linen cupboards and storm the sofas, the dining table, the guest room, or become a Keeper, accept defeat and move to a larger home, just to accommodate the relentless tide of a personal library gone rogue.This is a fraught issue, as the late French novelist Georges Perec wrote in \u201cBrief Notes on the Art and Manner of Arranging One\u2019s Books\u201d, his classic 1978 essay: \u201cBut for us, who continue to have to do with a\u00a0human race that insists on thinking, writing, and above all publishing, the increasing size of our libraries tends to become the one real problem.\u201dNote the neat reversal of responsibility \u2014 every true bibliophile believes, hand on heart, that they are not to blame for the steady accumulation of books in the house. I personally suspect that the volumes piled up everywhere in my own home, these paper towers of Babel that threaten to topple on the heads of unwary guests, have sneaked in from a parallel universe, multiplying the moment you take your eye off them. My husband and I have a modest collection of roughly 4,000 tomes, and yet we\u2019re wading in up to our necks: how many is too many?\n\nThe novelist Hanya Yanagihara houses 12,000 books in double-sided bookcases that act as a wall; Umberto Eco, the late medievalist and author, arranged his living spaces around 44,000 books and another 1,200 antique volumes; the hugely popular British food writer Nigella Lawson has amassed a collection of more than 6,000, many of them cookbooks. And I take heart from the example of Bhimrao Ambedkar, the great anti-caste reformer who drafted India\u2019s Constitution \u2014 his personal library ran to 50,000 volumes, at that time one of the largest private libraries in the world.\u00a0A simple principle emerges: intention matters. Booklovers who organise their lives and their homes around their desire to have a research library at hand are seldom overwhelmed in the manner of us amateurs who buy books on impulse, letting a library grow over time.\n\nAmbedkar is said to have built his home, Rajgruha in Bombay (now Mumbai), over three storeys specifically to accommodate his books, with ample room to add more during his lifetime. Eco\u2019s vast collection is now in Italy\u2019s Bologna University, except for 1,200 antique books sent to Milan\u2019s Braidense Library, and is arranged in the precise order in which he\u2019d kept them at home. And the late designer Karl Lagerfeld left instructions for the future maintenance of his 33,000 volumes. \u201cBooks are sufficient to themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey ask for nothing and they are silently patient, but they are always there for you.\u201d\n\nThat said, not all collections have a happy future. In The Diary of a Bookseller, Shaun Bythell, owner of The Bookshop, the largest second-hand bookshop in Scotland, chronicles the fate of books once loved, now unwanted by inheritors and family members. He salvages what he can, inspects collections in the libraries of great country houses. And he explains to optimists who show up at his store with worn editions of Dickens that not all old books are worth much beyond sentimental value. Similarly, in the auction houses of Kolkata on Russel Street, and in the busy second-hand book market in New Delhi\u2019s Daryaganj, painstakingly acquired collections are hawked for less than a few pounds, or sold by the kilo.\n\nOver three decades, I went from being a Keeper, determined to cherish every last bequest, gift and purchase because it seemed like a truer record of my changing interests and passions than even a diary, to being a gentle but firm Chucker. I tried and failed at some of the \u201crules\u201d of letting go of old books \u2014 Marie Kondo\u2019s suggestion that you discard what doesn\u2019t spark joy is useless when you have fond memories of much of your collection, and the sage dictum to give away a book for every one you buy only works for the most organised among us.\u00a0Instead, I take my cue from gardeners, pruning and weeding our collection every few years, giving hundreds of books away to friends or small libraries. Some books will never go \u2014 my grandmother\u2019s collection of romances, copies autographed by writers, the old, tattered friends I passionately love. But every reader outgrows their own reading, in time. I would rather those books were in the hands of others who will care for them, turn their pages, give them an honoured space on their shelves. The tower on the desk is Eiffelesque; my husband\u2019s study should bear a sign warning friends to enter at their own risk; time for another cull.

At a regular press briefing in Beijing on Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian reiterated that China would work towards \u201cgreater Brics co-operation\u201d and a \u201cnew era for the global south\u201d.\n\nThe potential agreement comes a month after Wang Yi, Xi\u2019s top diplomat, held talks with India\u2019s national security adviser Ajit Doval. Chinese state media said at the time that the two sides had \u201cagreed to work together to create conditions for the improvement of bilateral relations\u201d.\n\nIndia and China fought a major war in 1962, and the almost 3,500km-long LAC, which crosses through some of the world\u2019s highest places in the Himalayas, is one of Asia\u2019s most tense arenas of geopolitical conflict.\n\nChina has built villages along the LAC in Tibet in an effort to bolster its presence there, and India is undertaking a similar effort under its \u201cVibrant Villages\u201d programme.\n\nAfter the clashes in and around Ladakh\u2019s Galwan Valley, both sides each deployed at least 50,000 more troops to the LAC, with India diverting some soldiers there from the areas bordering Pakistan. India\u2019s government complained that areas where its troops formerly patrolled freely had been blocked by their Chinese counterparts.\n\nThe Modi government has since 2020 driven a hard line on the issue, making de-escalation around the LAC a condition of resuming \u201cnormal\u201d relations with Beijing.\n\nDetails of which specific areas were covered by the understanding announced on Monday were not immediately available.\n\nIn the wake of the 2020 violence at the LAC, India banned dozens of Chinese apps and began implementing some of the toughest restrictions on inward investment from China of any country.\n\nBusinesspeople have, however, in recent months complained that the draconian restrictions on Chinese foreign direct investment and the provision of visas to Chinese nationals were slowing India\u2019s drive to develop its manufacturing sector, and some officials inside the Modi government favoured easing them.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ding Wenjie in Beijing", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e2929860-9f34-451b-98b9-c525562778ee"}, {"uuid4": "53625b0f-cafa-4ec7-ac06-d42cee3dc2f7", "title": "Sikh separatist leader vows to keep fighting India from Toronto", "description": "Murder of former Khalistan movement head further sours relations between Trudeau and Modi governments", "author": "Ilya Gridneff", "published_date": "2024-10-21T04:00:20.409Z", "content": "Inderjeet Singh Gosal says he is not afraid to die for an independent Sikh homeland in India\u2019s Punjab region.\n\nThe 35-year-old\u2019s declaration sounds incongruous as he sits in his comfortable home in Toronto\u2019s suburbs. But after the assassination of his predecessor as head of the Khalistan movement, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the risk is real.\n\n\u201cI know what I signed up for, death doesn\u2019t scare me,\u201d Gosal said. \u201cIndia\u2019s threats or any assassination attempts would not stop my effort for\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Khalistan.\u201d\n\nThis week Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, expelled six Indian diplomats, including the high commissioner, because of their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar, who was gunned down in Vancouver in June 2023.\n\nTrudeau on Monday said: \u201cWe will never tolerate the involvement of a foreign government in threatening and killing Canadian citizens on Canadian soil, a deeply unacceptable violation of Canada\u2019s sovereignty and of international law.\u201d\n\nIndia, which sees the Khalistan activists as terrorists, has denied any involvement and expelled six Canadian diplomats in response. It accuses Ottawa of tolerating violent extremism that has cost the lives of its citizens.\n\nIndia has levelled the same accusation at the US. Last week, federal prosecutors charged an Indian government official with orchestrating a plot to murder a Sikh activist in New York City. India has designated that activist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a terrorist under its Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.\n\nThe tit-for-tat expulsions between India and Canada are the latest episode in the increasingly fraught relations between Ottawa and New Delhi over the activities of Canada\u2019s large Sikh community.\n\nThe movement for a sovereign Sikh state called Khalistan dates back to India\u2019s independence from Britain in 1947 and gained momentum after anti-Sikh killings in the wake of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi\u2019s assassination in 1984.\n\nSikhs such as Gosal describe the violence as a \u201cgenocide\u201d that forced thousands to flee India, many to Canada. Some 771,790 Canadians identified as belonging to the Sikh faith in the 2021 census, making it the largest Sikh community outside India.\n\nCanada\u2019s relations with India have soured in recent years as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has become increasingly critical of what he says is Ottawa\u2019s failure to clamp down on Sikh extremism.\n\nThe worst mass murder in Canadian history, the bombing of an Air India flight travelling from Montreal to London in June 1985, has been blamed on Sikh extremists. All 329 people on board were killed. Two pro-Khalistan diaspora Sikhs were charged in the incident but later acquitted.\n\nWhile the majority of Canadian Sikhs are peaceful or not engaged in the Khalistan movement, Ottawa has listed other Sikh groups such as Babbar Khalsa International and the International Sikh Youth Federation as terrorist organisations.\n\nThe rift also highlights the complex nature of diaspora politics in Canada.\n\n\u201cWe are a migrant nation, and diaspora politics is a real facet of Canadian politics,\u201d said Colin Robertson, a former diplomat who is vice-president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute in Ottawa. \u201cThis complicates our foreign policy because you always have to make allowance to minority groups. Sometimes you have to turn a blind eye to extreme views, as it has an impact on various ridings [constituencies].\u201d\n\nIndia has long pleaded with Canada to curb behaviour it considers a terrorist threat and which Ottawa sees as permissible political activism.\n\nPannun admitted to Indian media last year that he posted flyers outside the Sikh temple near Vancouver where Nijjar was killed that read \u201cKill India\u201d and featured names and photos of Indian diplomats.\n\nIn turn, Canada has alleged growing Indian interference in its Sikh communities. That came to a head last year when Trudeau accused the Modi government of being involved in the fatal shooting of Nijjar.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Monday warned Canadians about suspected Indian involvement in \u201cserious criminal activity\u201d, including drive-by shootings, home invasions, violent extortion and even murder. The Indian government denies any involvement.\n\nA public inquiry that has been running since last year has also heard evidence that India directly interfered in Canada\u2019s 2019 and 2021 general elections.\n\nFormer Canadian intelligence agent Phil Gurski said the inquiry highlighted how Trudeau\u2019s government had either ignored, played down or repeatedly missed warnings of foreign meddling in Canadian life, whether political or in diaspora communities.\n\n\u201cCanada\u2019s intelligence community is not happy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been saying this for a while.\u201d\n\nGurski said Canada was caught between global pressures from superpowers China and India, and local politics and security concerns. It is also aware India is strategically important for the Five Eyes alliance of the US, Canada, the UK, New Zealand and Australia.\n\n\u201cThe political power of Sikh diaspora is real,\u201d he said. \u201cTrudeau could kiss the Sikh vote goodbye if they did favours for India, like sending a wanted separatist back. Canada does not want to upset the diaspora vote, they rely on it.\u201d\n\nFor Gosal, the claims made last week about Indian government involvement in Nijjar\u2019s death came as no surprise.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was India from the minute they killed Nijjar. We knew there was a threat or it was dangerous, but we didn\u2019t think it would go this far, that they\u2019d kill a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that in February, months after he took over leadership of the Khalistan movement, a bullet was fired into a window at a site run by his construction business. An Indian account on X had posted about the shooting before police arrived.\n\nIn August, local police called him to warn he was the target of a murder plot, he said. \u201cAll this is absolutely tied to the government of India,\u201d said Gosal. \u201cThey are posting tweets about it, openly making threats. They\u2019re not trying to hide it.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/78cf640b-4fe2-4eb3-b85e-1b2596519cc1"}, {"uuid4": "fbac4f60-5ac2-4ca0-8cc5-3e8516799e68", "title": "Indian investors give short shrift to Asia\u2019s biggest IPO of 2024", "description": "Retail share buyers largely shun $3.3bn listing of Korean carmaker Hyundai\u2019s Indian unit as auto industry sales cool", "author": "Song Jung-a", "published_date": "2024-10-21T02:28:47.297Z", "content": "Trading in the world\u2019s second-largest IPO of 2024 begins on Tuesday, but retail investors have already given a lukewarm reception to the $3.3bn listing of Hyundai Motor India, amid a slowdown in car sales in the country.\n\nThe retail segment of the Mumbai offering was only 50 per cent subscribed last week as many baulked at the $19bn valuation for the Korean carmakers\u2019 India unit, despite a publicity blitz that saw wraparound front-page adverts emblazoned across India\u2019s financial newspapers.\n\nBy last Thursday\u2019s cut-off, the Rs278.7bn issue had drawn bids just over two times the amount offered, shored up by institutional investors that had included Singapore\u2019s government, the BlackRock investment company and Fidelity and Vanguard funds.\n\n\u201cThe valuation was very full,\u201d said a senior Mumbai banker, highlighting Hyundai\u2019s pricing at about 26 times the Indian unit\u2019s earnings.

It has included the $782mn IPO of mortgage provider Bajaj Housing Finance, which last month drew bids more than 64 times the shares offered.\n\nSamuel Kerr, head of equity capital markets at Ion Analytics, called Hyundai\u2019s listing \u201canother jewel in the crown after a marvellous year for Indian deal activity\u201d at a time of \u201cdepressed\u201d Asian listing volumes driven by the \u201csignificant economic slowdown in China\u201d.\n\nHyundai, India\u2019s second-largest carmaker with a 14.6 per cent market share after Maruti Suzuki\u2019s near 40 per cent, plans to spend the IPO proceeds on increasing its local presence. It is expanding production capacity for its sport utility vehicle line-up and intends to introduce four EV models.\n\nHyundai has made significant inroads into India compared with other foreign carmakers \u2014 Ford and General Motors have abandoned the market in recent years \u2014 but the listing has coincided with a slowdown in India\u2019s motor industry, with consumers hit by stubborn inflation.\n\nThe Nifty Auto index has fallen 6.9 per cent this month, and Bajaj Auto, one of the country\u2019s biggest sellers of motorcycles, saw its shares plunge 13 per cent after it issued a sales warning on Thursday.\n\nSigns of weaker sales during India\u2019s months-long festival season \u201cdefinitely hampered the situation\u201d, said Abhishek Jain, head of research at Mumbai brokerage Arihant Capital, who added that Hyundai\u2019s offer had been \u201caggressively priced\u201d for such a large IPO.The float marks the first time Hyundai has listed outside its home market and is part of a global push following an erosion of sales in China over the past decade, where it has been hit by the rapid rise of domestic rivals.\n\nHyundai said its Indian unit accounted for about 18 per cent of global sales last year. With 1.4bn people and one of the fastest-growing large economies, India recently overtook Japan as the third-largest car market in the world after China and the US, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.\n\nThe Korean company entered India in 1996 and first began mass producing its compact Santro car two years later. Hyundai now plans to invest $3.8bn in the country over the next decade and expand local capacity to about 1.1mn units by 2028 from 824,000 units now.\n\nHyundai operates two car plants close to the south-eastern city of Chennai and last year it acquired GM\u2019s largely mothballed factory in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. \u201cThey need to expand their capacity in India, given the strong demand growth there,\u201d Yoon Hyuk-jin, an analyst at SK Securities, said in a recent report.\n\nLee Hang-koo at the Jeonbuk Institute of Automotive Convergence Technology, a South Korean research group, said the IPO would help Hyundai narrow the market share gap with Maruti Suzuki, a joint venture set up by the Japanese company and India\u2019s government in 1982.\n\n\u201cHyundai is

scheme from India.\n\nAccording to the DoJ, the plot involved paying a hitman $100,000 for assassinating a US-Canadian citizen who was part of a separatist movement advocating an independent Sikh state.\n\nAlthough prosecutors did not name the target of the foiled plot, the Financial Times last year confirmed it was Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, general counsel for US-based group Sikhs for Justice.\n\nThe Indian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the indictment.\n\nIn charges unsealed on Thursday, prosecutors claimed Yadav \u2014 who is believed to be in India \u2014 had overseen a scheme to kill Pannun, providing his address in New York and his phone numbers to the would-be assassin, who was an undercover US agent.\n\nIn June 2023, Yadav was also allegedly communicating about the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, an associate of Pannun\u2019s and a fellow Sikh activist, in a suburb of Vancouver, Canada.\n\nYadav sent a video of Nijjar\u2019s body to an associate, prosecutors said, and days later forwarded a news article about Pannun, writing: \u201c[I]t\u2019s [a] priority now.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Thursday,

Indian telecom tycoons Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Bharti Mittal over the way satellite spectrum should be awarded, as the billionaires battle over the introduction of space-fed internet to the world\u2019s most populous country.\n\nAmbani, Asia\u2019s richest man and chair of oil-to-digital services conglomerate Reliance Industries, along with Mittal\u2019s Bharti Airtel, have been trying to persuade India\u2019s government to auction satellite spectrum, in line with the usual competitive method in the mobile market they dominate, rather than just allocate it.\n\nMusk, chief executive of SpaceX and owner of the Starlink satellite broadband service, took to his social media site X this week to say that any such moves by India would be \u201cunprecedented, as this spectrum was long designated by the [International Telecommunication Union] as shared spectrum for satellites\u201d. India is a member of the ITU.\n\nSoon after, Mittal voiced his support for the auction process. Addressing a conference in New Delhi, he specifically told Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who sat in the audience, that satellite companies serving urban areas \u201cneed to pay telecom licences like everyone else\u201d.\n\nAmbani\u2019s Reliance had written to the telecoms regulator and the government last week, accusing it of pre-emptively concluding that allocation was the way forward, according to a letter seen by the Financial Times and a person familiar with the matter.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Indian communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said there were no plans afoot to auction space spectrum. \u201cMuch appreciated!\u201d Musk posted on X in response. \u201cWe will do our best to serve the people of India with Starlink.\u201d\n\nThis year, the Financial Times reported that Mittal and Ambani were frontrunners to introduce satellite internet services ahead of Musk\u2019s Starlink, which has yet to receive licences. The Indian businessmen enjoy a near duopoly in telecoms domestically and EY-Parthenon estimates that space broadband is a potential $1bn annual revenue market for the country.\n\n\u201cWe have deep pockets and we can spend money to buy extra spectrum\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009this will keep small players away,\u201d said a person close to Reliance. \u201cIf it is not auction, and allocation, because it\u2019s a new technology, a lot of unwanted players might enter.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s parliament late last year enacted a law that allowed allocation of satellite-based spectrum, instead of the country\u2019s traditional auction method. Last month, the telecoms regulator requested feedback from industry players, with a deadline set for later in October.\n\nBharti Airtel, which plans to launch satellite internet in a joint venture with Anglo-French group Eutelsat OneWeb, said in a statement that operators serving urban areas and retail customers should go through the auction process.\n\nA person close to the company said only services reaching currently unserved communities should be assigned spectrum, to allow for a \u201clevel playing field\u201d after Indian operators invested \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d in terrestrial connections.\n\n\u201cThe local guys are arguing there should be uniformity in the rules,\u201d said Vivekanand Subbaraman, technology analyst at Ambit Capital in Mumbai. \u201cPrincipally, they want these companies to be subject to the same licensing norms, the same spectrum norms.\u201d\n\nHowever, another industry expert described the tussle as an \u201cego battle\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about ensuring that the telecom industry remains in control of the local players rather than foreigners coming in and dictating their agenda,\u201d they said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other explanation, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a scarcity of spectrum, it\u2019s abundant.\u201d\n\nA simple assignment of spectrum may hand Musk\u2019s company, the largest and most successful of its kind, a \u201cfirst-mover advantage\u201d, while an auction process would allow Indian players time to get their products market-ready, said the person close to Reliance.\n\nMusk told Modi last year that he wanted to bring Starlink, which operates more than 6,000 low-orbit satellites, to India to connect remote communities. Musk also has his eye on the long-term potential of India as a location for a Tesla plant, despite cancelling a trip to New Delhi earlier this year to prioritise talks with and focus on its Asian rival China.

Most recently imprisoned in Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s home state of Gujarat, he has been accused by police in Punjab, Mumbai and elsewhere of continuing to plot extortion, murder, and other crimes from behind bars.\n\nOn Monday night in Ottawa, Brigitte Gauvin, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police assistant commissioner, said \u201corganised crime elements\u201d were being used against Sikh Canadians such as the late Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who campaigned for an independent state, or \u201cKhalistan\u201d, in the Punjab region, and was shot dead last year.\n\nShe went on to mention the Bishnoi gang by name, saying: \u201cWe believe that that group is connected to agents of India.\u201d\n\nBishnoi was already a familiar figure to many Indians. He was born in 1993 near the Pakistan border in India\u2019s majority-Sikh Punjab state, one of its main sources of emigrants to Canada, the US and the UK.\n\nHe has been charged in more than three dozen cases, some of which are pending, and convicted of offences including attempted murder and possession of illegal firearms.\n\nDuring Bishnoi\u2019s decade in prison, news reports \u2014 often based on anonymous police sources \u2014 have linked him or his gang members, whose number Indian authorities estimate at 700, with shootings and other crimes. He has given interviews from behind bars, leading to speculation that he has access to phones or other devices in prison.\n\nNow Bishnoi\u2019s group was being named at a press briefing about a murder case in Canada that has inflamed tensions with India, and has stirred disquiet among New Delhi\u2019s western partners, which have been keen to bolster it as a strategic ally against China.\n\nAn Indian government official, who asked not to be named, on Tuesday accused Ottawa of making \u201cvague accusations\u201d and putting the burden of denial on New Delhi, in an apparent response to the Bishnoi claims.\n\n\u201cAt the [Canadian police] press briefing, assertions were made about connections of certain individuals to India,\u201d the official said. \u201cIn no case were specifics provided.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s government has not directly responded to the Canadian police claim about Indian agents using Bishnoi\u2019s syndicate. Bishnoi\u2019s lawyer could not be reached for comment.\n\nBishnoi is frequent fodder for Indian tabloids, and this was the second time this week he made national headlines. On Sunday, an associate of his gang claimed responsibility for the fatal shooting of Baba Siddique, a politician who was close to Bollywood stars in the commercial capital Mumbai.\n\nClaims of possible links between Indian officials and criminals have added further pressure to the diplomatic crisis over Nijjar\u2019s fatal shooting, as officials in Canada and the US investigate claims that the world\u2019s largest democracy sponsors killings overseas.\n\nIndia on Monday rejected what it called \u201cpreposterous imputations\u201d by Canada, and expelled six diplomats, hours after Ottawa deported six Indians including its high commissioner Sanjay Verma. India said its diplomats had left because of fears for their safety.\n\nM\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, said the six had been identified as \u201cpersons of interest\u201d in Nijjar\u2019s killing in a suburb of Vancouver. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadian police found \u201cclear and compelling evidence\u201d that agents of the Indian government were involved in \u201cactivities that pose a significant threat to public safety\u201d.\n\nIn the separate US case, federal prosecutors have charged Indian citizen Nikhil Gupta with conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire in a foiled plot against US-based Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh. They say that scheme was directed by an Indian official. Gupta has pleaded not guilty in the case, which has alarmed Washington.\n\nThe US Department of State on Monday said an Indian committee of inquiry into the alleged murder plot would be visiting Washington from Tuesday. India\u2019s government has denied involvement in the Nijjar killing and the Singh plot, but analysts say its vow to investigate the latter is a reflection of the greater value it places on ties with the US.\n\n\u201cIt is extraordinary for a country that calls itself democratic, and is considered democratic by other countries, to do what they\u2019re accused of doing,\u201d said Priya Chacko, an associate professor of international politics at the University of Adelaide. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you would expect from an authoritarian regime.\u201d\n\nIndian media on Tuesday reported widely on Canada\u2019s linking of the Bishnoi gang with the crimes in Canada. Broadcaster India Today dismissed it as an \u201cold claim\u201d. Modi\u2019s government has accused Canada of harbouring extremist Sikhs and criminal elements in its diaspora population.\n\nBishnoi and his gang have been connected with other violent crimes in India. In April this year, when gunmen fired shots outside Bollywood superstar Salman Khan\u2019s home in an attempt on his life, Indian media connected Bishnoi with the case. He did not claim responsibility, but he had previously been captured on film threatening Khan, saying he would \u201cdefinitely kill him\u201d.\n\nKhan was convicted in 1998 of poaching two blackbucks, an endangered species of antelope; Bishnoi\u2019s community, a religious grouping that practises vegetarianism, views the animal as sacred.\n\nIn 2022 Bishnoi\u2019s name was linked to the assassination of Sidhu Moose Wala, a Punjabi singer.

New Delhi announced it was expelling six Canadian diplomats, including Stewart Wheeler, Canada\u2019s deputy high commissioner, asking them to leave by Saturday.\n\nA senior Canadian police officer said there were \u201clinks tying Indian government agents to homicides and violent acts\u201d directed at Sikh supporters of an independent \u201cKhalistan\u201d in the Punjab region, which is split between India and Pakistan. New Delhi considers the activists to be terrorists.\n\nMike Duheme, commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), suggested the activity went beyond Nijjar\u2019s assassination. He said there had been \u201cwell over a dozen credible and imminent threats to life, which had led law enforcement agencies to warn members of the south Asian community and specifically members of the pro-Khalistan movement\u201d.\n\nTrudeau said there was evidence Indian government agents were involved in activities that included \u201cclandestine information gathering techniques, coercive behaviour targeting south Asian Canadians, and involvement in over a dozen threatening and violent acts, including murder\u201d.\n\nA Canadian government official said Verma and five other diplomats had been informed that they were \u201cpersona non grata\u201d, effective on Monday morning.\n\nTrudeau on Monday described India\u2019s actions as a \u201cdeeply unacceptable violation of Canada\u2019s sovereignty and international law\u201d. He said he had raised the matter with Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, and had \u201cimpressed upon him that it needs to be taken very very seriously\u201d.\n\nDuheme, the police commissioner, said the Canadian force had investigated and charged \u201ca significant number\u201d of individuals for their involvement in homicides, extortion and other criminal acts of violence.\n\nNew Delhi said it reserved the right to take \u201cfurther steps\u201d in response to what it called \u201cthe Trudeau government\u2019s support for extremism, violence and separatism against India\u201d.\n\nTrudeau caused an uproar in India last year when he said Canada was investigating \u201ccredible allegations\u201d that Indian agents might have been behind the assassination of Nijjar, who campaigned for the creation of an independent \u201cKhalistan\u201d.\n\nThe accusations, combined with a US criminal case brought against suspects in an alleged murder plot against Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US-Canadian Sikh separatist, shone a light on claims of alleged official targeting of diaspora activists whom India considers terrorists.\n\nIndia has rejected allegations of government involvement in Nijjar\u2019s killing and the attempt on Pannun\u2019s life.\n\nCanadian authorities in May arrested and charged three Indian nationals with Nijjar\u2019s shooting. The RCMP said at the time it was investigating whether there were any ties to the government of India, adding that others might have been involved in the killing.\n\nWheeler told reporters in New Delhi: \u201cThe government of Canada has done what India has long been asking for, and Canada has provided credible, irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the government of India and a murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.\u201d\n\nJoly confirmed in a statement that Monday\u2019s expulsions were because of \u201ca targeted campaign against Canadian citizens by agents linked to the government of India\u201d.\n\nIndia rejected what it said were \u201cpreposterous\u201d and \u201cludicrous\u201d allegations against its diplomats, and attacked Trudeau personally.\n\n\u201cHis cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India,\u201d the ministry of external affairs said.\n\nVerma could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe diplomatic dispute over Nijjar\u2019s killing has brought relations between India and Canada to a low point, with New Delhi expelling most Canadian diplomats and temporarily suspending visa services last year.\n\nIndian officials have accused the Trudeau government of pandering to Sikh voters with views New Delhi considers extreme, in what it has called \u201cvote bank politics\u201d.", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7280dc0c-51bf-45cc-a277-7f4a1d87c599"}, {"uuid4": "3325443c-a48e-4240-b649-06b853b18be5", "title": "While Europe frets, India expects", "description": "European foreboding about peace and stability in the world finds little echo in New Delhi ", "author": "Gideon Rachman", "published_date": "2024-10-14T11:02:42.962Z", "content": "I never used to look at airline route maps too closely. But now, when I journey from one peaceful country to another, I take a keener interest in where exactly we are flying over.\n\nOn a flight from London to New Delhi last week, I noticed with incredulity that the route map suggested that we were passing between Donetsk in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. The flight then took us over Russia (this was Air India), then just north of Iran, then over Afghanistan \u2014 and finally on to India.\n\nJournalists like to talk about \u201ctrouble spots\u201d. But the journey from western Europe to India felt like a trip between two \u201csafe spots\u201d separated by a sea of troubles.\n\nHow long can the world\u2019s safe spots keep the sea of troubles at bay? And what is the best strategy for preserving the peace and prosperity of countries that are living on the edge of regions at war?\n\nI\u2019ve encountered different answers to those questions on three trips I\u2019ve made over the past month \u2014 to Germany, to Bulgaria and now to India.\n\nIn Germany, there was a stark division of opinion. Boris Pistorius, the country\u2019s defence minister, has warned that Russia could attack a Nato country within five to eight years. Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, a prominent member of the Christian Democratic opposition, argues that the best way to prevent that happening is to defeat Russia in Ukraine. He wants to see much more military aid for Kyiv and a dramatic increase in German defence spending.\n\nBut the parties of the German far right and far left \u2014 which now account for about 30 per cent of the electorate \u2014 argue that it is not Russia but the US and Nato that threaten the peace of Europe. They want to give up on Ukraine and to reach out to the Russians.\n\nThat school of thought is also increasingly prominent in Bulgaria. One pro-Nato Bulgarian politician laments: \u201cWe have lost the word \u2018peace\u2019 to the pro-Russian forces.\u201d Bulgarian liberals fear that it is not just rhetorical battles that they may lose in their struggle with pro-Putin populists. With the country heading for its seventh election in three years, the prestige of Bulgarian democracy is declining. Liberals fear their country could be vulnerable to the appeal of a pro-Russian strongman, like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The gains for Bulgarian democracy and sovereignty made after 1989 feel newly fragile.\n\nThe population of Bulgaria is roughly 20 per cent of that of the Indian capital alone. India\u2019s sheer size and its distance from the frontline mean that its elites wave away suggestions that a victorious Putin would threaten their own security.\n\nAmerican, Japanese and European policymakers have made frequent efforts to persuade their Indian counterparts that a Russian victory in Ukraine would embolden China \u2014 whose forces killed Indian troops in a border clash in 2020. But the conventional wisdom in New Delhi is still that India needs a strong Russia to balance China.\n\nIn much of the global south, western arguments about Russian aggression and war crimes are rejected as hypocritical, given America\u2019s unstinting support for Israel. But while Modi\u2019s India sees itself as a leader of the global south, the country views the Middle East very differently. Shekhar Gupta, a prominent Indian journalist, observes that there is an \u201coverwhelming pro-Israel mood among the majority in India\u201d. One prominent member of the governing BJP told me: \u201cThe average party footsoldier is all for Israel bombing the hell out of Muslim terrorists.\u201d India has abstained on several UN resolutions condemning Israel and continues to be an enthusiastic buyer of Israeli weaponry and technology.\n\nTo the extent that Indians feel threatened by the spreading war in the Middle East, their main concerns are a rise in oil prices, an upsurge in Islamist militancy at home and risks to Indians working in the Gulf. The safety of Indian troops serving with the UN in Lebanon may soon be added to that list.\n\nEven the threat posed by China has an upside for India. The country stands to benefit, as western multinationals try to diversify away from China and lessen dependence on Chinese technology. That effort received official backing with the launch of a US-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology \u2014 deepening co-operation between the two countries on a range of areas including space, semiconductors and artificial intelligence.\n\nRising geopolitical tensions are seen as a business and strategic opportunity for India. As a result, the sense of foreboding about the direction of the world that is so evident in Europe and in liberal America is strikingly absent in official Indian circles.\n\nAre Indians wrong to feel largely protected from the conflicts and tensions in the wider world?\n\nOne disquieting possibility that should concern them is the risk that various regional conflicts could become increasingly entangled. They already touch each other at various points. Russia and China have conducted joint air patrols near Alaska and the Sea of Japan. Iran has supplied weapons to Russia. If Israel attacks Iran, Russia might return the favour or seek to profit in other ways. With the western alliance distracted by conflicts elsewhere, China might see a chance to up the pressure in Asia.\n\nIf the conflicts in Europe, the Middle East and Asia begin to merge, the world\u2019s sea of troubles will soon be lapping on India\u2019s shores.\n\ngideon.rachman@ft.com", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8f7a2f2d-fcf1-42da-b65c-15d80dbad291"}, {"uuid4": "0fca739c-556a-49f6-9124-e4f7732a6bb2", "title": "India\u2019s copycat drugmakers gear up to offer cheaper weight-loss drugs", "description": "Expiry of Novo Nordisk\u2019s UK patent for Saxenda seen as offering a \u2018dry run\u2019 for future generic versions of Ozempic ", "author": "Ian Johnston", "published_date": "2024-10-13T04:00:40.956Z", "content": "India\u2019s powerful copycat pharmaceutical industry is set to roll out generic weight-loss drugs in the UK within weeks, with one leading producer forecasting a \u201chuge price war\u201d that could widen access to the popular medicines.\n\nBengaluru-based Biocon is the first company to win UK authorisation to offer a generic version of Novo Nordisk\u2019s Saxenda weight treatment and is ready to launch sales by November.\n\nSaxenda is an older drug of the same GLP-1 drug class as the Danish company\u2019s popular Ozempic diabetes treatment and Wegovy weight-loss medication.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, Biocon chief executive Siddharth Mittal declined to comment on his pricing strategy for generic Saxenda, but predicted his company\u2019s sales of the drug would reach \u00a318mn annually in the UK after the expiry of its patent protection there next month. Mittal said he expected Biocon\u2019s generic version of Saxenda to be approved by the EU this year and in the US by 2025.\n\n\u201cWhen the generics come in there will be a huge price war,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a huge demand for these drugs at the right price.\u201d\n\nIn the US, Israeli drugmaker Teva in June launched a generic version of Victoza, a Novo Nordisk diabetes drug based on liraglutide, the same active ingredient as Saxenda.\n\nThe introduction of generic versions of Saxenda could prove a \u201cdry run for semaglutide\u201d, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, said Christopher Sharp, an intellectual property lawyer at Pinsent Masons.\n\nSharp said there was likely to be strong competition from generics companies interested in developing GLP-1s \u201cbecause the prize is so high\u201d.\n\nBiocon and other large Indian generic producers including Cipla, Dr Reddy\u2019s and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries have been eagerly awaiting the erosion of Novo Nordisk\u2019s exclusivity on GLP-1s.\n\nThe Danish company\u2019s patents for semaglutide, the active ingredient in its blockbuster weekly Ozempic and Wegovy treatments, will begin to expire across Asia, Africa and the Americas from 2026 and from 2030 in the US.\n\nWegovy and Ozempic powered Novo Nordisk to record sales in 2023. The global market in GLP-1s is expected to grow to over $140bn by 2030 from under $40bn in 2023, according to GlobalData, a data provider.\n\nExperts say entry of generic competition can typically result in a loss of around 80 per cent of the market share of the original supplier, and falls in drug prices of about 20-30 per cent.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s sales of Saxenda are down 36 per cent in the first half of 2024. The drug must be injected daily and is less effective than once-weekly treatments such as Wegovy and rival Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro.\n\nNovo Nordisk declined to comment. The Danish company is focused on increasing supply of semaglutide to meet runaway demand in the US and existing markets and to introduce it to new countries.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have enough manufacturing capacity,\u201d said Prashant Nair, director at Mumbai-based Ambit Capital. \u201c[That] is something Indian companies can provide and if that happens then India and other emerging markets can open up.\u201d\n\nIndia is expected to be a core driver of GLP-1 sales for the country\u2019s generic drug sector, the world\u2019s biggest. The World Health Organization estimates 77mn Indian adults suffer from type 2 diabetes and government health surveys show almost one in four are overweight or obese.\n\nIndia\u2019s government has also announced it will subsidise the manufacturing of diabetes and weight-loss treatments once the patent for semaglutide expires in the country in 2026.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some government push,\u201d said Joydeep Ghosh, a partner at Deloitte India. \u201cThere are several serious large-sized Indian generics players who are well positioned even now.\u201d\n\nSrikanth Mahadevan, a director at Deloitte focused on healthcare, said sales of weight-loss drugs in India were estimated to be just a tenth of those in the US, but that would change once the country introduced semaglutide treatments.\n\nIndia was going to be a \u201chuge market given how big the patient base is\u201d, Mahadevan said.", "tag": "india?page=4", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c8c72757-71d7-4d69-aa8a-9c04cf25dd0d"}, {"uuid4": "db127785-29f9-4a90-bb1e-fbcbed4ac464", "title": "Most Gen Z say Bank of Mum and Dad gifts come \u2018with strings attached\u2019", "description": "Parents often insist on cohabitation agreements in exchange for help with house buying", "author": "Jamie John", "published_date": "2025-01-25T05:00:52.286Z", "content": "More than half of young people in the UK say financial support from their parents comes \u201cwith strings attached\u201d, according to a survey commissioned by law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.\n\nFifty-six per cent of the 2,000 Gen Z adults polled said financial gifts from their parents came with conditions or restrictions, which might include seeing entrepreneurial children\u2019s business plans, or asking unmarried children who were buying properties with their partners to sign cohabitation agreements, the law firm said.\n\nThe Opinium-conducted poll found that just under half of Gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012) felt obliged to follow parental guidance when buying a house; about 40 per cent felt the same way when it came to wedding planning and starting a family.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a tension when you\u2019re trying to manage relationships in a family and there\u2019s money involved,\u201d said Sally Ashford, partner at Charles Russell Speechlys (CRS).\n\nMore than two-thirds of the young adults polled said it was likely they would rely on support from their parents for significant life expenses, such as buying property, planning a wedding or buying a car.\n\nIn the UK, first-time buyers in particular have come to rely upon parental wealth as rising prices have left all but the wealthiest struggling to buy property without support. In 2023, nearly six in 10 first-time homebuyers received family assistance in getting on to the housing ladder, according to estate agent Savills.\n\nAshford said parents often placed conditions on the gifts they made \u201cto protect assets, not to stop children being able to use them. They want to make sure that if something goes wrong in their relationships or their lives, [the assets] aren\u2019t lost for the family.\u201d\n\nProblems could arise over concerns that children might go \u201coff the rails\u201d and misuse the money or among \u201csiblings of different ages who need money at different times\u201d, she said. Ashford added that children\u2019s partners could also be a source of tension, especially when they \u201ccame into the family with less wealth\u201d.\n\nFor those whose children want to buy a property with their partner, declarations of trust \u2014 legal documents that record the terms of ownership \u2014 can prove useful, CRS said. However, in the case of divorce, the family court does not have to divide the ownership in line with the declaration of trust.\n\nAdvisers say parents should start talking about the family wealth early to avoid tensions later. Conversations could start \u201cat the dinner table\u201d, said Iain Tait, head of the private investment office at wealth manager London & Capital. \u201cDon\u2019t bottle it up, because the longer you leave it, the more difficult it becomes.\u201d\n\nOllie Saiman, co-founder of wealth manager Six Degrees, said parents could teach their offspring the value of investing while protecting their assets by putting money into children\u2019s pensions. Parents can put up to \u00a32,880 each year into a junior self-invested personal pension (Sipp) and receive a 20 per cent top-up in the form of tax relief from the government.\n\n\u201cBy gifting into a Sipp you\u2019re effectively creating an investment portfolio for the child that they can see but can\u2019t access until they turn 57,\u201d said Saiman. \u201cIt can help them start to get to grips with what happens to money when you invest it.\u201d\n\nTait said parents thinking about gifting should consider their children\u2019s feelings.

The two parties have ruled out any such move or making an electoral pact.\n\nBut an inpouring of cash into Reform\u2019s coffers would be a fillip for the party after technology billionaire Elon Musk signalled his reservations about giving a sizeable donation to it in recent weeks.\n\nReform insiders say an uptick in donations will be the latest sign of the challenger party\u2019s domestic momentum, after Farage and Candy travelled to Washington for Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration earlier this week and showcased their connections to Maga Republicans.\n\nFarage\u2019s party faces a major test in the local elections in May, however, to prove its support base is not simply a paper phenomenon. Last spring the party fielded candidates in one in seven council seats up for election, and gained a paltry two councillors in total.\n\nThis year party insiders are hopeful of making far more significant gains, including two newly-created mayoralties: Greater Lincolnshire, which they will contest with former Tory Andrea Jenkyns against a Conservative opponent, and Hull and East Yorkshire, where Labour are also in contention.\n\nCandy, who amassed a fortune in the property market and previously donated hundreds of thousands to the Tories, joined Reform as its treasurer last month, vowing to donate at least \u00a31mn of his own money to the party.

In addition to the penalties, taxpayers will also have to pay a late payment interest rate of 7.25 per cent on the tax owed.\n\nNeela Chauhan, partner at UHY Hacker Young, an accountancy group, said: \u201cHMRC sees fines as an essential part of the taxes it raises for the government and it will issue fines even if you miss their deadlines by a small margin.\u201d\n\nA freedom of information request submitted by the firm found that the number of people penalised for missing the January deadline increased by nearly 50 per cent to 600,000 in 2022-23 from 410,000 in 2021-22.\n\nMeanwhile, the value of penalties issued for late payment of self-assessment tax also jumped to \u00a3167mn in 2022-23, up from \u00a3120mn in 2021-22.\n\nHowever, she added that it was important to challenge any fines and penalties if you believe them to be incorrect, as they can be cancelled or reduced if the taxpayer can show a reasonable excuse.\n\nOf the 600,000 late penalties issued in 2022-23, 50,000 were cancelled following a challenge.\n\nThose who want to pay their tax on time but cannot afford to pay it in full by the deadline can set up a \u201cTime to Pay\u201d instalments plan with HMRC.\n\nMore people have been required to file a tax return as a result of the government cutting allowances and freezing many tax thresholds since 2022, and experts expect this trend to continue.\n\nFreezing thresholds, rather than raising them in line with inflation, increases tax receipts as rising wages and asset values tip ever greater numbers of people into the tax system or on to higher rates, a phenomenon known as \u201cfiscal drag\u201d.", "tag": "world-uk?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/43e33c48-f401-4480-8003-31c661b11cda"}, {"uuid4": "5816c945-7dbc-4b8a-9b18-395162bcc0bf", "title": "Reeves to go \u2018further and faster\u2019 for growth after recent turmoil ", "description": "UK chancellor has made more muscular use of Treasury to push changes ", "author": "Daniel Thomas", "published_date": "2025-01-24T21:00:50.597Z", "content": "A barrage of grim UK economic data this month has given chancellor Rachel Reeves \u201cpermission\u201d to pursue a more aggressive growth agenda, according to senior government officials, trampling on Labour sensitivities and putting her on a war footing with regulators.\n\nThe chancellor will next week deliver a \u201cgrowth\u201d speech against the backdrop of a stagnating economy, recent turmoil in the bond markets, and a survey on Friday showing UK businesses cutting jobs at the fastest pace since the financial crash, barring the pandemic.\n\nReeves, who wants to accelerate a number of flagship investment projects, is said by colleagues to have decided after her recent battering at the hands of the markets and political opponents to go \u201cfaster and further\u201d to pursue growth.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a view in the Treasury that all of this is fine,\u201d said one minister. \u201cIt is seen as permission for them to go harder on growth measures.\u201d\n\nAn ally of the chancellor said: \u201cShe has been frustrated by the speed at which things have been happening. She wants to use the power of the Treasury to show where we want to go next. This is politically contentious stuff.\u201d\n\nFor example Reeves, who attracted Conservative criticism for visiting Beijing this month, is pushing for fast-fashion company Shein to list in London, in spite of concerns about standards in its factories in China. She is also supporting an expansion of Heathrow airport.\n\nMarket turmoil at the start of the year led to claims that Reeves\u2019 job was on the line, but her supporters say she has used the episode to respond with \u201cstrength and decisiveness\u201d. She said this month she would be happy to be known as \u201cthe Iron Chancellor\u201d.\n\nThe Conservatives, however, say this is laughable. \u201cIt is clear Labour are out of their depth and out of ideas to get the economy growing,\u201d said Andrew Griffith, shadow business secretary. \u201cWorking people are paying the price for Labour\u2019s war on business.\u201d\n\nGriffith notes that for all Reeves\u2019 deregulatory talk, she is about to impose on companies a raft of new employment laws, which the government estimates will cost business \u00a35bn.\n\nBut Reeves \u2014 who this week was talking up the British economy at the World Economic Forum \u2014 has shown in recent days a willingness to use the power of her office to take decisive action across Whitehall, some of which is privately applauded by the Tories.\n\nMinisters this week ousted Marcus Bokkerink as chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, the monopolies regulator that has been criticised for allegedly hobbling growth.\n\nHis departure was a signal to other regulators they must push harder on growth, according to Treasury officials. \u201cSometimes a message has to be sent,\u201d said one.\n\nReeves\u2019 focus on spurring on regulators has received the private admiration of the opposition. \u201cWe should have done this ourselves,\u201d said one former Tory Treasury minister.\n\nYet while some Tories privately approve, Reeves\u2019 actions have ruffled some on her side of the aisle. She has been accused by former shadow chancellor John McDonnell of leaving the door open for critics to say Labour was \u201cdefending corporate abuse and profiteers\u201d. Another senior leftwing Labour MP said: \u201cIt\u2019s desperate.\u201d She appears, however, to be comfortable making such enemies.\n\nThe chancellor also sided with the banks this week in a Supreme Court case that will determine whether they have to pay out potentially tens of billions of pounds in redress in a motor finance mis-selling case. A new non-dom tax regime has been loosened.\n\nNext week, Reeves is also expected to signal her backing for airport expansion in the south-east, including Heathrow, in spite of fierce criticism from the green lobby and London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan.\n\nWhitehall insiders believe Reeves leaked the move to bounce her cabinet colleagues; Starmer himself has previously voted against a third runway at Heathrow, while Ed Miliband \u2014 who threatened to resign from Gordon Brown\u2019s government over the issue \u2014 this week played down any suggestion he would quit. Meanwhile judicial reviews of contentious infrastructure projects will be curtailed.\n\nGiven the threat posed to her precarious fiscal plan by sluggish growth, Reeves has told the Treasury to stop focusing on Budgets and concentrate on boosting investment instead.\n\nOfficials are working on a range of projects \u2014 some with fruit-related code names \u2014 to get investment into Britain.\n\nOne relates to a massive new Universal theme park being proposed for a site near Bedford, with officials close to talks between the company and Treasury saying that they are \u201cprogressing well\u201d.\n\nBackers of the project claim it could generate as much as \u00a350bn in economic value in its first 20 years. The Treasury has been asked to provide financial support, including for the upgrading of an M1 motorway junction and the building of a new station.\n\nOne official briefed on the talks, dubbed Project Mandarin, said they were nearly complete: \u201cIt\u2019s one of those negotiations you could conclude if you wanted to.\u201d Another person briefed on the talks added: \u201cIt\u2019s very close. It\u2019s almost there, but not there yet.\u201d\n\nOfficials said the package of support focused mainly on guaranteeing infrastructure investments and improvements, which will be critical to carrying the thousands of people travelling to visit the 500 acre site.\n\nExecutives at Comcast \u2014 whose Universal Destinations & Experiences is behind the scheme \u2014 have in the past told the FT that they wanted to build \u201cone of the greatest theme parks in the world\u201d.\n\nUniversal Destinations & Experiences said: \u201cWe continue to have productive discussions with the UK government.\u201d\n\nAlongside the theme park, Reeves is also trying to finalise negotiations with AstraZeneca to revive a stalled vaccine manufacturing site in Speke, Merseyside.\n\nThe project was paused after the Treasury sought to reduce the amount of state support provided to the British pharmaceutical company\u2019s vaccine centre, cutting a pledge made by the last Conservative administration from about \u00a390mn to \u00a340mn.\n\nMeanwhile Reeves is also expected to signal her support for a \u00a39bn highway and tunnel across the river Thames in east London, which would use private finance to defray the cost to taxpayers.\n\nThere are also signs that the government hopes to avoid any criticism that it is focusing all its firepower on the south east of England.\n\nThe Treasury has announced plans to review the \u201cgreen book\u201d it uses to evaluate the value of proposed investment decisions, long the focus of ire from critics who believe it favours London and the surrounding region.\n\nIt has also promised to build a pipeline of investable projects outside of the south east, with the help of the Office for Investment.

Mr Justice Nicklin and Senior Master Cook said that while either side could exceed the limit, they were unlikely to be able to recover expenses incurred above the cap if the other side were ordered to pay their costs.\n\nColin Campbell, a consultant at law firm Kain Knight and a former costs judge, said the ruling would likely work to the advantage of Associated, as the better-resourced party.\n\nThe case is the final leg of Prince Harry\u2019s protracted legal battle against the UK\u2019s tabloid press. The prince this week settled his claims against Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, after the company issued an apology for intruding into his private life and agreed to pay him \u201csubstantial\u201d damages.\n\nThe claimants in the case against Associated, who also include actor Sadie Frost and former Liberal Democrat MP Sir Simon Hughes, allege the company published stories about them in the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday based on information gathered unlawfully. Alleged techniques include \u201cblagging\u201d sensitive records through deception, using private investigators and intercepting voicemail messages.\n\nAssociated has firmly denied the claims, previously describing them as \u201csimply preposterous\u201d and \u201clurid\u201d.\n\nThe company had planned to spend \u00a319.8mn fighting the case while the claimants had budgeted for \u00a318.7mn, according to the costs ruling published on Friday.\n\nThe judges said they \u201chad little difficulty concluding that such sums were manifestly excessive\u201d.\n\nThey added that the claimants\u2019 respective legal teams had \u201cconsiderable expertise in this type of litigation and were not starting from scratch\u201d, citing other legal proceedings such as the case against Murdoch\u2019s company.\n\nThe claims were \u201creally rather simple\u201d, the judges added. The claimants \u201cwill either succeed or fail in demonstrating\u201d that each of the articles they have complained about was the product of unlawful information gathering.\n\nA trial has been scheduled for nine weeks, although it is not expected to begin until next January.

Disinformation began to spread online, including incorrect claims that the attacker was an illegal immigrant.\n\nViolent race riots followed and the authorities were later accused of a cover-up, particularly by those on the right of British politics.\n\nIt is a claim that police, prosecutors and the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, himself a senior lawyer and former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, have repeatedly denied.\n\n\u201cIf this trial had collapsed because I or anyone else had revealed crucial details while the police were investigating \u2014 while the case was being built, while we were awaiting a verdict \u2014 then the vile individual who committed these crimes would have walked away a free man,\u201d said Starmer on Tuesday.\n\nStarmer\u2019s position, and that of prosecutors, is based on British contempt of court laws dating back to the early 1980s, which restrict what information can be released ahead of a trial to prevent the jury being swayed.\n\nHowever barrister Jonathan Hall KC, who is currently reviewing terror legislation for the government, called the state\u2019s interpretation of contempt law in the Southport case \u201cultra cautious\u201d.\n\nPolice could, he told the Financial Times, have safely released Rudakubana\u2019s age, ethnicity, nationality, his birthplace of Cardiff and the fact he was from a Rwandan Christian background.\n\nNaming him would have been more complex, as he was 17 at the time, but Hall said prosecutors could and should have applied for a court order to do so.\n\n\u201cImagine if [police] had put out a clear, calm, authoritative, honest, transparent statement on Twitter [now X] early on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSome people are of course going to believe the worst, or in a conspiracy theory, but most people are just looking for information.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s silence may ironically have been counter-productive at trial, said Hall, because the jury could have had disinformation in their minds instead.\n\nThe justice system would now do well to \u201crefine\u201d its understanding of what \u201cprejudicial\u201d means in a social media era, he said, while decades-old contempt of court laws are reviewed.\n\nThe case has also sparked debate about the country\u2019s understanding of, and response to, acts of terror.\n\nWithin days of the Southport killings, police discovered that Rudakubana was in possession of an al-Qaeda training manual.\n\nProsecutors would later argue that this had been used to plan the attack. He had also manufactured the deadly poison ricin in his bedroom, before storing it in a plastic box under his bed.\n\nHowever while he was charged with the possession of terror-related material, he was not charged with committing an act of terror. Even police working on the inquiry said that they initially struggled to grasp why.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying: is this not now terrorism, is this not now terrorism, is this not now terrorism?\u201d recollected senior investigating officer Jason Pye, a detective chief inspector at Merseyside police, of his conversations with prosecutors as the evidence unfolded.\n\nA terror charge would also have made his investigation more straightforward, he said. Under terrorism legislation, Rudakubana could have been detained for seven days.\n\nWithout it, police had a maximum of 72 hours to put their case together and gather medical evidence relating to the 13 victims.\n\n\u201cIt would have absolutely meant we had the time to do a lot more things,\u201d said Pye of a terror charge.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the sheer range of material found on Rudakubana\u2019s 43 devices \u2014 coupled with his lack of explanation for his actions in interview \u2014 meant he could not be charged under the Terrorism Act 2000.\n\nThat defines terrorism as being \u201cfor the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause\u201d. It was later updated to include racial ideology.\n\nAmong more than 164,000 seized documents was violent material relating to the Nazis, Gaza, Grozny and Iraq, as well as footage of the attack on Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel in Australia last April.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t fighting for a cause,\u201d said prosecutor Deanna Heer on Thursday. \u201cHis only purpose was to kill.\u201d\n\nStarmer said this week that he understood \u201cwhy people wonder what the word \u2018terrorism\u2019 means\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd so, if the law needs to change to recognise this new and dangerous threat, then we will change it \u2014 and quickly,\u201d he added.\n\nNevertheless Hall, who is now reviewing the legislation for home secretary Yvette Cooper, said he is \u201csceptical\u201d of widening the terror definition.\n\nCasting the net more widely, he said, could bring in individuals such as football hooligans or organised criminals.\n\nRudakubana\u2019s case has also prompted questions over how well Britain\u2019s existing anti-extremism agencies are equipped to cope with young people fixated by violence.\n\nIn 2022, aged 15, he told Lancashire police that he had thought about poisoning people and manufacturing poison for that purpose, which he later did. The force said it would not comment further ahead of a public inquiry.\n\nRudakubana was also referred to the government\u2019s Prevent anti-extremism programme three times between 2019 and 2021.\n\nInitially he was referred aged 13, when his school noticed him researching school shootings online.\n\nSubsequently he was flagged for posting on Instagram about the former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi, while in April 2021 he was found to have been looking up the 2017 London Bridge terror attacks at school.\n\nOn each occasion, Prevent closed the case, noting that there was no coherent ideology behind his actions. He did not become a subject of interest for counterterror police.\n\nSpeaking ahead of sentencing, Vicki Evans, senior national co-ordinator for counterterrorism policing, said that at the time of his referrals the programme had not caught up with a new generation of extremists.\n\n\u201cAt the time the Prevent partnership response to the increasing fixation with extreme violence was evolving, but was less developed than it is today,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAlthough improvements to help tackle this challenge have been made,\u201d she added, \u201cit is right that questions are asked about what more needs to be done.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0279cab7-7ed6-4d04-8751-498dad6fbabd"}, {"uuid4": "2cd41735-5861-4b58-82ec-eb803d16cb22", "title": "Britain boosts electricity exports to France because of high winds ", "description": "France turns down power from nuclear fleet as it sucks in electricity imports from neighbour after Storm Eowyn", "author": "Rachel Millard", "published_date": "2025-01-24T17:28:58.310Z", "content": "Britain boosted its electricity exports to France on Friday as high winds that ripped across the country gave it excess supplies of power.\n\nFrance turned down the power it produces from its nuclear fleet by as much as 4 gigawatts \u2014 enough for millions of homes \u2014 as it imported extra electricity from Britain, according to Montel Analytics.\n\nIt highlights the changing nature of the power system as intermittent wind and solar energy are used to provide electricity to homes, businesses and factories.\n\nWinds of up to 114mph from Storm Eowyn also show Britain\u2019s growing dependence on its neighbours to buy and sell electricity to balance out an increasingly weather-dependent power system.\n\nElectricity supply and demand has to be matched second-by-second, meaning that at times of high wind, Britain and other countries might be producing more than they can use themselves.\n\nBritain has a number of cables, known as interconnectors, that link its power system to neighbouring countries including France, Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nJean-Paul Harreman, director at Montel Analytics, said France had entered the early hours of Friday morning exporting electricity to other countries due to its own low domestic demand.\n\nBut traders soon started importing from Britain as its surfeit of electricity became clear. \u201cFrance was exporting into every country it borders,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen Britain said, we don\u2019t need your power, we want to reverse the interconnector. So France was already exporting and then it got extra power from Britain.\n\n\u201cThey [France] didn\u2019t have more capacity to export, so they turned down some of the nuclear power plants.\u201d\n\nBritain now has about 30 gigawatts of wind capacity, about half of which is offshore, where wind speeds can get very high.\n\nIf output is too high from wind and other generators and extra power cannot be exported, the country\u2019s National Energy System Operator can end up having to pay wind farms to curb their output.\n\nAs Storm Eowyn hit overnight, several wind farms in Britain had to be paid to switch off, even with the exports, according to Montel Analytics.\n\nFrance\u2019s nuclear power fleet is run by state-owned energy giant EDF, which is also building the UK\u2019s first new nuclear power station in a generation, Hinkley Point C, and wants to build a second, Sizewell C.\n\nNuclear power plants, which supply the majority of France\u2019s electricity, cannot be easily turned on and off like a gas or coal-fired power plant, but output can be adjusted up to a point.\n\nAs well as adjusting its nuclear output, France used electricity overnight to pump water up to hydropower reservoirs, meaning they are ready to dispatch the water to produce electricity when needed.\n\nBritain\u2019s electricity system is becoming more complicated to manage as it becomes more dependent on intermittent supplies of electricity from wind and solar power.", "tag": "world-uk?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/caac56de-d357-46e5-b2c7-49738ff0fcad"}, {"uuid4": "a859a81a-12bb-4436-8903-82876374e38e", "title": "Andreessen Horowitz to close London office in pullback from UK crypto investing", "description": "Silicon Valley investor says it wants to refocus on US market with Donald Trump in office", "author": "Ivan Levingston", "published_date": "2025-01-24T16:43:28.482Z", "content": "Andreessen Horowitz is closing its London office and pulling back from its much-touted expansion into the UK, as the Silicon Valley investor seeks to refocus on the US cryptocurrency industry following the election of Donald Trump.\n\nThe group made a high-profile entry into the British capital in 2023, opening its first office outside the US with a focus on the UK\u2019s crypto industry amid a crackdown on digital assets by American regulators.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on Friday that the venture capital firm had signalled to local entrepreneurs and policymakers that it would scale back the time and money it intended to invest in the country.Soon after, Anthony Albanese, a managing director at the group who helps to lead its crypto investments, announced the firm would close its UK offices altogether.\u201cWe\u2019re excited by the enthusiasm for crypto building and adoption in the UK and are encouraged by the recent positive policy announcements and actions.

Others, meanwhile, have taken the opportunity to exhume dark warnings about the light touch regulation which fanned the flames of the 2008 crash.\n\nThe chancellor is right. Light touch regulation is not Britain\u2019s current problem. In fact regulation has been one of our few consistently reliable growth industries. There is no inherent tension between the economy and smart regulation which prevents monopolies, keeps markets competitive and promotes capital formation. But in far too many cases, we have something different: constantly changing rules which businesses struggle to keep up with; complexity spawning ranks of lobbyists; and inherent mission creep.\n\nRight now hundreds of sites with permission for high-rise housing are standing empty, because the new Building Safety Regulator is struggling to process them, eight years after the tragic Grenfell Tower fire. The Financial Conduct Authority, which failed to spot the Woodford scandal despite warnings from ex-City minister Paul Myners, seems obsessed with imposing diversity rules on companies, in a tenuous attempt to prevent \u201cgroupthink\u201d. Whatever you thought of the CMA\u2019s decision on Microsoft\u2019s application to take over a gaming company, the many months it spent dithering were unimpressive.\n\nThere is plenty of room for improvement. But while swapping one chairman (ex-Boston Consulting Group) for another (ex-Amazon, ex-McKinsey) may bring a different culture to the CMA, it\u2019s not a lasting solution. While some of these bodies are demonstrably failing, most are only as good as the remit they were given, by the politicians who set them up. The reason the UK has the highest electricity prices in Europe, crippling manufacturers, is that ministers have long used energy regulation to further their own environmental objectives.\n\nReeves\u2019 instinct is that \u201cthe balance has moved too far on regulating risk\u201d. This is partly because Whitehall itself is risk-averse. Officials, keen to de-risk decisions, have a tendency to push too many to Westminster\u2019s sprawling landscape of arms-length bodies.\u00a0Sponsor departments, in turn, are often reluctant to look too closely at how they are working: making a nonsense of the monitoring architecture, five-year reviews and impact assessments. But ministers are risk-averse too; and especially prone to \u201cSomething Must Be Done\u201d-ery. The classic example was in 2000, when the response to the terrible Hatfield rail crash was to introduce safety regulations which caused chaos and were so expensive that they in effect valued the life of a train passenger at over a hundred times more than one in a car.\n\nIn 2015, when I was working in Downing Street, I was surprised to discover that a Whitehall department I was dealing with didn\u2019t even have a list of the regulations it was responsible for. I asked a senior adviser what had happened to the \u201cbonfire of the quangos\u201d which George Osborne had launched five years before.\u00a0Initially annoyed by my scepticism, he eventually admitted that while some inroads had been made, the system had pushed back, and the result was less a bonfire than a tiny spark.\u00a0In 2021, the Public Accounts Committee found that spending by those bodies had since trebled; and Meg Hillier, the PAC\u2019s Labour chair, challenged the then government to explain why they were set up in the first place.\n\nBritain used to be really good at smart regulation. The creation of\u00a0regulatory sandboxes, and the speedy rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine, shows that we still can be.\u00a0But government also needs to ask itself some hard questions about what the state is for, and why we need bodies with confusing levels of overlap. Do we really need both Ofgem and the National Energy System Operator? The Environment Agency and Natural England? When Great British Railways is launched, what will be the point of the Office of Rail and Road?\n\nSir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, argues that the regulation of energy and water has become far too complex. He has proposed that they be regulated as networks, through a single regulator. That would be a much more effective approach. And unless we are able to flex our regulatory systems to better perform their objectives, how will Britain ever be nimble enough to cope with advances in AI, or synthetic drugs?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a raving libertarian to feel that Reeves is on the right track. The problem, of course, is the dissonance between what the chancellor and business secretary are saying, and what the government is actually doing. It is setting up a large number of new arms-length bodies. And it is on the verge of unleashing an unprecedented set of new employment regulations, many of which will be unworkable. Just one little clause in that package will make every pub subject to being sued by both their staff and their customers \u2014 because its demand that employers protect their employees from harassment will clash directly with customers\u2019 right to free speech.\n\nThere is still time to get this right. But politicians who want regulators to meddle less must curb their own instincts to interfere. That doesn\u2019t come easy.\n\ncamilla.cavendish@ft.com", "tag": "world-uk?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a7d8b8e4-6b0b-4198-ad70-299b0ab1a9b3"}, {"uuid4": "913911c3-b6b6-4c70-a175-29a4e479ae16", "title": "British Land and GIC sell half of Citadel\u2019s new City tower to Abu Dhabi\u2019s Modon", "description": "Deal for 2 Finsbury Avenue underlines investor confidence in top end of UK commercial property market ", "author": "Joshua Oliver", "published_date": "2025-01-24T13:34:42.515Z", "content": "British Land and Singapore\u2019s GIC have sold half of Citadel\u2019s new City of London office tower, currently under construction at Broadgate, to Abu Dhabi\u2019s Modon Holding.\n\nA deal to bring in a new investor at 2 Finsbury Avenue, which is one-third pre-let to Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel and due to complete in 2027, has been hotly anticipated as a sign of growing international investor confidence in the top end of London\u2019s office market, despite concerns about post-Covid demand.\n\nModon is an Abu Dhabi-listed real estate group backed by sovereign wealth fund ADQ and International Holding Company, which is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, one of the United Arab Emirates\u2019 most powerful men.\n\nSimon Carter, chief executive of British Land, said the deal was \u201ca vote of confidence for both Broadgate and the City\u201d.\n\nBritish Land, the FTSE 100 UK landlord, and GIC will each retain 25 per cent ownership of the tower through their Broadgate joint venture.\n\nThe willingness of an international sovereign-backed investor to bet on City office development is a positive sign for the market after a brutal two-year downturn.\n\nInvestment in London offices in the first three quarters of 2024 was the lowest since 2003, according to MSCI, with scant investor interest in large blocks. Blackstone\u2019s roughly \u00a3300mn bid to acquire the \u201cCan of Ham\u201d skyscraper was seen as a positive indicator, but the deal with seller Nuveen fell through last year.\n\nModon\u2019s chief executive Bill O\u2019Regan said: \u201cThe quality and leasing potential of 2 Finsbury Avenue together with the experience and reputation of our partners, made this a compelling entry for Modon into the London real estate market.\u201d\n\n2 Finsbury Avenue will consist of two towers of 21 and 36 storeys, linked by a 12-storey podium. It marks a major expansion of the Broadgate campus in the City of London, which is already home to UBS.\n\nFinancial terms of the sale were not disclosed on Friday. British Land valued the development at \u00a3310mn in September 2024, with \u00a3628mn of costs still to come before the project is complete.\n\nGriffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel and its sister firm, market-maker Citadel Securities, agreed to let 250,000 sq ft last spring, marking a two-thirds expansion of Citadel\u2019s London office space. The deal includes an option for the US firm to increase its lease to half of the building.\n\nThe transaction represented a record rent for the City of London at the time, British Land said. The landlord later launched a search for a new investor, saying it wanted a partner to \u201cshare [the] risk and cost\u201d of the project and free up capital for its other developments.\n\nMany developers slammed the brakes on new flagship office projects in recent years, as construction and financing costs rose, office values faltered and investors worried about the impact of homeworking on office demand.\n\nThose factors have resulted in a limited supply of top-quality buildings coming to market, allowing landlords to boost rents.\n\nCarter said he expected a \u201csignificant imbalance between demand and supply for new and substantially refurbished space, particularly in the City, leading to strong rental growth at the top end of the market\u201d.\n\nCBRE and Knight Frank advised British Land and GIC.

Some of these companies took additional, proactive steps to reduce further spread of the material,\u201d the regulator said. \u201cX Corp chose not to remove the video from its platform.\u201d\n\nThe footage of the stabbing circulated online in April but X only geoblocked the footage in Australia, meaning that people elsewhere in the world, and local users of VPNs, could continue to view the violent attack.\n\nUK home secretary Yvette Cooper said this week that the government was contacting X directly to ask it to remove the video from the platform. \u201cCompanies should not be profiting from hosting content that puts children\u2019s lives at risk,\u201d she told the House of Commons.\n\nRudakubana, 18, was sentenced to life with a minimum of 52 years in prison on Thursday after admitting to the murder of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport.\n\nMusk posted on X repeatedly in the wake of the killings, accusing UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of \u201cprioritising mosques over British girls in their dance classes\u201d. Musk also amplified posts by far-right agitator Tommy Robinson that claimed \u201cMuslims run through the streets unchallenged by police, attacking any non-Muslim\u201d. The interventions led to accusations that he was inflaming tensions that led to rioting across British towns and cities last summer.\n\nOn Friday, Musk shared an article about the Southport killings, saying \u201cnever forget\u201d.\n\nBut he has so far refused to intervene to compel his company to take down the video that Rudakubana watched, and the video was still circulating on X as of Friday afternoon.\n\nThe Financial Times contacted X to ask why it had not removed the video but received no response.\n\nThe court in the Rudakubana case heard this week that a search of a Lenovo tablet found in his house showed that he had deleted his entire browser history apart from one search on the day of the attack. Six minutes before he left to carry out the murders, he had searched X for \u201cmar mari emmanuel stabbing\u201d.\n\nWhen police carried out the same search of X during their investigation, they found it led to posts containing footage of the Sydney attack three months earlier.\n\nThe prosecution also outlined Rudakubana\u2019s online profiles and social media handles in court, including his X account. As of Friday, his X account \u2014 which is protected, so that only followers could see his posts \u2014 had not been taken down.\n\nThe Australian regulator sought to take legal action to try to force X to comply with a ruling to fully remove the video in April, a move that divided the country over whether the government was suppressing free speech or was correct to protect social media users from harmful and violent content.\n\nMusk criticised the decision, accusing the eSafety \u201ccommissar\u201d of trying to censor the internet.\n\nThat provoked a furious reaction from the country\u2019s politicians, including Anthony Albanese, the prime minister, who said it was \u201cdistressing\u201d that X was fighting the order to remove the video and criticised the billionaire\u2019s stance.\n\nHowever, a court opted against extending an injunction on the video being shown on the basis that X had taken \u201creasonable steps\u201d to stop the video being shown in Australia. The case had been seen as a potential test case for whether local regulations could be applied on a global basis.\n\nThe eSafety commissioner dropped its case in June pending a review of Australia\u2019s online safety laws.\n\nAdditional reporting by Hannah Murphy", "tag": "world-uk?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3c8923f3-9e30-4fdd-927c-d69754efd737"}, {"uuid4": "80ab6a15-46ac-4371-aaaf-a2c71963504e", "title": "UK businesses cut jobs at fastest pace since 2009 bar the pandemic, survey finds", "description": "S&P\u2019s results add to gloom about economy as employment levels fall", "author": "Valentina Romei", "published_date": "2025-01-24T12:28:33.542Z", "content": "UK businesses are cutting jobs at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, excluding the pandemic, as rising costs reignited stagflation fears in the British economy, according to a closely watched survey.\n\nThe S&P Global flash purchasing managers\u2019 survey on Friday showed the net share of businesses reducing staff numbers in January and December was the highest since the global financial crisis in 2009, outside of the onset of Covid-19 in 2020.\n\nIn the latest significant job cuts, Supermarket chain J Sainsbury this week said it was axing 3,000 roles.\n\nThe data will come as a blow to chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has spent this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos talking up the British economy; next week she will give a speech on her plans to boost growth.\n\nThe survey contained some positive news with the headline index, which tracks overall activity in the private sector, rising to a three-month high of 50.9 points in January from 50.4 in December.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected the index to fall slightly to 50 points. Any reading above the 50 mark suggests that most businesses are reporting growth in activity and companies surveyed highlighted product launches and successful marketing as driving activity.\n\nBut the S&P survey also indicated that cost burdens on business rose at the fastest pace since May 2023. Many businesses passed on higher costs to consumers resulting in the fastest increase in average prices charged since July 2023.\n\nChris Williamson, economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the survey\u2019s results \u201cadd to the gloom about the UK economy, with companies cutting employment amid falling sales and concerns about business prospects\u201d.\n\nHe warned that inflationary pressures had \u201creignited, pointing to a stagflationary environment which poses a growing policy quandary for the Bank of England\u201d.\n\nLower employment was attributed to hiring freezes and the non-replacement of voluntary leavers in the wake of rising payroll costs, according to the survey.\n\nMany businesses suggested the Labour government\u2019s decision to raise employers\u2019 national insurance contributions, which takes effect in April, had resulted in cutbacks to recruitment plans, while others cited the impact of a post-Budget slump in business confidence.\n\nThe Conservatives have claimed that Reeves\u2019 tax-raising October 30 Budget will destroy jobs and hit growth, and that a major package of labour market reforms \u2014 still being finalised by ministers \u2014 will also hit hiring.\n\nAndrew Griffith, shadow business secretary, said Reeves would be forced into a U-turn to save jobs, including possibly reversing her planned labour market reforms or the \u00a325bn increase in employers\u2019 NICs.\n\nGriffith said: \u201cTo turn this around fast something\u2019s got to give, whether it is the jobs killing Employment Bill, the NI hike or the anti-growth red tape still spewing out \u2014 or ideally all three.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury said: \u201cBy bringing back political and financial stability, we are creating the conditions for growth and this week PwC confirmed that the UK has become the second most important destination for global investment after only the US.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, a BoE survey showed that on average in November and December, 53 per cent of businesses expected lower employment in response to an increase in employers\u2019 NICs. Sixty-one per cent expected lower profit margins and 54 per cent to raise prices.\n\nA separate survey published by the research company GfK on Friday showed that consumer confidence fell by 5 points to the lowest level in more than one year in January against a backdrop of concerns over job cuts and higher borrowing costs.\n\nElliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said payroll tax increases, global uncertainty and tariff threats were \u201cdriving inflation and output in opposite directions\u201d.\n\nHe added that growth was not weak enough to warrant faster rate cuts, but inflation was strong enough to warrant caution, suggesting the Monetary Policy Committee \u201chas to plot a middle ground\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, Elias Hilmer, economist at Capital Economics, said the PMI figures \u201cwon\u2019t alleviate the BoE\u2019s concerns about the weakness of activity, but the further strengthening in price pressures suggest it will cut rates only gradually thereafter\u201d.\n\nAligned with markets, he expects the BoE to cut rates by a quarter-point to 4.5 per cent in February.\n\nThe UK economy registered no growth in the three months to September, marking a sharp slowdown from the 0.4 per cent in the previous quarter.

Three weeks into the new year and one topic dominates client meetings: pensions and inheritance tax (IHT). Some families could now be paying hundreds of thousands of pounds extra in tax on death due to coming rule changes. Many want to start planning to avoid this now.\n\nTake two of our clients, Mark and Nicola (not their real names). Their strategy had been smart \u2014 fully funding Isas while also salary sacrificing big contributions from their business into pensions, simultaneously reducing their corporation tax bill.\n\nThey were heading for a comfortable retirement, with a nice home in Yorkshire and investable assets of more than \u00a33mn. And they had the reassurance that their children would also be financially secure, because nearly all of what was left of their estate on death would be free of IHT.\n\nLast year\u2019s Budget shattered that dream. Now, if our couple die suddenly soon after April 6 2027, their sons could face an IHT bill of more than \u00a31mn.\n\nThe total tax charge on money left in a pension to loved ones might now be 64 per cent. This is because pensions face a double tax hit. First, there is the 40 per cent IHT charge. That would make a \u00a31mn pension pot worth \u00a3600,000. Next, the rules as they stand mean that if you die after the age of 75, anyone drawing money from that pension pot will pay income tax at their marginal rate. At 40 per cent, that could mean another \u00a3240,000 eventually going to HM Revenue & Customs.\n\nBut it could be worse. Because of tax tapers, the marginal rate for those earning between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3125,140 is 60 per cent \u2014 an anomaly Rachel Reeves sadly left unchanged. That would give HMRC 76 per cent on funds extracted by a beneficiary who fell within this income band.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. Adding pensions to IHT\u00a0has made some families worry\u00a0they\u2019ll topple over the tax cliff edge that arises because of the gradual withdrawal of the residence nil rate band for estates over \u00a32mn.\n\nI won\u2019t bombard you with the maths. Suffice to say that in some circumstances the marginal rate of IHT alone becomes 60 per cent. Add in income tax and, in extremes, the tax could in effect be as much as 84 per cent. You would have to be poorly advised to pay that. At least you have control over the drawing down of benefits so you could make an inherited pension the last pot you draw from, holding off until your marginal rate is lower. But it doesn\u2019t make life simple!\n\nOn top of the pensions issue is the halving of business property reliefs beyond \u00a31mn, which has riled so many farming families. On some farms \u00a31mn does not even cover the cost of machinery, leaving many wondering whether farms that go back generations can remain viable. This has rightly generated a lot of coverage, but entrepreneurs wanting to pass on businesses or who die unexpectedly while still in harness face a similar challenge.\n\nAll these changes are forcing many families to bring forward gifting strategies, triggering a \u201cbeat-the-clock\u201d game of passing on large parts of their estate seven years before they expect to die to avoid any IHT.\n\nThe new rules on pensions will not come into effect until 2027, but at a time of year when many of us are reviewing our finances, it is a good idea to start considering the implications today if IHT affects your family.\n\nFor some it will make sense to draw the tax-free lump sum from their pensions \u2014 25 per cent of any pot up to a maximum of \u00a3268,275 \u2014 and give that to the children as a one-off gift to help with house purchases. This will be subject to the seven-year gifting rules, reducing the nil-rate band available on death within seven years of the gift. Any tax liability tapers after three years.\n\nA simpler approach is to give the money gradually, drawing down more from your pensions and investments than you need and giving the excess away. Yes, you pay income tax but remember that you enjoyed a tax break on your pension contributions and couples who pool their assets smartly may be able to reduce the impact of income taxes.\n\nGifts from excess income are free of IHT but I suggest making regular monthly payments and keeping a record of all transactions in case HMRC challenges your estate on death.\n\nThe changes force people to review other assets, too. I have been asked about putting holiday homes into the children\u2019s names. It is not that simple. If the property has risen in value since bought it you could find yourself with a big capital gains tax bill. Be aware too that you may have to pay rent to continue to use it. And your children will be entitled to sell it if they need the money. You will lose control. A shared ownership structure may be more effective.\n\nWith any gifting strategy there is always the risk of giving too much too soon. Many clients worry about demotivating the next generation. Others are concerned about the money being lost through divorce. This last one can be addressed to some degree with legal contracts. I know some farming families, for instance, who are creating a family constitution. This includes as a condition of inheritance that any family member marrying \u2014 or remarrying (this applies as much to the parents as the children) \u2014\u00a0should agree a pre-nup. And if already married they should go for a post-nup. The constitution brings a degree of professionalism to an emotional subject. It is a way of saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t dislike your spouse, and it is not personal. We are just trying to ensure the viability of the family\u2019s legacy for future generations.\u201d\n\nThe other big risk with bringing forward gifting strategies is that you end up short yourself late in life when most vulnerable and needing care. Gradual giving can help mitigate this risk.\n\nWith the best care homes costing more than \u00a34,000 a week, you need to do some serious cash flow planning, considering possible scenarios. Your greatest gift to your children can be that you are still financially self-sufficient in later life. As ever, do not let an obsession with avoiding tax or ignorance of the rules lead you into financial folly.\n\nClare Munro is a tax adviser at Weatherbys Private Bank", "tag": "world-uk?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ca4ffbeb-7437-4cbf-97d4-96633615e75c"}, {"uuid4": "eff6e025-e293-49e9-8e96-6784f76eb917", "title": "Blackstone nears deal to take full control of UK railway arches ", "description": "US private equity group closes in on buyout of partner\u2019s stake in \u00a32bn portfolio", "author": "Joshua Oliver", "published_date": "2025-01-24T10:43:18.747Z", "content": "Blackstone is closing in on a deal to take full control of a \u00a32bn portfolio of more than 5,000 UK railway arches, buying out its partner five years after a deal that symbolised the advance of US private equity into the UK economy.\n\nThe US private capital group, which is the world\u2019s largest commercial property investor, has agreed to buy TT Group\u2019s half of the portfolio, which the two investors acquired from Network Rail for \u00a31.5bn in 2019, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe transaction would involve Blackstone buying out TT\u2019s stake in the Arch Company, which owns the portfolio.

I wrote a bit about that earlier this week, but now that he has been sentenced and I can write more freely I want to revisit some of it and address some of the trade-offs and some of the misconceptions about the policy challenge.\n\nThe challenge that the Southport murders pose for the British state is that it is not a mental health story or a \u201ctraditional\u201d terror story. Many of your responses to Tuesday\u2019s newsletter talked about the deleterious effects of cuts to children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and other youth services more broadly during the last government.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that these cuts have not had important negative effects for the health and happiness of people in the UK. But they were not a factor in this case: Axel Rudakubana was not, and is not, mentally ill. His defence team did not submit any evidence of mental illness and indeed their submission in mitigation was deliberately and explicitly thin. Rudakubana\u2019s defence was led by Stanley Reiz KC, one of our most respected criminal defence lawyers. He had a Rolls-Royce defence team, and you can be sure that had there been an even halfway-plausible case to be made in mitigation about Rudakubana\u2019s mental health they would have found it and made it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a case about a young man of unsound mind committing a series of horrific crimes. It\u2019s one of a young, violent man consciously planning and choosing to commit an atrocity. But nor is it one of a young, violent man doing so in service of a particular cause. Police seized 43 electronic devices from Rudakubana\u2019s house, and were able to access the contents of 32 of them. They contained more than 164,000 downloaded documents spanning a vast range of extreme violent imagery and information. But what they did not contain was any evidence of an underlying motivation beyond a desire to commit a horrific act of violence.\n\nRudakubana was known to CAMHS, had been expelled from his school, and was three times referred to Prevent, the deradicalisation programme. He had been convicted for assaulting another student. In November 2019, he was referred to Prevent by a teacher after searching for information about mass shootings on a school computer. In February 2021, he was again referred, this time after a pupil reported he had uploaded images of Muammer Gaddafi to Instagram. Two months later he was referred again by a teacher who noted that he had two tabs open about the 2017 London Bridge attack. Between October 2019 and May 2022, Lancashire police responded to five calls about his behaviour from his home address.\n\nOne reason why Rudakubana\u2019s referrals to Prevent didn\u2019t go anywhere is that on no occasion did Prevent find evidence of any underlying ideological reason for Rudakubana\u2019s behaviour other than an interest in violence. And he did not end up being detained for his own safety and that of others because he was not mentally ill. The UK, like most states, essentially has two routes to pre-emptively stop atrocities, and neither fitted Rudakubana. The challenge facing the government is: is it possible to construct a route that would?\n\nAnyone who is familiar with mass shootings will note some immediate similarities. Martin Bryant, who in 1996 killed 35 and injured 23 others in Port Arthur, in what was the deadliest massacre in Australia\u2019s history, had studied the Dunblane massacre which occurred earlier that year. Seung-Hui Cho, the perpetrator of the Virginia Tech shootings, was reportedly transfixed by the 1999 Columbine high school massacre.\n\nNow, most mass killings are not considered to be acts of terrorism, though there are occasional calls in the US to treat all school shootings as terrorism, and calls in many parts of the world to treat some or all forms of domestic violence as terrorism. (I will return to both of these at a later date as they have implications for how the British state might respond to the Southport murders.)\n\nOur understanding of why mass shooters \u2014 and more broadly, \u201cspree killers\u201d who may use other weapons \u2014 do what they do is not very good, in part because so many mass shooters either end up shooting themselves or being shot by law enforcement. Our ability to detect \u201clone wolves\u201d of any description is already limited. Frankly, the only policy lever that any nation has found that works to reduce this problem is gun control. It\u2019s the lever that Britain pulled after Dunblane, and tightened further after the Plymouth shooting in 2021. It\u2019s the lever that Australia pulled after Port Arthur, too.\n\nThe state clearly failed multiple times to spot the threat that Rudakubana posed. While it may be easy to look at the list of instances and go \u201cwell, why is the home secretary fretting about making it harder to buy kitchen knives on Amazon?\u201d*, that is misplaced. While taking steps on the purchase of knives addresses a very small part of what went wrong here, this is the lever that we know works. Yvette Cooper is absolutely right to want to make buying a knife as tough as she possibly can. We will never be able to outright stop the use of knives, so there is a limit to how far she can go, but she is absolutely right to explore it.\n\nBoth Cooper and Keir Starmer have argued that this case is a reason to change the UK\u2019s counterterror system so that it is better geared up to address and monitor \u201cviolence for the sake of violence\u201d, and the new, more incoherent \u201cpick and mix\u201d terrorism that MI5 director-general Ken McCallum warned about in his annual threat update last autumn. They have asked Jonathan Hall, the government\u2019s independent reviewer, to review whether the UK\u2019s definition of terrorism needs to be expanded.\n\nWhat we define as terrorism matters in this case because we grant greater powers to law enforcement to detain, search and monitor people if they are engaging in acts defined as terrorism than we do common murderers.\n\nThere are inevitably trade-offs here. For example, there would be reductions in freedom and liberty if we were to increase the scope of what is and isn\u2019t considered to be terrorism. It also places strain on the security services and on the UK\u2019s counterterror resources. As Hall himself said in an interview with the Times:\n\nThis is genuinely difficult. Taken together, Hall\u2019s review, Cooper\u2019s beefed-up scrutiny of the Prevent programme and the new inquiry into the failures to pick up Rudakubana will provide a useful framework to assess how and whether we should go further.\n\nAn important difference between Islamist extremist terror (roughly 75 per cent of MI5\u2019s counterterror caseload) and the extreme far right (roughly 25 per cent) is that Islamist extremists tend to aim for mass death, while the extreme far right tends to go for specific targets.\n\nThere are exceptions to that, of course, but \u201cmass death\u201d may well be the way to square this circle. Rudakubana was cultivating ricin for that very purpose. Treating violence designed to inflict mass death for its own sake as a form of terrorism might be a way to marry Starmer\u2019s desire for greater powers with Hall\u2019s justified concerns about it swamping the security services.\n\n*Full disclosure, one of the pundits to have been thoughtlessly and reflexively dismissive of that measure is me, as listeners who heard me on LBC\u2019s Cross Question will know. Several of you wrote to take me to task about it and rightly so. I\u2019m always grateful for the many thoughtful replies and emails I get from Inside Politics readers. They sharpen my thinking immensely and I am sorry I have been particularly sloppy at replying to them recently.\n\nThis article was updated to correct the date of the Columbine massacre to 1999.\n\nI\u2019m off to see the West End transfer of what was far and away the best play I saw last year \u2014 The Years, the stage adaptation of Annie Ernaux\u2019s memoir.

Baby boomers grew up accustomed to growth and prosperity, and went on to lean strongly conservative.\n\nIt was a similar story for millennials, who entered adulthood in the aftermath of the global financial crisis to be greeted by high unemployment, anaemic income growth, and ballooning house price to income ratios, going on to champion strongly progressive politics.\n\nA lot of analysis and discourse treats millennials and Gen Z as close cousins, united in their struggle to achieve the prosperity of earlier generations. But the validity of that elision depends a lot on where you look.\n\nMillennials right across the western world really were united in their economic malaise. From the US and Canada to Britain and western Europe, the cohort born in the mid to late 1980s lived its formative adult years against a backdrop of weak or stagnant wage growth and cratering rates of home-ownership.\n\nAbsolute upward mobility \u2014 the extent to which members of one generation earn more than their parents\u2019 generation at the same age \u2014 fell steadily. In the US, by the time someone born in 1985 turned 30, their average income was only a few per cent above that of their parents at the same age, a far cry from the clear, palpable generation-over-generation gains of 50 to 60 per cent made by those born in the 1950s.\n\nOn both sides of the Atlantic, the narrative of millennial malaise is no myth. They may go down as the most economically unlucky generation of the past century.\n\nBut we then hit a fork in the road. For young adults in Britain and most of western Europe, conditions have only got worse since. If you thought the sub-1 per cent annual growth in living standards endured by millennials was bad, try sub-zero. Britons born in the mid 1990s have seen living standards not merely stagnate but decline. Right across Europe, there is precious little for the youngest adults to be happy about.\n\nBut in America, Gen Z are motoring ahead. US living standards have grown at an average 2.5 per cent per year since the cohort born in the late 1990s entered adulthood, blessing this generation not only with far more upward mobility than their millennial elders, but with more rapidly improving living standards than young boomers had at the same age. And it\u2019s not just incomes: Gen Z Americans are also outpacing millennials in their climb up the housing ladder.\n\nAll the signs are that in the US, the decades-long slowdown in generation-on-generation economic progress has not only stopped but gone into reverse. Americans born in 1995 are enjoying even more upward mobility relative to their parents than those born in 1965. Zoomers by name, zoomers by socio-economic nature.\n\nBoth the change in young Americans\u2019 economic trajectories and the divergence from their European counterparts pose interesting questions.\n\nFrom a sociological perspective, in an age of borderless social media narratives and algorithms that reward negativity, can the meme of young adult adversity survive contact with America\u2019s Gen Z reality? And with a stream of negative social comparisons only a smartphone away, how will the growing realisation that young Americans are on a higher trajectory affect young Europeans?\n\nTurning to politics, will the youngest cohort of American voters tread its own path? The fact that it was not only the youngest men but also young women who swung behind Donald Trump in the US election suggests this may already be happening. A group that comes to see itself as among life\u2019s winners may not develop the same instinct for social solidarity that its downtrodden predecessors came to hold.\n\nIn an era of \u201cvibe shifts\u201d, the pivot from a sense of downward mobility to one of rising prosperity may prove the biggest yet. A divergence in the mood music on either side of the Atlantic will also surely inject fresh urgency into Europe\u2019s search for an uptick of its own.\n\nWhichever way you look at it, the restarting of the economic conveyor belt in America could prove to be a hugely significant moment.\n\njohn.burn-murdoch@ft.com, @jburnmurdoch", "tag": "world-uk?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/25867e65-68ec-4af4-b110-c1232525cf5c"}, {"uuid4": "2788fb7a-b90f-4174-9795-c18905278080", "title": "London mansion sold for \u00a3139mn to mystery buyer", "description": "The Holme is one of a few private residences located inside\u200b\u200b Regent\u2019s Park", "author": "Cynthia O'Murchu", "published_date": "2025-01-24T05:00:56.997Z", "content": "A Regent\u2019s Park mansion formerly owned by Saudi royals that fell into receivership nearly two years ago has sold for \u00a3139mn to a mystery buyer in one of London\u2019s largest ever property sales.\n\nThe Holme, which sits in a four-acre private garden within \u200b\u200bRegent\u2019s Park in central London, has been sold to a UK subsidiary of Zedra, a corporate service and wealth management firm that runs trusts on behalf of various clients, according to UK land records.\n\nThe \u00a3138.9mn sale vies with billionaire Adar Poonawalla\u2019s roughly \u00a3138mn purchase of Aberconway House in Mayfair in 2023 as the second most expensive house ever sold in London.\n\n\u201cThis is a once-a-decade kind of property\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009a mini stately home in the middle of London, in its own parkland,\u201d said Roarie Scarisbrick, a buying agent at Property Vision. \u201cThis is not a house for the shy and retiring type.\u201d\n\nUK companies have to publicly register their beneficial owners. This requirement was extended to overseas companies that own property in the UK in order to increase transparency after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut there are still gaps in the regime, which have drawn criticism from transparency advocates and some lawmakers. The individuals behind some properties can still be obscured through trusts, where information about the ultimate beneficiaries is disclosed to the government but not made public.\n\nProposing transparency measures in 2023, then-housing secretary Michael Gove said: \u201cTrusts can be used for wholly legitimate reasons. But they can, and are, created with deliberately labyrinthine structures to obscure the ownership of assets and make it easier for corrupt individuals to operate.\u201d\n\nThe company registered as the new owner of the Holme is controlled by a Luxembourg-based Zedra entity, according to corporate records.\n\nThe UK government has published new draft regulations that will allow anyone to apply for information about trusts held in the register of overseas property owners \u2014 with certain limits, for example, to protect information about minors. If approved, the regulations are expected to take effect in August.\n\nThe Holme came on the market in early 2023 seeking a price as high as \u00a3250mn after debts secured against the property expired. It was previously bought on behalf of Prince Khaled bin Sultan al-Saud of Saudi Arabia and his family in 1991 via a Guernsey-registered company called Quendon Ltd, which later listed five of Prince Khaled\u2019s children as beneficial owners.\n\nThe 207-year-old villa, which is owned on a long lease from the Crown Estate, would probably require complex and costly renovations given its heritage status, people familiar with the property said.

The fund is known for its debt strategies, and made a multimillion-pound loan to Quendon secured on the property.\n\nAttestor and Zedra declined to comment. Agents Knight Frank and Beauchamp Estates, who were appointed to sell the house, declined to comment.\n\nLondon\u2019s most expensive house sale, the 45-room mansion at 2-8a Rutland Gate, was secretly agreed just before the Covid-19 pandemic and involved a British Virgin Islands company buying the property for \u00a3210mn from a Cura\u00e7ao-registered entity.

Her passing was so unexpected that when the news first reached me, I felt sure it was a scam. Alas.\n\nAs we slowly adjust to life without her, there is some comfort that it all happened so quickly. Survived by my godfather, she has also been spared the trauma of dealing with the administrative and financial aftermath had he died first. It turns out this is something that had worried her in her later years, and finding that out has made me even sadder.\n\nWith major changes to the inheritance tax treatment of pensions on the horizon, I fear the grim complexity of sorting out a deceased person\u2019s financial affairs while you are grieving can only get worse.\n\nMy FT colleague Miranda Green used the term \u201cSadmin\u201d to describe it. We received an overwhelming response to a podcast we made last year about her protracted struggle with financial providers to settle her late father\u2019s estate.\n\nOne detail that will forever stick in my mind is a phone call she made informing her dad\u2019s private pension provider of his death, which resulted in her being quizzed about an apparent overpayment. So much for empathy! \u201cYou do feel that you\u2019re talking to a faceless bureaucracy that no longer cares because that person isn\u2019t going to take their business elsewhere,\u201d she reflected at the time.\n\nFirms urgently need to pull their socks up, but so too does the government. Grieving families have been navigating long delays in the probate system since the pandemic, and more estates are being drawn into the inheritance tax net. HMRC reported an 11 per cent year-on-year increase in IHT receipts this week, and this is set to rise substantially in 2027, when IHT will be applied to inherited pension pots.\n\nAs a consultation on the measures ended this week, financial providers branded the proposals \u201cunworkable\u201d claiming they will lead to increased costs and severe delays in money being paid to bereaved families, even in cases where no IHT is due.\n\nThe key sticking point they are urging the Treasury to rethink is who pays the IHT bill. Under the current proposals, pension schemes would be responsible for paying any IHT due directly to HMRC before any funds are distributed. Yet in order to calculate any tax liability, providers would have to work with executors to find out the value of other pensions and the person\u2019s wider estate, and how to apportion the nil rate band.\n\nAny readers who have ever tried communicating with a pension company will know that the speed of response to the most basic of queries is often glacial. So what are the chances of pension schemes correctly calculating IHT liability within six months of a person\u2019s death, after which late interest payments will be incurred?\n\nThe Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association has sensibly proposed that estates should be responsible for paying the tax, with an extended 12- month period to settle before any interest is charged, to give families and pension schemes time to work out the calculations.\n\nIt has also raised important questions about how IHT will be applied to death-in-service payments. A form of life insurance for employees, I have previously urged readers to ask HR departments if such benefits are linked to a pension scheme, and thus potentially subject to IHT in future (if yours are, ask what your firm intends to do about this before 2027).\n\nAn awful lot of misery and additional distress could be avoided if the government listens and responds to these concerns. But what about the steps we can personally take to prepare for the inevitable and make things easier for those we leave behind?\n\nIf you enjoy reading personal finance articles in the FT, chances are you are the \u201cmoney person\u201d in your household. I certainly am \u2014 so it doesn\u2019t have to be divided along gender lines \u2014 but advisers tell me it frequently is. Nor is this issue confined solely to older generations. I have a great many friends \u2014 including same sex couples \u2014 who are happy to outsource virtually all financial management to their other half.\n\nThis risks storing up big problems in the future if the \u201cmoney person\u201d dies first \u2014 and even more so if the couple were not married or in a civil partnership and thus unable to share tax allowances and defer IHT bills until the second death.\n\nIf the money person was also the biggest earner, assets such as pensions are likely to have been built up in their sole name. IHT changes will require pension providers to be informed promptly of a person\u2019s death \u2014 but what if a surviving spouse does not know about them?\n\nA decade of auto enrolment means people have pension pots from previous jobs all over the place, resulting in an estimated \u00a331bn worth of \u201clost\u201d pensions \u2014 a problem that can only compound.\n\nI did an item about this on daytime TV two weeks ago, and was bombarded with messages on social media from widowed women telling me of their struggle to find old pensions and life insurance policies they thought their husbands had taken out. Many messages were tinged with a sense of shame about their inability to navigate the system and track down this much-needed money. Heartbreaking.\n\nFree digital services such as Gretel are making this slightly easier, but the industry needs to take much better ownership of this problem.\n\nAs do we all, of course. How prepared would your partner be if the worst happened, or if you were suddenly taken ill and unable to manage the finances? It\u2019s easier if you have a financial adviser, but often, they will only have a relationship with the \u201cfinancial lead\u201d of the family.\n\nA recent study by Boring Money found that women over 65 who display at least one \u201cvulnerable\u201d characteristic were the least satisfied with financial advice \u2014 the key shortcoming being clarity and communication.\n\nAs well as sorting the basics such as your wills, lasting powers of attorney and life insurance, the digital nature of modern finances is another problem. Miranda had several Tesco bags full of old paperwork to help piece together her father\u2019s affairs. If your finances are in the cloud, how much more difficult is this process going to be?\n\nI recommend a workbook called I\u2019m Dead: Now What? that you can buy online and fill in with helpful instructions about all kinds of things (not just money) that will make things easier for those you leave behind.\n\nHaving conversations with our nearest and dearest about these things while we are still alive is awkward.

They acted after BHS\u2019s collapse sparked questions about whether audits of non-listed companies should be scrutinised in greater depth to prevent similar failures.\n\nThe designation would place the audits of roughly 600 non-listed companies with 750 employees and more than \u00a3750mn in annual turnover under a tighter regulatory system overseen by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).\n\nReynolds told the Financial Times in 2023 that, if Labour won power, it would push through the long-delayed reforms.

In London, which has a large number of flats, the proportion rises to one in three. Avoiding leasehold implies a big sacrifice in the location and type of property I can buy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a toxic system per se,\u201d says Mark Chick, senior partner at law firm Bishop & Sewell and a director of the Association of Leasehold Enfranchisement Practitioners. \u201cThe system can be navigated successfully. It is just a system where there have been historic abuses or individual examples of poor behaviour,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cAs a species, it works,\u201d says Chick. \u201cThere are plenty of people who do own flats and don\u2019t have problems.\u201d\n\nSo if you are buying leasehold, how can you better protect yourself from the exploitative and neglectful?\n\nThe first step is to be clear on what it is you\u2019re buying. When you purchase any apartment anywhere, you usually sign up to pay a share of the cost of running and maintaining the building, whatever that may be \u2014 but unlike with a house, you don\u2019t have total control over these. On top of that, comes the leasehold system.\n\nCharley Lowe, solicitor at law firm Wedlake Bell, says misunderstandings are common. \u201cI have many clients who come to me when buying a flat and when I refer to \u2018the lease\u2019 they say \u2018hang on, I\u2019m not renting it, I\u2019m buying it\u2019, so there is certainly a lack of understanding generally,\u201d she says.\n\nSome leasehold apartments have an arrangement where the residents have control of the service charge, rather than a freeholder. Other flats are sold as \u201cshare of freehold\u201d, where the building is jointly owned. Both are seen as superior, as it means the apartment owners have greater control over costs, although the responsibility can be time consuming and disagreements absolutely can occur.\n\nWhen searching for a flat, getting your hands on all the relevant information is often not as easy as you might think: many online listings don\u2019t specify the service charge or ground rent, or even how long is left on the lease (renewing can be costly, especially once it falls below 80 years). Estate agents will provide these details when asked, but ask for more and it can get tricky.\n\nDuring my own search, I asked one agent for a copy of the lease \u2014 essentially the contract that I would be signing, but was told the seller didn\u2019t want to \u201cdig it out\u201d. (You can get it from the Land Registry, by post, for a small fee.)\n\nMatt Lewis, consultant solicitor at Commonhold and Leasehold Experts, says that a problem with the conveyancing system in England and Wales \u2014 and this goes for freehold too \u2014 is that \u201cyou only get pertinent information later on, by which point you\u2019ve spent considerable sums of money on legal services and perhaps committed to other costs such as surveys\u201d.\n\nThere are some questions you can ask up front, however (see box)\n\nO\u2019Kelly says a good solicitor is important. \u201cChoose one carefully and pay them properly\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. You [should not] use a \u2018factory\u2019 conveyancing legal service when buying a flat \u2014 and certainly never employ a lawyer recommended by an estate agent or a developer.\u201d\n\nThe most well-known problem with leasehold flats is cladding, which was thrown into the limelight by the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017. The disaster led to much stricter rules on fire safety in blocks of flats, contained in the 2022 Building Safety Act.\n\nThe first thing to note is that it\u2019s not just cladding \u2014 buildings are now thoroughly assessed for fire risk and problems must be rectified. Common problem areas to look out for are inadequate fire-stopping (gaps in walls to stop fires spreading), flammable balcony materials and insufficiently fire-resistant doors, says Lewis.\n\nGetting these fixed is often expensive and figuring out who will pay for it is crucial. Lewis described the law in this area as \u201cparticularly complex and contains a fair amount of traps for the unwary\u201d, so get specialist advice if you want to buy a flat in this situation.\n\nEveryone I spoke to for this article said it was important to find out who the managing agent and freeholder are, and research them online.\n\n\u201cIf you end up looking at a property that has one of those notorious landlords, that\u2019s probably a red flag and you\u2019re going to want to walk away,\u201d says one solicitor who declined to be named.\n\nO\u2019Kelly says to look at press coverage, court reports, Companies House and the website of his own Leasehold Knowledge Partnership. \u201cThe really big landlords, all of them are abusing the system, in my view,\u201d he says.\n\nManaging agents should also be checked. There is no formal regulation of these companies, but being accredited to trade body The Property Institute is a good sign.\n\nWhat if, after you purchase, something goes wrong, or you suspect malpractice?\n\nFirst, scrutinise your annual service charge accounts \u2014 ask specific questions that signal \u201cI see what you\u2019re doing there\u201d, says Lowe. Freeholders and managing agents are legally required to account for every penny of service charge money \u2014 you can ask to see receipts.\n\nAn ombudsman is available for low-level complaints, but more serious ones require legal action. And here, the advice is to tread carefully. Legal action would probably have to be disclosed to a buyer, making it harder to move on.\n\nFreeholders can in some cases claim legal costs from leaseholders \u2014 if you sue them, you could end up paying their legal bill as well as your own \u2014 though this is due to change under the reforms. Get legal advice before withholding your service charge, as this may put you in breach of the lease and could mean you end up paying the freeholder\u2019s legal fees personally, or even have your property repossessed.\n\nIf enough of your neighbours are also aggrieved, in some cases you can apply for the \u201cright to manage\u201d, whereby leaseholders take control of block management and the service charge.\n\nBut in the end, all property ownership carries risk, as does renting. What\u2019s important is flushing out the risks, and weighing them against a property\u2019s price, location, size and everything else we consider when buying ourselves a home. As Chick puts it: \u201cNothing can ever be risk-free, but you can go into it with your eyes open.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/dbc9abcf-25bd-415d-9743-40b73b1dfbd7"}, {"uuid4": "2f100ab1-3ba3-4a1d-a4a7-a46e298fcae4", "title": "Luxury brands urge return of UK tax-free tourist shopping", "description": "Watch and jewellery companies report double-digit falls in sales to foreign visitors since measure was abolished post-Brexit", "author": "Kate Youde", "published_date": "2025-01-24T04:00:56.603Z", "content": "Watch and jewellery brands have highlighted the impact on business of the removal of tax-free shopping in the UK.\n\nRishi Sunak, then chancellor of the exchequer, scrapped the VAT Retail Export Scheme in Great Britain \u2014 which allowed visitors from outside the EU to reclaim the value added tax on goods bought \u2014 with effect from January 1 2021, following the Brexit transition period.\n\nBusiness leaders have since called for the reinstatement of tax-free shopping, with more than 300 \u2014 including watch and jewellery brand executives \u2014 signing a letter to the current chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in October.\n\n\u201cTourists are feeling completely unwelcome and disincentivised to come shopping in the UK,\u201d says signatory Sophia Hirsh, managing director of Mayfair-based jeweller Hirsh London. \u201cWe deal with a lot of clients that would come normally year on year, sometimes twice a year. They still enjoy coming to London but instead of spending 10 days here, they\u2019ll fly in, take the Eurostar to Paris, do some shopping, come back and fly home \u2014 or fly down to Milan. They\u2019re changing their habits and it\u2019s purely because of the tax-free shopping.\u201d\n\nSales to overseas tourists accounted for 4 per cent of turnover at Hirsh London between February and November 2024, compared with 30 per cent for the whole of 2019, says Hirsh, who attributes the slump to the removal of tax-free shopping. And, four years on from the change in policy, her brand is not alone in reporting a drop in trade to international visitors.\n\nFive per cent of retailer Watches of Switzerland Group\u2019s UK market came from a combination of sales to tourists in its stores and airport outlets at the end of 2024, compared with 33 per cent pre-Brexit, says chief executive Brian Duffy. He says it is UK retailers that \u201chave really lost out\u201d from the removal of tax-free shopping because they have \u201cno beneficial offset\u201d \u2014 unlike the European luxury brands on London\u2019s Bond Street that also have stores in Paris.\n\nAntoine Pin, chief executive of Tag Heuer, says it is difficult to identify the specific impact of the removal of tax-free shopping on the Swiss watchmaker\u2019s UK sales because there are other factors to consider, including the global economic environment, Brexit, and \u201cthe ups and downs of the sector\u201d post Covid. However, he says there has been a \u201cdouble-digit drop\u201d in both footfall and purchases by international tourists compared with 2019.\n\nOver the same period, Tag Heuer has seen an increase in sales to overseas visitors in Paris, Switzerland and Italy, Pin points out. \u201cAgain, you don\u2019t correlate 100 per cent, but you see the expansion of the business out of the UK,\u201d he says. \u201cWe also can trace some of our clients who used to buy in the UK, who are now buying out of the UK.\u201d\n\nPin says some tourists consult the internet on their phones in front of store staff, \u201ccalculating precisely the benefits or the drawbacks of purchasing in the UK\u201d. The \u201ctransit of purchases\u201d to other countries undermines its local investment, he adds.\n\nHirsh says a 19 per cent year-on-year decrease in sales at Hirsh London is partly due to the loss of tax-free shopping, plus a drop in new UK-based clients because they can now shop tax-free in the EU.\n\nFive per cent of tax-free spend in Europe on watches and jewellery between January and September 2024 was by UK shoppers, according to tax-free shopping specialist Global Blue. Customers from the US accounted for 27\u00a0per cent.\n\nGlobal Blue\u2019s Watches & Jewelry Study in October found the average tax-free spend per shopper on these items in Europe was up 38 per cent between January and September 2024, compared with the same period in 2019. The category\u2019s recovery is being driven by the exclusive (average spend \u20ac28,200) and luxury (average \u20ac7,750) segments.\n\nIf there is no change in UK government policy this year, Hirsh says she \u201cwill have no choice but look at other options\u201d to grow her business, including working with overseas stockists for the first time. She is also considering holding events abroad.\n\nWatches of Switzerland has focused its efforts on its domestic market. Similarly, Pin says Tag Heuer has mitigated some of its missed sales opportunities by \u201ctalking more than ever\u201d to local clients and offering experiences, from an in-store product presentation with a glass of champagne to a visit to the manufacture in Switzerland. These, he says, help build stronger relationships between staff and customers \u201cso that, eventually, the price itself is not the major factor\u201d in a purchase decision. Both companies have offered limited edition watches in the UK.\n\nBreitling launched its Superocean Heritage B20 Automatic 42mm limited edition watch in the UK and Ireland last month, having released the limited edition Superocean 44mm and Chronomat 42mm exclusively in the UK earlier in 2024. \u201cLocal special editions have contributed to creating reasons for tourists to buy, while also appealing more broadly by being tailored to the market and produced in limited numbers, adding an element of scarcity,\u201d Gavin Murphy, managing director of Breitling UK, explained in a statement.\n\nWhile the lack of tax-free shopping presents \u201csome obstacles in being competitive with the rest of Europe\u201d, he said the brand, which has 23 regional boutiques, is not entirely reliant on trade from visitors to London.\n\nLast year, the UK\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that the withdrawal of the VAT Retail Export Scheme would save the exchequer \u00a3540mn by 2025-26. However, the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy said that a fully operational scheme could have boosted UK GDP by \u00a311.1bn in 2023.\n\nInternational shoppers can still buy goods tax-free if they have them sent directly to their address outside the UK (and outside the EU if in Northern Ireland), but brands say few take up this option.\n\nHowever, UK jeweller Boodles\u2019 VAT-free export sales (excluding ecommerce) rose from \u00a32mn for the whole of 2019 to \u00a36mn for March-November 2024, according to chair Michael Wainwright, with marketing activity in the US key to the growth. Most of these sales were in store, with the jewels consigned by courier.\u00a0The 2024 figure is, however, a little skewed by a high-price sale to Oman, says Wainwright.\n\nHe says Boodles has been less affected by the removal of tax-free shopping than some brands because it sells predominantly to UK-based clients, but admits sales \u201ccould be absolutely on fire now if there was no such thing as the \u2018tourist tax\u2019\u201d.\n\nHe cannot see policy changing in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, Duffy \u2014 who, like Wainwright, signed the letter to Reeves \u2014 is \u201chopeful\u201d following last year\u2019s change of UK government. \u201cAll we\u2019re asking for, actually, is that the\u00a0government be open to objectively looking at all the facts\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. we believe when they do, they can only come to the same conclusion,\u201d he says. \u201cWe therefore think it\u2019s inevitable that [tax-free shopping] comes back. But it\u2019s a matter of when.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cWe have no plans to introduce a new tax-free shopping scheme in Great Britain.

Households built up substantial savings last year, limiting the recovery in spending, despite wage growth outpacing inflation throughout 2024.\n\nThe month-on-month drop in the GfK consumer confidence index was the largest since September 2024, when consumers were concerned about potential tax rises in October\u2019s Budget.\n\nNeil Bellamy, consumer insights director at NIQ GfK, noted particularly steep falls in confidence about the wider UK economy. \u201cThese figures underline that consumers are losing confidence in the UK\u2019s economic prospects,\u201d he said.\n\nThe survey was conducted in the first half of January, when the UK\u2019s 10-year borrowing cost rose to the highest level since the financial crisis, threatening the government\u2019s ability to meet its fiscal rule and raising the risk of more tax rises.\n\nBorrowing costs have since eased following a surprise drop in December UK inflation but remain higher than in the autumn.\n\nBusiness surveys in early January also highlighted reduced hiring forecasts, driven in part by the upcoming increase in employer national insurance contributions, set to take effect in April.\n\nConfidence was lower than the minus 18 forecast by economists polled by Reuters but was in line with expectations by Ellie Henderson, economist at the investment bank Investec.\n\nHenderson said news of rising borrowing costs and potential job losses \u201cmight well have taken a toll on perceptions and expectations for the economy and household finances\u201d.\n\nConsumers have become \u201cincreasingly worried about employment prospects\u201d, said Tomasz Wieladek, chief European economist at investment company T Rowe Price.\n\nThe GfK saving index, which is not included in the calculation of the overall confidence index, leapt 9 points to plus 30. Bellamy called this increase \u201cunwelcome\u201d as it signalled households were bracing for tough economic times by prioritising savings over spending.\n\nThe UK household saving ratio, the proportion of disposable income that is not spent, was 10.1 per cent in the three months to September, well above the 5.5 average of the 2016-2019 period, according to official statistics. Despite real wages rising for more than one and a half years, household consumption per capita remained 2.2 per cent below its Q4 2019 levels, before the pandemic.\n\nBut Henderson argued that when confidence recovers, double-digit saving rates and healthy wage growth could turn consumption around.\n\n\u201cIf confidence was to pick up, consumers in aggregate have the means to unleash a higher level of consumption,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cThat confidence recovers soon though is less certain.\u201d\n\nHousing affordability has improved, according to separate data published on Friday by Nationwide. It showed that while remaining above long-term average, the price-to-earnings ratio for first-time buyers fell to 5 at the end of last year from a peak of 5.8 in 2022.

Some bankers believe the UK could move faster than the EU in response to the emerging US regime given it is not bound by Brussels procedures.\n\n\u201cWe have to respond to the agenda the US president has just set out with our own dynamism,\u201d Jonathan Reynolds, business secretary, told the Financial Times in Davos. \u201cEvery country has to do it.\u201d\n\nThe past week has shown that the UK government is willing to be aggressive in pursuing growth, with ministers intervening to remove the chair of the under-pressure monopoly regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nA big investor in the UK described the removal of Marcus Bokkerink, which was first reported by the FT, as \u201cthe most muscular action taken by a UK government to rein in a regulator for some time\u201d.\n\nThey added: \u201cIt should hopefully put other regulators on notice that they could face similar consequences if the government\u2019s growth agenda doesn\u2019t receive serious attention and follow-through.\u201d The investor name-checked the Financial Conduct Authority as another regulator that should pay \u201cclose attention\u201d to the government\u2019s move.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Reeves repeatedly insisted that growth was the government\u2019s number-one mission.\n\nShe warned that \u201ctoo many things are holding back the supply-side of the economy\u201d, decrying \u201ccrazy\u201d rules impeding infrastructure planning and alluding to the \u00a3100mn price tag on an arch to protect bats from the High Speed 2 rail line.\n\nAreas where UK officials were eager to use the country\u2019s flexibility include AI, she said, arguing that the country\u2019s regulations were \u201cmuch more permissive, much more pro-growth than what you see in many other countries around the world, including in the European Union\u201d.\n\nYet the UK\u2019s freedom of manoeuvre will be constrained by its parallel drive to obtain a \u201creset\u201d in its relations with the EU in order to break down some of the barriers that have sprung up since Brexit. Uncertainty over how it will navigate between the two massive economies it trades with threatens to hang over the economy.\n\nAllies of Reeves were clear that they had made progress during their frenetic round of meetings in Davos. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be months and years of hard work, but we have shifted the dial in the last week and that is what businesses are telling us,\u201d said one. \u201cIt\u2019s not job done on growth but we have made a huge amount of progress. We\u2019ve never been more focused and determined.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need that fast and furious approach to delivery on the ground, and those actions need to match the ambition,\u201d said Rain Newton-Smith, the director-general of the CBI.\n\n\u201cIt does feel like the building blocks are there but it will take courage and doubling down on the things that really help to drive growth.\u201d\n\nReporting by Sam Fleming, Harriet Agnew, Ortenca Aliaj, Arash Massoudi and Stephen Morris in Davos", "tag": "world-uk?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/23d2d067-d00d-42d9-b5ef-f46586d87bf2"}, {"uuid4": "f5a955b2-626d-4be5-b48d-1f3545c93e8e", "title": "Immigration and growth", "description": "Plus stocks for 2025", "author": "Robert Armstrong", "published_date": "2025-01-27T06:31:00.238Z", "content": "Good morning. It seems that Israel\u2019s negotiated ceasefires with Gaza and Lebanon are only holding on by a thread, and may fall apart soon.

Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and aiden.reiter@ft.com.\n\nIn his first week in office, Donald Trump ordered the government to suspend the asylum process, halted refugee admissions, put pressure on states to comply with future deportation efforts, and moved to end birthright citizenship. It may be that the goal of these early actions is simply to discourage further immigration, and encourage illegal immigrants to \u201cdeport themselves.\u201d But it may be that Trump is serious about significantly reducing the US workforce.\n\nRecord numbers of migrants came into the US after the pandemic, growing US consumption and the American labour force. This, many argue, was the key reason the US continued to grow, even as inflation fell quickly. Graph from Torsten Slok at Apollo:\n\nBy the end of 2024, illegal migration had already slowed from its earlier peaks; according to US Customs and Border Protection, the number of encounters at the Southern border \u2014 a proxy for illegal migration \u2014 steadily fell from 301,000 in December 2023 to 102,000 by September 2024. Legal migration in 2024 was about 820,000, according to the Congressional Budget Office, around the 25-year average.\n\nTrump has pledged to limit both legal and illegal immigration. But does he have both the will and the means to follow through on his most aggressive goal \u2014 completely stopping illegal immigration, and deporting the illegal immigrants who are already here?\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, in 2022 there were around 11mn illegal aliens in the US, or 5 per cent of the US workforce. Pushing out even a significant fraction of that population would have big implications for the agriculture, hospitality, and construction industries (just the threat of deportations has led to reports of farmworker shortages). The inflationary implications, at least in the short term, are easy to imagine. Deprived of cheap labour, those industries and others will either have to raise wages to attract more workers, and raise prices to protect profits, or cut down on production, restricting supply.\n\nThere is a lot of uncertainty here. We don\u2019t know how far Trump will go, and it is likely that some states and municipalities will push back. Wendy Edelberg at the Brookings Institution modelled out two scenarios: one where Trump is able to reshape the immigration system entirely, and one where he only has limited success. In the first scenario, the US sees outmigration, or a net loss of civilians, starting in 2025; in the second, immigration slows, but the population still grows (the model assumes some normalisation after the Trump term):\n\nEdelberg and her colleagues estimate that both scenarios slow real economic growth in 2025: by .4 per cent in the severe scenario, and .1 per cent in the restrained. They also say that inflation could go up by as much as 1.5 per cent over three years, but will be partially offset by a reduction in demand. In the longer term, when the population growth impacts will be felt, the shifts will be more severe: the level of real GDP in 2034 will be lower by 2.1 per cent in scenario 1, and 1.5 in scenario 2, as compared to the current outlook.\n\nBut the point is all the same: the US economy is built around access to cheap migrant labour. Retooling it for low immigration will be disruptive.\n\n(Reiter and Armstrong)\n\nStockpickers \u2014 to the degree there are any stockpickers left in a world of index, factor, and quant investors \u2014 face a dilemma this year. The US economy looks strong, especially relative to the rest of the world; US stocks have momentum; and business sentiment is effervescent. A good time to add risk, then. At the same time, however, there is a massive change in economic policy underfoot, with unknown implications. In particular, it is pretty clear that something tariff-y this way comes. This will come on top of asset prices that are expensive and Fed monetary policy that seems \u2014 presidential protests aside \u2014 likely to stay tight. All this counsels a degree of defensive posturing.\n\nThose of you who \u2014 like Unhedged \u2014 will enter the FT stockpicking contest operate under even more constraints. Once you choose your five long or short positions (by midnight on the 31st of this month) you are locked in for 11 months. No changing your mind after a policy surprise. And dividends don\u2019t count, which eliminates a bunch of stocks that return their profits that way.\n\nUnhedged works under another constraint. As a US-focused column, we select from the S&P 500. We want to pick stocks our readers may know and have their own views about.\n\nUnhedged works under another handicap, too: we don\u2019t know much about individual stocks. We write about them when they demonstrate important market trends, such as Magnificent 7 leadership. Stockpicking (as Unhedged\u2019s disastrous results in the last two contests have shown) is really for people who follow companies closely. So there is a (fun but dangerous) element of guesswork here.\n\nWith all that said, below are some stocks that interest us. We\u2019re keen to hear your thoughts:\n\nReaders will notice that most of these ideas are very boring. That is the point.

The federal government currently lacks the systems, the facilities and, in some cases, the legal authority to carry out the operations that Trump has described.\n\nAccording to the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration non-profit group, it would take more than 10 years and cost almost $1tn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you just flip a switch and just immediately start rounding people up and sending them to the border,\u201d says John Torres, a former Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director during the George W Bush and Barack Obama administrations. ICE and its sister agency, Customs and Border Protection, are tasked with removing unauthorised migrants from the US \u2014 ICE from the country\u2019s interior, and CBP at the border.\n\nThe deportation infrastructure is already stretched perilously thin. In the fiscal year 2024, under Joe Biden\u2019s administration, ICE, which takes care of removals with court orders, deported 271,484 unauthorised immigrants, a 10-year high. The peak under Trump\u2019s first term was 267,000 in fiscal year 2019.\n\n\u201cThe idea of 1mn to 2mn [deportations] a year is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009aspirational. It\u2019s probably unrealistic, given the resources that are available to do it,\u201d says Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a predecessor agency to ICE, who is now at the Migration Policy Institute think-tank. \u201cThe numbers are not likely to be dramatically greater [than they are now], at least for a while.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has demonstrated a willingness to take drastic steps to realise some version of its goal, for example threatening to use an arcane wartime law that allows the federal government to detain and deport citizens of enemy nations, and opening the way for private prison companies to add capacity for tens of thousands of detainees at speed.\n\nDespite these extreme measures, however, some experts and former immigration officials told the Financial Times that Trump\u2019s ambition simply could not be accomplished.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s going to be impossible for them to achieve the goal that they set out \u2014 which is really getting rid of all the illegal immigrants in the United States,\u201d says David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute think-tank.\n\nThe first obstacle for the Trump team is to detain many of the people they say they want to deport.\n\nTrump and his immigration tsar, Tom Homan, say they are prioritising the deportation of undocumented migrants with criminal histories. Going after people who have been convicted of crimes is likely to be a more politically palatable way of ramping up deportations.\n\nICE says that, as of July last year, there were 662,566 non-citizens with criminal convictions or pending charges, approximately 15,000 of whom have already been detained by the agency. About 148,000 have been convicted or charged with assault, murder, kidnapping or sexual assault.\n\nBut one problem is that the definition of \u201ccriminal\u201d on this list is a broad one \u2014 more than 128,000 people are on it for traffic offences.\n\n\u201cWhat ICE is very good at is working off lists,\u201d says John Sandweg, acting director of ICE during the Obama administration. Agents know who they are looking for and might have location information, he says.\n\nYet Sandweg says that it takes time to find and apprehend someone who is at large after committing serious crimes, something that consumes \u201ctraditional police work\u201d like \u201cbuilding informant relationships in the immigrant communities\u201d. As a result, it can often be easier for immigration officials to deport people accused of petty crimes.\n\nThe focus on expelling undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions or charges is not new. But the Trump administration says that it is bolstering the federal response to harness the defence, state and justice departments. The Pentagon said on Wednesday that it would deploy about 1,500 active-duty troops, plus helicopters, to the US-Mexico border, a 60 per cent increase in ground forces there.\n\nHoman has also said there will be more so-called collateral arrests, in which immigrants who are not targeted for arrest are swept up during enforcement actions.\n\nLucas Guttentag, a professor at Stanford Law School, says that \u201chuge numbers of people who don\u2019t fit that profile [of criminals] are going to get swept in\u201d to any mass deportation drive. He adds: \u201cThat\u2019s going to be camouflaged, because they\u2019re trying to manipulate public reaction by saying they\u2019re only doing particular targets. The reality is going to be very different.\u201d\n\nAny push to expand arrests will also require co-operation from local law enforcement agencies.\n\nUnder the constitution, the federal government does not have authority over state enforcement bodies. Instead, it has set up so-called 287(g) agreements \u2014 voluntary programmes that allow ICE to delegate immigration enforcement to state and local agencies.\n\nIn one of the executive orders signed last Monday, Trump directed the government to pursue such agreements \u201cto the maximum extent permitted by law\u201d.\n\nThe administration seems to be building towards a political fight with so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions, which refuse to co-operate with federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump sought to deny federal funding to localities adopting \u201csanctuary\u201d policies, efforts that were blocked by US courts. The president has resurfaced this strategy, asking the attorney-general and the secretary of homeland security to \u201censure\u201d that such jurisdictions, \u201cwhich seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to federal funds\u201d.\n\nThe Department of Justice has directed staff to investigate state and local officials who fail to comply with \u201cimmigration-related commands\u201d for potential prosecutions, in what many observers view as a thinly veiled threat.\n\nOn Capitol Hill last week, both houses of Congress passed the Laken Riley Act with bipartisan votes. Named after a nursing student who was killed last year by an unauthorised immigrant, the bill broadens the number of offences that require mandatory detention of undocumented immigrants until they are deported to include theft, burglary, larceny or shoplifting. Trump is expected to sign the bill into law swiftly, which would make it the first legislative win of his second presidency.\n\nTrump has also focused on broadening the power of arrest. He has rescinded guidance set by former president Joe Biden that barred ICE agents from making arrests at or near \u201csensitive locations\u201d such as places of worship and schools \u2014 a move that legal experts warn might dent students\u2019 attendance for fear of immigration enforcement actions.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has already been successful in instilling fear in immigrant communities and making it more difficult\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009to do simple things like take their children to school, access medical care, pray in houses of worship,\u201d says Elora Mukherjee, professor at Columbia Law School.\n\nThis raises the question about the political reaction to a large increase in arrests. During Trump\u2019s first term, he faced a public relations catastrophe over the separation of migrant children from their parents. The risk for the White House is that distressing images of mass arrests make the rounds in the news and on social media, including people who are pillars of their communities, prompting a bipartisan backlash.\n\nSandweg says that when in the ICE director chair, \u201cyou get calls from Republican members of Congress [asking], \u2018Why are you deporting this guy?\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I\u2019m getting these calls from the pastor and from the congregants.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven if the administration is successful in detaining many more undocumented migrants, it would face the problem of having to house them. Tens of thousands of people will need to be held for months while they await trial in immigration courts.\n\nICE has capacity \u2014 measured in number of beds \u2014 to detain 41,500 people at any given time. Homan has indicated he will need \u201cat least 100,000 beds\u201d to carry out the administration\u2019s aims.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinarily important piece of this puzzle, and dealing with capacity issues in detention will be a challenge,\u201d says Bier at the Cato Institute.\n\nThe American Immigration Council reckons that, if the administration is to deport all the 11mn undocumented people living in the country, ICE will need to build 216 new facilities every year for more than a decade, each with a capacity of 500 people.\n\nHousing detainees will fall largely to private prisons, which accounted for as much as 90 per cent of detentions in 2023, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe market values of the country\u2019s two biggest private prison companies have surged since the election: GEO Group\u2019s stock has doubled, while CoreCivic\u2019s has risen more than 50 per cent.\n\nThe for-profit prison industry was a strong backer of Trump\u2019s campaign, after he vowed to scrap a 2021 Biden order that began phasing out DoJ contracts with for-profit prisons \u2014 which he also did on his first day in office.\n\nCoreCivic, which supplies about 10,000 beds, says it could almost quadruple this capacity in about 180 days.\n\n\u201cWe could go tomorrow and incrementally staff up,\u201d says chief executive Damon Hininger. \u201cWe\u2019re having those conversations with ICE on how we could be helpful if they do raise the level of capacity.\u201d\n\nBut expanding capacity comes at a high cost. The AIC estimates the government, if it were to deport all undocumented people, would need to spend $66bn a year just on building and operating detention facilities.\n\nNew holding facilities would cost about $36mn a piece to build and another $48mn a year to staff and operate. \u201cThe long-term costs of a mass deportation operation, while difficult to gauge, would undeniably be enormous,\u201d the AIC concluded in a recent report.\n\nRepublicans have promised to allocate up to $100bn for border security and enforcement for an unspecified timeframe. But even if they can get that through Congress, in the near term the authorities will struggle to muster the necessary resources \u2014 even if other law enforcement agencies are roped in.\n\n\u201cThere is no way\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they have the staff, the money and the resources and the legal authority to turn and start doing immigration enforcement [and] immigration detention,\u201d says Jason Houser, a former ICE chief of staff.\n\nThe final logistical challenge for the administration is deporting the people who have been detained.\n\nIndividuals with outstanding deportation orders may be removed immediately. \u201cBut that is a relatively small number,\u201d says Stephen Yale-Loehr, retired immigration law professor at Cornell Law School. \u201cMost people picked up will be put into deportation proceedings in immigration courts.\u201d\n\nThat places the rest of the burden on underfunded and overburdened immigration courts, which could be a significant stumbling block to Trump\u2019s plans. The courts\u2019 backlog has swelled from 656,000 pending cases in the fiscal year 2017 to 3.6mn at the end of fiscal year 2024, according to MPI.\n\nTrump is seeking to sidestep immigration courts altogether. The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday issued a new rule that expanded the reach of \u201cexpedited removal\u201d, under which undocumented immigrants who cannot prove they have been in the country for more than two years are deported with no court review. Trump pursued a similar measure during his first presidency.\n\nThe practice previously applied to individuals apprehended within around 115 miles of the country\u2019s international land borders. Now, it may be used across the US.\n\n\u201cThe effect of this change will be to enhance national security and public safety \u2014 while reducing government costs \u2014 by facilitating prompt immigration determinations,\u201d said the DHS.\n\nThe Trump administration could also face opposition\u00a0from some of the countries to which it wants to deport migrants. Colombia announced on Sunday that it had declined entry to US military flights carrying migrants, saying the individuals needed to be flown on civilian planes and treated with \u201cdignity and respect\u201d.\n\nTrump immediately responded by placing 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Colombia, which were later paused after Bogot\u00e1 agreed to grant entry to the military flights.\n\nTrump\u2019s flurry of immigration policies is set to face a wave of legal challenges, with some Democratic states and civil rights groups already suing his administration.\n\nThe ACLU and other groups on Wednesday sued to block the DHS rule broadening \u201cexpedited removal\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration wants to use this illegal policy to fuel its mass deportation agenda and rip communities apart,\u201d Anand Balakrishnan, an ACLU lawyer leading the case, said in a statement. \u201cExpanding expedited removal would give Trump a cheat code to circumvent due process and the constitution.\u201d The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDemocratic state attorneys-general and civil rights groups have also filed several lawsuits to invalidate Trump\u2019s new executive order that bans birthright citizenship, alleging that it violates the constitution\u2019s 14th amendment, which says that all \u201cpersons born or naturalized in the United States\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009are citizens of the United States\u201d. This ban has already been temporarily halted by a US federal judge. The White House said it would appeal.\n\nHoman on Sunday said that his idea of success does not necessarily include deporting every unauthorised immigrant in the US, in what seemed like an attempt at managing expectations. \u201cI\u2019m being realistic,\u201d he told ABC. \u201cWe can do what we can with the money we have\u201d.\n\nBut Homan has also insisted the administration will accelerate arrests and detentions, even if there is political opposition. And he is willing to put heavy pressure on local politicians who try to stymie those efforts.\n\n\u201cSanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don\u2019t want \u2014 more agents in the communities, more people arrested, more collaterals arrested,\u201d he told Fox News on Wednesday. \u201cSo that\u2019s a game they want to play? Game on.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Alex Rogers in Washington\n\nCartography by Cleve Jones\n\n\u200bLetter in response to this article:\n\nIn Trump era, politics is a game two can play\u00a0/\u00a0From Donald Conkey, Chicago, IL, US", "tag": "us?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/59232a13-f7e2-40cd-af73-4035037cb3b3"}, {"uuid4": "e11c8d7f-e364-4ba8-b554-2ad7e73bc10f", "title": "Why the billable hour is still king in the legal world", "description": "High bonus payments to lawyers hitting targets show the model\u2019s staying power in face of AI  ", "author": "Suzi Ring", "published_date": "2025-01-27T05:01:00.851Z", "content": "As Christmas approached, lawyers at US firms across the City of London and Wall Street rushed to hit tough end-of-year targets for the number of hours billed to clients in 2024.\n\nOne mid-level litigation associate at a US law firm in London said he had billed more than 2,000 hours, spending at least 10 hours in the office every day and working some weekends, as he helped a client prepare for a big trial. This year looks set to be just as busy.\n\nMany have predicted the demise of the billable hour as the legal profession\u2019s main charging method. But the recent bumper payday for junior lawyers \u2014 many top US firms have handed out six-figure bonuses to associates for hitting 2,000-plus billable hour targets \u2014 is the latest sign of the staying power of the industry\u2019s hallmark currency.\n\nFor years the metric, through which lawyers keep a precise log of the work they do and bill accordingly, has been a source of debate and tension between law firms and their clients. Companies have pushed back at perceived overcharging, with some arguing for the greater certainty of a fixed-fee model. Lawyers and clients have raised concerns over the well being of the armies of junior associates competing to hit high billing targets. Now, the advancement of generative artificial intelligence is fuelling fresh criticism that billing by the hour is an outdated model that encourages inefficiency.\n\n\u201cWhile some might have expected, and some predicted [the billable hour\u2019s] use as an external measure would have fallen faster, it remains the main billing method used by law firms,\u201d says Jeremy Black, a partner at Deloitte.\n\nIn the UK, the top 10 law firms are charging clients almost 40 per cent more per hour than they were five years ago and notched up more billable hours last year than the 12 months before, according to PwC.\n\nHourly rates for partners at top UK-headquartered firms have reached \u00a31,500, with US firms\u2019 rates as high as $2,000.\u00a0Rates in the top American firms last year were up more than 8 per cent, according to the Thomson Reuters Institute.\n\nSuch growth means there is little incentive for law firms to move away from the metric towards more flat-fee or subscription-type models that industries from media to consumer goods have adopted.\n\nThe billable hour took off as a linchpin for the legal industry in the 1980s, according to academic and legal publications on its history. With the rise of trade magazines such as The American Lawyer and a greater emphasis on the business of law, such metrics, along with partner profits, became important benchmarks by which firms could measure their success.\n\nThe metric survives in part because of its \u201cgreat symbolic value\u201d, says Laura Empson, a professor at Bayes Business School. \u201cIt\u2019s sending a signal to the client that professionals are dedicated to serving them.\u201d\n\nBut the new threats \u2014 chiefly AI \u2014 are set to increasingly call into question the viability of the model. In recent years, experts have anticipated a profound impact from generative AI on law firms, particularly on junior jobs. As more mundane legal tasks become automated, there would be fewer working hours for lawyers to bill.\n\nSo far, efficiencies gained by AI assisting routine tasks, such as research and drafting documents, appear to have made little headway in displacing the billable metric.\u00a0But lawyers surveyed by Thomson Reuters last year predicted AI would result in a reduction in the use of the billable hour over the next five years, saving each 12 hours of work a week.\n\nA study by Deloitte last year found that \u201conly 6 per cent of respondents report direct benefits, such as cost savings, from law firm use of the technology\u201d \u2014 but 73 per cent anticipated AI would reduce costs in law firms in the future.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more experimentation of fixed-price models, and the increasing adoption of technology will lead to change of the billing model; we\u2019re simply not there yet,\u201d says Raghu Ramanathan, president of Legal Professionals at Thomson Reuters.\n\nFiona Muir, product manager at OneAdvanced, a software provider to law firms, anticipates technology will enhance the billable hour, increasing the speed and detail of billing, for example by automatically documenting a phone call. \u201cThe narrative that you create around the task [is] easier to do. The billing is less contentious if there\u2019s more detail.\u201d\n\nThe legal sector\u2019s commitment to billable hours appears stronger than for other professional services firms. \u201cGo back 20-30 years, [consultants] were like lawyers,\u201d says Fiona Czerniawska, chief executive of Source Global Research, a consulting sector analyst, which moved away from charging by the hour after client pressure.\n\n\u201cA lot of the buyers of [legal services are] in-house lawyers,\u201d says Ben Kent, founder of Meridian West, a consultancy. \u201cThey make a noise about it but put up with it. Part of the same club.\u201d\n\nOne reason for its endurance is the inexact science of legal advice. While parts of a deal may be predictable and amenable to a fixed fee, areas such as big-ticket litigation can be harder to forecast and lawyers do not want to find themselves spending extra hours on a matter they are not getting paid for. Lawyers say clients largely accept its value even if they would like more flexibility and scrutiny of what is being billed.\n\nAmong the informal guidance given to young lawyers on billing clients is to keep the timer running if you pop to the kitchen to make a cup of tea but not if you stop to chat with a colleague. Mulling a client issue in the bath or on the train may also be billable, as long as you can properly justify it.\u00a0Software enables lawyers to track their time, usually in six- or 15-minute increments.\n\nTerra Potter, general counsel at aerospace company Hexcel Corporation until last year, describes the model as a \u201ccomplex beast \u2014 it\u2019s hard to abandon entirely\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It shows the return on investment, helps monitor work and budgets\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Some matters suit the billable hour, particularly smaller ones or those with high uncertainty. Others \u2014 litigation tranches, transactions, or document packages \u2014 lend themselves better to flat fees.\u201d\n\nBeyond its use for charging clients, the billable hour has become a key internal metric for law firms to measure and reward performance.\n\nDespite greater discussion of staff wellbeing, junior lawyers are expected to put in long hours to justify their increasingly high salaries. In the UK\u2019s top firms, newly qualified lawyers\u2019 base pay rose to \u00a3150,000 last year. At many US firms, it is even higher, reaching almost \u00a3180,000.\n\nHitting 2,000 hours a year equates to eight billable hours a day across the working week \u2014 but this does not include the many non-billable hours worked or holidays.\u00a0Some US firms pay associates extra bonuses for racking up billable hours beyond the 2,000 target. Many top UK firms deny having targets but will often only pay bonuses if certain hours are met, usually closer to 1,700 a year.\n\nBut as a measure of performance, the metric is flawed. Fulfilling targets is, in many ways, outside of a junior lawyer\u2019s control. Associates compete for work from partners to fill their quota and for every quiet week or month there is an awareness they will have to work twice as hard when business picks up. This can lead to \u201chuge peaks and troughs\u201d in working hours, according to one litigation associate at a UK firm.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s not enough work coming in or teams are over-resourced then it creates a degree of anxiety because if you have a quiet month then you know you\u2019re going to need to have some crazy months to make up for it,\u201d the associate says.\n\nThis feast or famine approach has led to some lawyers leaving private practice. One former associate at a UK firm says they moved to an in-house role in part because of the billable hour and its use as \u201can outdated method of measuring value to a law firm\u201d. The impact the high targets could have on family life was another factor.\n\nIt incentivises inefficiency, says Richard Martin, a former employment partner and now principal consultant of Byrne Dean, a wellbeing consultancy. \u201cWhen people are tired and stressed, they work less effectively and take longer. It\u2019s a vicious circle.\u201d It also encourages \u201choarding work\u201d.\n\nRewards are given to those with the physical stamina to endure such working habits, according to Empson at Bayes.\n\n\u201cPeople who are capable of billing enormous amounts of hours become heroes in firms,\u201d she says. \u201cFor all that is said about the intellect of professionals, big rewards go to people with phenomenal reserves of stamina and good health.\u201d\n\nEven if firms shift to a different fee model for clients, the billable hour will probably survive internally, according to Deloitte\u2019s Black, as it is the simplest way of measuring output. \u201cIt is likely that it will be combined with other data to provide information on the value created related to the time spent,\u201d Black suggests. \u201cOver time it does seem the internal use may be of more relative importance.\u201d", "tag": "us?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7750aff2-0677-4ba9-b571-4e02cf83950d"}, {"uuid4": "f36e8c74-0a9d-4dfd-9d61-55adbffcf199", "title": "Emerging markets braced for Trump tariffs threat", "description": "US president\u2019s policies are likely to push up dollar-denominated debt, hurting economies such as Mexico and Malaysia", "author": "Chris Newlands", "published_date": "2025-01-27T05:01:00.793Z", "content": "The outcome of the US election was supposed to be drawn out, hard to call, and heavily contested.\n\nIn the end, it was none of the above. Donald Trump\u2019s victory at the beginning of November turned out to be emphatic, quickly decided, and accepted with little or no fuss. But that does not mean there were no immediate consequences.\n\nWithin moments of Trump beating Democrat vice-president Kamala Harris to retake the White House, the dollar had soared to a four-month high. Although the US currency recently dropped as the new president called for lower interest rates and a softer stance on China tariffs, its strength could wreak havoc for emerging market bonds.\n\nThe consensus is that Trump\u2019s policies around curbing illegal immigration, enforcing trade tariffs and lowering taxes will trigger price rises \u2014 and ultimately hinder the US central bank\u2019s ability to lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cDollar-denominated debt will rise as a result, which will seriously impact many emerging markets,\u201d says David Gibson-Moore, president of consultancy Gulf Analytica.\n\nJean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging market debt at investment company TT International, agrees. \u201cTrump\u2019s decisive victory has led to much doom-mongering among economists and emerging market investors alike,\u201d he says. \u201cThe consensus seems to have settled around a simple narrative that tariff threats will lead to higher inflation, less monetary easing and a stronger dollar,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cAmid a salvo of \u2018America first\u2019 rhetoric, EM equities have underperformed their US counterparts since the election, while outflows from EM bond funds have accelerated, taking total net withdrawals for 2024 to over $20bn,\u201d Sambor points out.\n\nTrade tariffs are clearly \u201cvery bad news\u201d for emerging market debt, says Mike Riddell, portfolio manager at Fidelity International. But the key question for EM investors, he says, \u201cis just how much of Trump\u2019s tariff narrative is bark, and just how much is bite\u201d.\n\nIf Trump does bite, then some emerging market economies will be hit harder than others. According to proprietary data from asset manager Ninety One, the likes of Malaysia, Czech Republic, Hungary, China and Mexico would be hardest hit, while Argentina, Israel, Kenya, Egypt and Uganda would suffer the least.\n\nMarket commentators suggest bond investors will need to focus on resilient markets with low external debt and strong domestic consumption.\n\n\u201cThe form and timing of US tariffs is obviously very hard to predict and, ultimately, it is the detail that will matter,\u201d says Grant Webster, co-head of emerging market sovereign debt at Ninety One. \u201cBut the economies most exposed are those in which trade forms a large part of their GDPs, and those that run large surpluses to the US.\u201d\n\nHe predicts those likely to gain \u2014 or, at least, to lose out less \u2014 are the Latin American economies aside from Mexico, which are more closed off and have less exposure to Europe and China via their supply chains.\n\n\u201cThink of Argentina, for example, which has a low level of exports to the US and a relatively closed economy,\u201d Webster says. \u201cAnother notable winner is India. India, given its enormous domestic economy, has low exports to the US relative to GDP, is relatively closed, runs a high services balance, and is not deeply integrated into global supply chains.\u201d\n\nGibson-Moore concurs. \u201cIndia will emerge as a safe haven,\u201d he predicts. \u201cDespite the very real risks of a Trump administration, there are opportunities. Emerging markets with strong domestic fundamentals are better positioned to weather the storm.\u201d\n\nIndeed, many commentators believe the naysayers are being overly pessimistic given that investors have more information on what to expect from Trump this time around compared with 2016.\n\nAnd, even then, there were several positives from the first Trump administration for emerging markets, recalls Carlos Carranza, portfolio manager at asset manager Allianz Global Investors.\n\n\u201cFirst, despite the volatility seen in EM assets over the first Trump administration, the returns for EM bonds were solid,\u201d he says. \u201cDollar-denominated sovereign bonds delivered close to 25 per cent over the 2016 to 2019 period and, in fact, outperformed US high yield and US investment grade bonds.\u201d\n\nToday, he believes the macroeconomic outlook remains constructive for emerging markets, with GDP growth in the US showing resiliency and the US Federal Reserve still committed to lowering interest rates.\n\nMark Mobius, chair of Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund, agrees. \u201cWe expect there will be a revival of the US economy, which will be good for almost all nations, including emerging markets.\u201d\n\nAlan Siow, Ninety One\u2019s co-head of emerging market corporate debt, adds that investors will be able to take comfort from the familiar and the fact \u201cwe have seen this movie before\u201d.\n\n\u201cDuring the previous Trump administration, various tariffs and trade policy tools were threatened against China, for example,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, in respect of China, despite a material increase in effective tariff rates, the economic impact was muted.\u201d", "tag": "us?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/463e0810-f118-45a2-9a91-1110bd44ed67"}, {"uuid4": "0c488bcd-794d-4f2d-b1d5-01e511705178", "title": "The blue states vs Donald Trump", "description": "Looming legal battles with the new administration will make lawyers rich and business more complicated ", "author": "Rana Foroohar", "published_date": "2025-01-27T05:01:00.775Z", "content": "The idea of \u201ctwo Americas,\u201d one rich and one poor, one blue and the other red, has been around for decades. But now, thanks to Donald Trump, there are about to be fifty Americas.\n\nAs fast as the new president can sign executive orders, individual state governments are stepping up to challenge them in court. The upshot will be a more confusing environment for business \u2014 and a richer one for lawyers \u2014 as blue states look for ways to shield themselves from immigration raids, weaker environmental regulations, Big Tech monopoly power and massive cuts in federal aid for everything from healthcare to emergency relief.\n\nThe lawsuits, which were rife during Trump\u2019s first term, began again last week as Massachusetts, New Jersey and California led a group of 18 states in filing a challenge to the president\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship. Four other states filed a similar suit. As Massachusetts attorney-general Andrea Joy Campbell put it, \u201cbirthright citizenship\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009is a guarantee of equality, born out of a collective fight against oppression\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It is a settled right in our Constitution and recognised by the Supreme Court for more than a century.\u201d\n\nWhile one can only hope that today\u2019s conservative court won\u2019t approve a modern-day version of the 1857 Dred Scott decision that prohibited citizenship for enslaved people, the battle will be expensive and protracted. Ironically, a series of rulings made by the Supreme Court at the end of 2023 actually make it much easier for individuals, businesses and aggrieved states to take on the federal government.\n\nBlue state governments are, for example, taking charge of many of the monopoly fights waged by the Biden administration. Minnesota\u2019s progressive attorney-general Keith Ellison has replaced former Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan as the face of the war on predatory ticket prices, algorithmic manipulation of real estate markets, grocery monopolies and rent-seeking pharmaceutical companies.\n\nStates will also be ground zero for the rollback of climate legislation, including Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which Trump insists on calling the Green New Deal. While the president may seek to rebrand some of the provisions that benefited red states as his own, he\u2019s dumping subsidies for things like electric vehicles.\n\nCalifornia is preparing for the coming climate battle. Between 2017 and 2021, the state sued the Trump administration 123 times, racking up several wins against environmental deregulation, albeit mostly on administrative grounds. This time around, the Trump administration has experience and better bureaucratic chops. California has already withdrawn several requests that it had been granted under the Biden administration to enforce its own higher pollution restrictions. And Trump is threatening to withhold federal disaster relief for LA unless the state changes its water management, blaming conservation efforts for the city\u2019s inability to get fires under control.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has requested $25mn from the state budget to cover expected litigation costs from battling Trump. The state will also use the power of its own enormous economy (the fifth largest in the world) to try and cut deals with big companies that meet its own clean energy standards, as it did with major global automakers during the first Trump tenure.\n\nThis is an important point. The blue states are home to most of the country\u2019s biggest and richest consumers. They can create strong demand signals for the rest of the country, even if the president doesn\u2019t like it. When the New York City Housing Authority, for example, decides to adopt a certain kind of window, it can set industry standards for years. When California or New York or Illinois or Massachusetts select a certain kind of technology platform for public education systems, or a particular food safety rule, or a certain approach to labour and AI, it can tip the balance of what companies do.\n\nOf course, the economic pull of doing business in such places will also be balanced against the regulatory burdens they impose, particularly relative to red states that will be happy to adopt Trump\u2019s deregulatory, laissez-faire agenda. A friend of mine with a small business recently spent a year and tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees trying to safely fire a lazy and potentially litigious person she\u2019d hired in California who worked remotely. Her replacement is from business-friendly Tennessee.\n\nHistorically, US states tend to band together best when fighting against something, and this time is no different. Last November, Illinois governor JB Pritzker and Colorado governor Jared Polis created a new group called Governors Safeguarding Democracy, with the aim of pooling resources to combat the Trump agenda. Pritzker, for example, has said he won\u2019t co-operate if Trump tries to use red state National Guard units for deportations in blue states. Would California send resources to help?\n\nHere\u2019s hoping such questions remain the stuff of dystopian films. The reality is that blue states, many of which have big deficits, will have to find ways to cope with less fiscal support from Washington. Conservatives are already calling for a new kind of fiscal federalism, blaming overgrown state budgets for the national debt problem. No prizes for guessing where the first cuts will be made.\n\nrana.foroohar@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/11ce0088-7863-4113-b90f-61d438d026bd"}, {"uuid4": "bddae326-c2dc-4628-a462-692c98b3f050", "title": "Fixed income investors seek ways to navigate a Trump presidency", "description": "US Treasuries, traditionally a haven asset, have become a riskier, more volatile bet", "author": "Laurence Fletcher", "published_date": "2025-01-27T05:01:00.637Z", "content": "The sharp sell-off in US bonds may not yet be over, say fund managers and analysts, as they try to work out the longer-term impact of President Donald Trump and his policies on Treasury yields and prices.\n\nInvestors have already seen the yield on the 10-year Treasury rise from as little as 3.6 per cent in mid-September to about 4.8 per cent this month \u2014 its highest level since November 2023 \u2014 before falling back, slightly, to about 4.64 per cent. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\n\nThese moves have been driven, in part, by the so-called \u201cTrump trade\u201d, as investors started to price in an election victory for the Republican candidate and resulting policies that could add further fuel to an inflation rate already above target.\n\nWith yields of 5 per cent being talked about as a possibility by some commentators \u2014 and little clarity on how Trump will pursue his plans for trade tariffs, tax cuts and deportations of illegal immigrants \u2014 many see little reason to call an end to the rises just yet.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to get in the way of the rise in US Treasury yields right now as it could be based upon markets testing a shift to a new regime, as Trump [tariff] threats are taken more seriously,\u201d explained TS Lombard chief economist Freya Beamish, in a recent note.\n\nStrong jobs market data and above-target inflation have added to jitters among investors. US consumer price inflation was 2.4 per cent in September but ticked up to 2.9 per cent in December, although core inflation for that month unexpectedly fell. On the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred Personal Consumption Expenditure measure, inflation was 2.4 per cent in November \u2014 still above the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target.\n\nThese metrics means that, for many fund managers, Treasuries \u2014 traditionally seen as a haven asset \u2014 are a riskier, more volatile bet than in the past.\n\n\u201cInvestors are demanding more compensation to hold an asset class that has more uncertainty,\u201d says Matthew Morgan, head of fixed income at Jupiter Asset Management. \u201cInflation is not going away as quickly \u2014 that\u2019s the primary problem. The starter of this move was as much [the inflation] data as Trump.\u201d\n\nMany investors remain concerned about the federal budget deficit, which grew under former president Joe Biden to $1.8tn in the year to September \u2014 or more than 6 per cent of US GDP. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office forecast it would hit $2.6tn by 2034.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s plan to cut the deficit to 3 per cent, and his appointment of Elon Musk to head a project to slash the size of the state, many commentators expect the deficit to grow under the new president. This has raised concerns about the amount of bond issuance required.\n\n\u201cThe US [deficit] is wide,\u201d says Mitch Reznick, group head of fixed income in London at Federated Hermes. \u201cIt can generally operate wider than other jurisdictions, but there are limits to that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still a little bit wary of the long end in bonds, [until] we see catalysts of growth and deficits under control,\u201d he adds.\n\nGreg Venizelos, fixed-income strategist at St James\u2019s Place, cites \u201cthe uncertainty we\u2019ve seen surrounding Trump 2.0\u201d as a factor behind the surge in yields, and says the firm\u2019s house view is to be neutral on government bonds.\n\nHowever, some investors have been using the sell-off as an opportunity to buy. Jupiter\u2019s Morgan says that the firm\u2019s fund managers have, on balance, been increasing their positions in longer-term bonds more sensitive to moves in interest rates.\n\n\u201cGovernment bonds look attractively priced right now,\u201d he suggests. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to make money on a 12- to 24-month view, but you\u2019re going to take some volatility.\u201d\n\nFund managers have also been trying to take advantage of the upheaval in the Treasury market by betting on the steepening of the yield curve, as yields on longer maturity debt have risen relative to those on shorter-term bonds. Traders can profit by betting on shorter-term debt prices rising while betting against longer-term bonds.\n\nThe so-called term premium \u2014 the extra return for investors for taking on interest rate risk over longer periods \u2014 has risen to its highest level since 2014, according to data from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe recent move in 10-year bonds globally, which steepened yield curves around the world, has been \u201cspectacular\u201d, wrote Natixis, in a note to clients.\n\nFederated Hermes\u2019 Reznick and fund managers under Jupiter\u2019s Morgan are among those to have run \u2018steepener\u2019 trades. Michael Krautzberger at Allianz Global Investors has also had such trades on, and has taken some profits.\n\nBut, while Treasury moves have been dramatic, some commentators believe certain threats to the market posed by Trump could prove to be overblown. For example, plans to introduce widespread tariffs may be scaled back, as indicated by some of the president\u2019s comments since his inauguration.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we see scope for a [trade] deal to be done avoiding materialisation of these threat[s]\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. providing opportunities for a reprieve,\u201d said TS Lombard\u2019s Beamish last week.", "tag": "us?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0e1df0c7-c431-42e6-8e02-79dfaeb31c56"}, {"uuid4": "1eca1fec-ab16-4075-abe9-11c15d5ff61f", "title": "US pauses tariffs on Colombia after deal on deportations", "description": "Bogot\u00e1 had turned back American planes carrying deported migrants", "author": "Stefania Palma", "published_date": "2025-01-27T04:25:17.385Z", "content": "The Trump administration said it was pausing punitive tariffs against Colombia after its leader agreed to grant entry to US military flights deporting migrants.\n\nThe announcement appeared to head off a trade war between the two allies after Colombia denied entry to two US military aircraft carrying deportees on Sunday.

Three of Perino\u2019s Fox News colleagues are in line for positions in Donald Trump\u2019s new cabinet: Pete Hegseth, a former host at the channel, was confirmed as defence secretary at the weekend; Tulsi Gabbard, a Fox contributor and former Democratic congresswoman turned Republican, has been put forward as director of national intelligence; while Sean Duffy, a host on Fox Business, has received the nod for transportation secretary.\n\nFox News has had a rocky few years, settling a $787.5mn defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems in 2023, over on-air claims the company helped rig the 2020 election for Joe Biden (an additional $2.7bn defamation suit from another voting system group, Smartmatic, is pending). Yet the network beloved by conservatives remains the most watched cable news channel in the US, routinely trouncing rivals CNN and MSNBC in the ratings. Many of its presenters share a worldview with Trump: Tucker Carlson, a former Perino colleague and bogeyman of liberals everywhere, does not have an official role but is known to have regular conversations with the new US president. National Public Radio recently calculated that for his second term, Trump has given jobs to at least 19 past and present hosts, journalists and commentators from the network, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox Corp.\n\nPerino would be a natural choice to join them, given her experience as White House press secretary under George W Bush. In that role, which she held for two years, she sustained an injury to her eye in the melee that followed an Iraqi journalist throwing a shoe at the then president.\n\nBut the 52-year-old says there is only one position that would persuade her to return to government. \u201cThe only job I would want\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009would be ambassador to Tanzania,\u201d she says, slightly unexpectedly. Africa holds a special place in her heart, she explains: she worked with Bush on the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) and, together with her husband, has spent time volunteering on its west coast since she left the White House in 2009.\n\nHer internationalist view and belief in the importance of overseas aid is a far cry from Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d isolationism. \u201cI\u2019m not against investment in other places, where it makes sense, if you\u2019re actually getting results and if you have national security interests that can be advanced. Because guess what? If we don\u2019t, China [will].\u201d\n\nPerino, it seems, is cut from a different conservative cloth than the man who now sits in the Oval Office. \u201cI just want everybody to get along,\u201d the Colorado native says at one point (imagine Trump ever saying that). She is less shouty than some of her Fox News colleagues who present evening opinion shows, such as chief Trump cheerleader Sean Hannity.\n\nFox and Trump have had a turbulent relationship over the years. Despite the network\u2019s biggest stars tending to share a hatred of the Democratic party \u2014 even though it now attracts a larger share of the Democrat audience than rivals such as CNN, according to Nielsen \u2014 the president has at various times accused the channel of being unfair to him or having an anti-Trump agenda. Which begs the question: given some of his more alarming policies (releasing convicted criminals who attacked the Capitol on January 6, being one) is Trump now to the right of Fox News? \u201cIt depends on what the right means now,\u201d Perino says, diplomatically.\n\nThe US is in the midst of a \u201cpolitical realignment\u201d, she adds, going on to mention previous eras, such as the 1970s, when southern Democrats drifted away from the party, eventually becoming Reagan Republicans. Today\u2019s Democrats have \u201clet the working class go\u201d, while Trump \u201cis a political phenomenon. I\u2019m certainly a conservative. I\u2019m a registered Republican. Would people that work for him consider me one of them? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWhat is Trump\u2019s relationship with Fox like these days? \u201cIt might depend on the day.\u201d She adds that his second term certainly will not be boring. \u201cI remember on a Saturday [in his first term] I took a nap for 20 minutes. That was it, and I woke up and three news stories had broken. During the Biden administration you could nap all day.\u201d\n\nFox News was the first outlet to raise questions about Biden\u2019s age affecting his mental acuity, which earned the channel the ire of Democrats. The great irony is that the Democrats are now beating themselves up over why he did not step down sooner, which would have allowed a proper primary to find the strongest candidate to run in his place.\n\n\u201cIt was what you were seeing with your own eyes,\u201d Perino says of Biden\u2019s decline. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t speculation. You could just see it when he would interact or when he would talk with the press. It was a problem.\u201d\n\nI wonder if Fox\u2019s reporting on this issue failed to take off in other parts of the press (Fox commentators tend to lump all other outlets together as the \u201cmainstream media\u201d) precisely because it came from the Murdoch-controlled channel and could therefore be dismissed as politically motivated.\n\nBut Perino changes tack to the campaign itself. \u201cThe other thing that was happening was that every poll said inflation is the number one issue for people, followed by immigration, and then crime. The voters were telling them what was wrong.\n\n\u201cClimate change might be the number one issue for 7 per cent of your voters,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf you focus on that solely and ignore these other things, ultimately you\u2019re going to lose.\u201d\n\nPerino then brings up border security. \u201cThe White House [would be] saying the border is secure and [Fox would have a] split-screen of people just walking across it. They missed that too. That really affected people.\u201d\n\nThe border is now the responsibility of the new administration, which continues to be assembled by Trump. At the time of publication only Marco Rubio\u2019s Senate confirmation as secretary of state has been smooth. Hegseth\u2019s nomination in particular sparked an outcry, with several news outlets publishing stories on alleged excessive drinking and aggressive behaviour: the Wall Street Journal, which, like Fox, is part of the Murdoch empire, recently reported he routinely passed out from alcohol abuse. (Hegseth has denied the allegations.)\n\nPerino says she \u201cnever worked with him that closely\u201d, adding the allegations \u201cdon\u2019t ring true to anything that I\u2019ve ever experienced. \u2018Give Pete a chance\u2019 is something I said that first day [he was nominated]. I know it\u2019s been a lot on his family, just from afar.\u201d\n\nShe went through a Senate confirmation process herself in 2010 when Barack Obama nominated her to join the Broadcasting Board of Governors. It was not \u201cvery controversial\u201d, she says of the experience, \u201cbut it\u2019s still a thing when your whole world is opened up to everybody\u201d.\n\nSince then, Perino\u2019s Fox career has grown and evolved: alongside America\u2019s Newsroom, which she co-anchors with Bill Hemmer, she is a co-host of the primetime show The Five, the most watched cable news show at 5pm. She has also developed Minute Mentoring, an organisation that helps women build leadership skills and advance their careers. She describes the approach as \u201clike speed dating, but mentoring\u201d.\n\nShe mentions a piece of advice she has given. \u201cI tell people, you\u2019re only allowed to have one drink at your office Christmas party. I don\u2019t care if you think you can handle four, you can\u2019t. One drink, that\u2019s it.\u201d Why? \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make a fool of yourself. You want to have a good showing in front of your boss at all times.\u201d Maybe Hegseth could have done with this advice, I suggest. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says sharply. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him drinking.\u201d\n\nOur time is almost up and before we part I want to know again where an internationalist conservative, who believes we have more common ground than we might think, fits in the new Trump era. \u201cI try to show people that we actually don\u2019t disagree that much,\u201d says Perino, referring again to the great political realignment wrought by the election result. There are some Trump policies that have merit, she adds, pointing to the need to drive more spending by Nato members and her view that the Department of Education needs reform to deliver better outcomes for children. But it does not sound like she has become a full-blown Maga member just yet.\n\nShe is ready for Trump 2.0 \u2014 and Fox News, she says, is the perfect perch. \u201cI think the great thing for me is I can just be myself.\u201d", "tag": "us?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3e2ab3ad-bc9c-46d5-b360-4876c10feeb9"}, {"uuid4": "65295c6a-3e43-461b-8d08-adbaa8bc7577", "title": "US agents begin arresting undocumented migrants in Chicago", "description": "Operation in Democrat-controlled \u2018sanctuary city\u2019 is part of Donald Trump\u2019s plan for mass deportations", "author": "Claire Bushey", "published_date": "2025-01-27T01:50:32.977Z", "content": "US immigration authorities began making arrests in Chicago on Sunday that targeted undocumented residents living in the \u201csanctuary city\u201d.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed on social media site X that its agents, along with several federal agencies including the FBI, had begun operations in the Midwestern city.

Mexicans comprise the largest group born outside the US, followed by people from India and Poland.\n\nAbout 52,000 immigrants have arrived in the city since August 2022, when Texas governor Greg Abbott began busing people from the border to Chicago, among other Democrat-controlled cities.\n\nAs a sanctuary city since the 1980s, Chicago has adopted policies that limit co-operation with federal authorities to enforce immigration law.\n\nThe City Council voted this month to reject a proposal that would have weakened those protections, and the Chicago Transit Authority is displaying ads at train and bus stations that direct riders to the city\u2019s \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d website, which lays out how to interact with immigration authorities.\n\nHoman has talked in recent months about \u201ccollateral\u201d arrests, detaining undocumented people if they are in the presence of someone ICE has a warrant to arrest. That would violate a 2022 court settlement and could make residents of certain states who are detained in such warrantless arrests eligible for immediate release from custody.\n\nOn Sunday, Homan agreed when McGraw, also known as \u201cDr Phil\u201d, suggested collateral arrests were the result of local authorities refusing to co-operate with ICE, prompting federal agents to make arrests in city neighbourhoods.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the game they want to play, game on, we\u2019re going to do it,\u201d said Homan.\n\nImmigration advocates fear the executive orders Trump issued last week constitute a large-scale attempt to dismantle due process protections.\n\nExpedited removal, which is the deportation of people without a judicial hearing or legal counsel, typically applies to people detained within 100 miles of the US border.\n\nTrump is attempting to extend it throughout the country for anyone who cannot prove to an ICE agent\u2019s satisfaction that they have resided in the US for at least two years.\n\nMary Meg McCarthy, executive director for the Chicago-based National Immigrant Justice Center, said many of the orders violated US law and the constitution.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric of \u201cfamiliar cruelty and dehumanisation\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009now paired with the full force of the executive branch and Congress, will unleash profound suffering on our longtime immigrant neighbours and people who have arrived more recently to seek refuge\u201d, she said.", "tag": "us?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/eedd75e9-db50-405f-a373-3a50194e3d47"}, {"uuid4": "4bf510dd-d928-43db-a111-13b6fe172632", "title": "Trump proposes \u2018clean out\u2019 of Gaza population", "description": "US president urges Egypt and Jordan to take in people from \u2018demolition site\u2019", "author": "Heba Saleh", "published_date": "2025-01-26T21:37:17.531Z", "content": "Donald Trump has urged Egypt and Jordan to take in most of the population of Gaza, saying it was time to \u201cclean out\u201d the territory in comments that are likely to outrage Palestinians and Arabs across the region.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like Egypt to take people.

The prewar population of Gaza was 2.2mn.\n\nAmman and Cairo have since the start of the war in October 2023 repeatedly rejected any transfer of Palestinians to their territories, saying it would amount to the \u201cliquidation of the Palestinian cause\u201d at the expense of Israel\u2019s neighbours.\n\nAyman Safadi, Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, said in remarks cited by Reuters that the kingdom\u2019s rejection of any displacement of the Palestinians was \u201cfirm and unwavering\u201d.

They may want to revise that view if the rollercoaster ride that is TikTok, now hurtling through the tunnel of the living dead, crashes into the buffers. Even big multinational companies, with 170mn enthusiastic users in the US, can become the plaything of politicians. And it is still far from clear how the saga is going to end.\n\nIronically, given his recent support for the company, Donald Trump was among the first to shout about the national security threat posed by TikTok during his first presidential term. In 2020, Trump issued an executive order threatening to ban the service. As the US offshoot of the Chinese-owned ByteDance, TikTok was seen by many politicians in Washington as a digital spy and potential Chinese Communist party propaganda tool. TikTok has since spent enormous time and resources on efforts to disprove these accusations, partnering with Oracle to ringfence the data of its US users and insisting on the impartiality of its algorithms.\n\nPoliticians on both sides of the congressional aisle have remained unimpressed. Last April, in a rare display of bipartisanship, the Senate voted, by a margin of 79 to 18, to approve legislation threatening to ban TikTok in the US unless ByteDance sold it. TikTok lobbied vigorously to overturn the law, arguing it would erode free speech and the business interests of millions of Americans.\n\nThis month, the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the company\u2019s pleas, backing Congress\u2019s \u201cwell-supported national security concerns\u201d. China has reacted with indignation, but Beijing itself firewalled most US platforms years ago, also ostensibly on national security grounds.\n\nBut TikTok had more success mobilising the support of its users and winning over the once-hostile Trump. Last June, the then presidential candidate launched his own TikTok account and now has more than 15mn followers. He has skilfully used the short-form video platform to target younger voters. TikTok\u2019s chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, was even given a prominent seat at Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nUpon re-entering the White House, Trump issued an executive order seeking to delay enforcement of the ban-or-divest law against TikTok that came into effect on January 19. But this executive order does not overturn the law, leaving the company, and the US platforms that host it, in legal limbo. Meanwhile, Trump appears to be using TikTok as a valuable pawn in a far bigger game with China. The president has suggested that if Beijing were to sell 50 per cent of TikTok to the US \u2014 though China has previously refused to countenance any kind of sale \u2014 then Washington might go easier on trade tariffs.\n\nIt is possible that Trump may yet seal an improbable deal keeping all parties happy. But it is hard to see how that will happen given the demands of China hawks in Washington to nullify any national security threat and TikTok\u2019s determination to keep its algorithms secret. The more likely outcome is that the president will try to strong-arm the business into the hands of an administration-friendly associate. Trump said this weekend that \u201cnumerous people\u201d had talked to him about buying the app and a decision was likely in the next 30 days.\n\nLast week, Trump urged global business leaders at Davos to step up investment in the US. But his history of highly transactional dealings will give them pause. Investors understandably prefer to operate within the bounds defined by laws, rights and institutions. The outcome of the TikTok dispute will show how far these still apply in the US.", "tag": "us?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0b21728f-1e6b-43c6-882e-ef8454f00940"}, {"uuid4": "c997daea-aa55-4527-aa5f-359e8a8ce1c0", "title": "Europe should stop panicking and seize the opportunities Trump offers", "description": "It is time for the EU to get down to business", "author": "Martin Sandbu", "published_date": "2025-01-26T12:00:51.666Z", "content": "FT readers are old enough to remember when Joe Biden committed hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to green technology \u2014 and Europe panicked. In the past week, Donald Trump has undone Biden\u2019s industrial policy, while promising huge investments in AI and fossil energy instead \u2014 and Europe is panicking again. No matter what a US president does, it seems, Europeans see an existential crisis.\n\nThis should give us some perspective on the \u201cpeak pessimism\u201d expressed in Davos. Perhaps, just perhaps, it reflects European attitudes more than it does the EU\u2019s objective prospects. That is not to deny that Trump\u2019s second administration will pose huge challenges to the bloc\u2019s economic and geopolitical model. But that model was already ripe for change. It would suit the EU to be more entrepreneurial about its fears, and use Trump\u2019s arrival as a source of opportunities \u2014 both to make it easier to make the changes that are long overdue, and to benefit from the harm the US is about to inflict on itself.\n\nStart with trade. Trump wants to shrink the US trade deficit with the EU. European leaders want to increase investment at home. These desires amount to the same thing. As EU leaders increasingly acknowledge, the EU\u2019s trade surplus is also a huge savings surplus exported to finance investments abroad. The penny needs to drop: redirecting these savings to domestic investments means leaving behind a growth model driven by export surpluses.\n\nThe understandable European instinct is to placate Trump and hope to salvage their US market access. But this instinct is obsolete. Learn instead from the more clear-eyed (everything is relative) strategy towards China: de-risk, though not decouple. The probable next German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, rightly warns companies reliant on China that they have to face the risks of disruption on their own. The same mindset can be extended to the US.\n\nThen there is defence. Europeans have to spend a lot more on this \u2014 not because the US president says so, but because Russian belligerence threatens their freedom. Trump\u2019s demand to raise defence spending to 5 per cent of GDP can, however, be the prod needed to break through political inertia, by shifting the question from whether to spend substantially more to how.\n\nIn the short run, this means more weapons purchases from US manufacturers \u2014 an easy promise to trade for other favours in Washington. In the medium run, ironically, it could lead to the opposite, as European arms producers get the certainty of sustained and higher demand \u2014 especially if their governments finally manage to standardise specifications and procure jointly.\n\nEnergy is next. The EU struggles with high energy prices, and hasn\u2019t managed to give up Russian pipeline oil and liquefied gas. Trump would like nothing more than boosting oil and gas sales to Europe. The quickest way to achieve this would be to complete the EU\u2019s sanctions against buying Russian fossil fuels \u2014 but this requires unanimity, which Russia-friendly member states resist. The smart thing to do is request a helping hand from Trump by pointing out that it\u2019s his own admirers, from Budapest to Bratislava, who stand in the way of a bigger order book.\n\nIn addition to a political springboard to realise existing European priorities, Trump\u2019s disruption also offers new opportunities to exploit. If Biden\u2019s subsidies for renewables and green tech sucked investment from Europe to the US, then today\u2019s about-face must logically do the opposite. More likely, those fears were always overdone. But the Maga antipathy for anything green strengthens the case for doubling down on incentives to make more profitable in Europe the decarbonisation investments that have just become less profitable in the US.\n\nThink about immigration, too. For a long time Europe has bled talent to the US, and the shortage of qualified staff is a common complaint from high-tech businesses. If Maga America proves too extreme for the world\u2019s young well-educated workers (and the UK remains neuralgic about immigration), an EU that throws its doors open could become a global pole of attraction. High-skilled immigration schemes that allow movement between EU states, such as the Blue Card initiative, should be enhanced, perhaps in conjunction with the pan-European legal framework for innovative companies that European tech has asked for and Brussels has promised to deliver.\n\nEurope should heed the words of an earlier US president: it has nothing to fear but fear itself. The best response to Trumpian aggression is to use it to make Europe great again.\n\nmartin.sandbu@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/05a41924-b5be-41dd-aaae-89121b4ac146"}, {"uuid4": "e38251c1-c933-4084-9a8d-85bc83c7c02d", "title": "Will the Federal Reserve respond to Donald Trump\u2019s call on interest rates?", "description": "Market Questions is the FT\u2019s guide to the week ahead", "author": "Jennifer Hughes", "published_date": "2025-01-26T12:00:51.662Z", "content": "The Federal Reserve is not expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday but the US central bank\u2019s policy is already under scrutiny from President Donald Trump.\n\nInvestors overwhelmingly expect the Fed to hold rates at their current level of 4.25-4.5 per cent, after three consecutive cuts since September.\n\nAttention will focus on any shift in outlook from the accompanying statement, and on remarks from chair Jay Powell in the subsequent press conference.\n\nIn December the Fed signalled a likely pause in rate cuts and said it would consider the \u201cextent and timing\u201d of any further changes.

If confirmed, that would be the fifth such reduction since June and would take the key deposit rate to 2.75 per cent, the lowest level in almost two years and 1.25 percentage points lower than at its peak in 2024.\n\nIn doing so, markets expect the ECB to discount December\u2019s jump in annual inflation back to 2.4 per cent. It is confident that annual price increases this year will be close to its medium-term target of 2 per cent, while economic growth is likely to disappoint.\n\nBut almost half of the 72 participants in a Financial Times survey among European economists said that the ECB had been too slow in lowering rates.\n\n\u201cWe do not see ourselves behind the curve,\u201d Lagarde told CNBC in an interview in Davos this week where she attended the World Economic Forum.\n\nTraders are expecting two or three further quarter-point cuts this year, according to levels implied by swaps markets.\n\nWith the US Fed becoming much more hawkish in December, a growing transatlantic gap in monetary policy appears to be opening up.\n\nLagarde told CNBC that the ECB was not \u201coverly concerned\u201d about potential repercussions for Europe from a potential uptick in inflation in the US. Olaf Storbeck\n\nTraders are widely expecting the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates by a quarter point at Wednesday\u2019s policy-setting meeting but a small question mark remains, given recent trends in economic data.\n\nSwaps markets are pricing in a 90 per cent probability the central bank will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3 per cent from 3.25 per cent.\n\nBut when the Bank of Canada took half a percentage point off its overnight rate in December for the second meeting in a row, responding to weaker than expected economic growth, deliberations from its governing council showed that the decision between a quarter-point and half-point cut was a \u201cclose call\u201d given mixed data and noted the \u201csubstantial\u201d cumulation of recent reductions.\n\nMembers would be evaluating the need for further reductions in the policy rate \u201cone meeting at a time\u201d, the bank said in a summary of their deliberations, and \u201cexpected a more gradual approach to monetary policy going forward\u201d.\n\nData since then show that Canada\u2019s economy was growing \u201croughly in line\u201d with the central bank\u2019s forecast, according to Capital Economics. It also highlighted inflation data for December, that while including a decline to 1.8 per cent in the headline rate, indicated that a measure of underlying inflation trends was \u201cuncomfortably high\u201d.\n\nSuch pressures could give the central bank, which has also cited uncertainty created by the new US administration, the grounds to pause its rate cuts.\n\n\u201cWith tariffs clouding the economic outlook, we judge that the governing council will opt for a [quarter-point] policy rate cut,\u201d said Thomas Ryan, North America economist at Capital Economics.

After leaving as FTC chair on Monday, Khan warned against reverting to what she sees as lax antitrust enforcement that for decades let businesses grow unchecked.\n\nKhan cautioned that \u201cin our democracy right now there is an open question\u201d on whether \u201cmonopolists in extraordinarily powerful firms are going to be able to corrupt the political process and interfere with legitimate law enforcement\u201d.\n\nHer comments echo the alarm sounded by Biden during his farewell address, in which he warned that an \u201coligarchy is taking shape in America\u201d that risks damaging democracy. Biden railed against an emerging \u201ctech industrial complex\u201d for holding a \u201cdangerous concentration\u201d of wealth and power in the country.\n\nHis speech was broadly seen as a broadside against business magnates who have cozied up to US President Donald Trump, including Tesla boss Elon Musk and other Big Tech CEOs.\n\nTech chief executives, including Musk, Amazon executive chair and founder Jeff Bezos and Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, sat in prominent seats in front of the president\u2019s cabinet nominees at Trump\u2019s inauguration this week.\n\nAmazon and Meta, whose FTC trials will begin in October 2026 and April, respectively, each donated $1mn to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund, alongside other tech groups.\n\nBig Tech was a critical pillar of Khan\u2019s agenda. She launched an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s cloud business as well as an inquiry into the partnerships between cloud providers and generative AI companies.\n\nIn private equity, a key focus was roll-ups in the healthcare sector. She argued that these roll-ups \u2014 in which companies purchase and merge several businesses in the same sector \u2014 and \u201cstrip and flip\u201d models \u2014 where the acquired groups\u2019 assets are sold off \u2014 often leave those businesses indebted and weakened.\n\n\u201cI heard a flood of concern from healthcare workers, from ER doctors\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009about the private equity roll-ups that were resulting in worse quality care, higher prices,\u201d Khan said.\n\n\u201cThese are just market realities that are not going away,\u201d she added.\n\nJust days before Khan\u2019s resignation, the FTC reached a settlement with Welsh, Carson, Anderson, and Stowe that limits the buyout group\u2019s involvement with a business it created that has acquired more than a dozen anaesthesiology practices in Texas.

Do I need to go tell my CEO his tax rate may double?\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump advisers had promised to \u201cflood the zone\u201d with executive actions, partly to keep opponents on the back foot. Consultancies, law firms and investment banks built elaborate plans to monitor the orders and isolate salient points for clients.\n\n\u201cWhere there\u2019s a wealth of information, there\u2019s often a poverty of attention,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist at consultancy Penta Group, which set up a \u201cwar room\u201d to follow the pronouncements. \u201cThe challenge for corporate leaders is prioritising all this information and activity.\u201d\n\nNowhere was that more evident than in the energy sector, after Trump invoked emergency powers to clear regulatory obstacles to fossil fuel projects and rescinded many of his predecessor\u2019s executive actions.\n\nHe also shocked the clean energy industry with a demonstration of how the executive branch could undermine funding apparently mandated by Congress. One order halted loans offered to developers and manufacturers under the Inflation Reduction Act and bipartisan infrastructure law. The means to unlock that money are now unclear and may get tangled up in broader congressional negotiations to revise the IRA.\n\nWilliam Oplinger, chief executive of US aluminium producer Alcoa, said his company\u2019s two domestic smelters could be at risk if tax credits were cut.\n\nThe support \u201chas allowed those facilities to continue operating in the current environment\u201d, he said, adding that the company would determine their long-term viability when it was clear what any IRA changes would mean and if there were additional impacts from tariffs.\n\nWind power took a particularly heavy blow as a result of orders that froze leasing approvals and triggered immediate review of permitting practices, which cover existing projects.\n\nSome companies are racing to appoint Republican-linked lobbying firms they hope have the ear of the administration. Federal disclosures show renewable energy developers EnergyRe and NextEra hired Polaris Government Relations last month.\n\nTrump\u2019s energy orders bore resemblance to a five-point road map proposed last summer by the American Petroleum Institute, the fossil fuel producers\u2019 lobby group. Mike Sommers, API chief executive, said the institute was now moving to influence the implementation of policy.\n\n\u201cA lot of these executive orders are directing agencies to do things, but many of these agencies don\u2019t even have secretaries now,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is fill in the blanks for the new department heads, so they know precisely how to implement the president\u2019s vision.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump did not fulfil a promise to impose new tariffs on US trading partners on \u201cday one\u201d, an executive memo ordered departmental reviews of existing trade practices, with a deadline of April 1. He also indicated at a press conference that he could hit Mexico, Canada and China with tariffs on February 1.\n\nEvan Giesemann, an adviser on tax and trade at EY, told clients in a Wednesday webinar: \u201cWhile nothing with President Trump is final until it is implemented\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I can\u2019t underscore enough how wide a net this memo casts, showing how serious he is about making structural changes to our trade policies and fairly quickly.\u201d\n\nIn some quarters, the executive actions crystallised concern that new tariffs, along with the potential deportation of a portion of the US labour force, could stoke inflation and limit the Federal Reserve\u2019s room to cut interest rates.\n\nCarole Streicher, deal advisory leader for KPMG in the US, suspected that concern was behind the spike this week in incoming calls from private equity-owned companies about starting a sale process.\n\n\u201cMany are sitting on the starting line ready to have the gun go off,\u201d she said. \u201cThe discussion now is whether there is a short window for the next three to six months where interest rates are going to be at their current level and we need to transact before that window closes.\u201d\n\nThe executive actions also appear likely to accelerate companies\u2019 recasting of diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. Trump ordered government agencies to draw up lists of \u201cthe most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners in each sector of concern\u201d and propose \u201cup to nine potential civil compliance investigations\u201d of public companies and other organisations.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re bullying American employers into backing away from what are otherwise fully lawful efforts,\u201d said Jenny Yang, former commissioner at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, now partner at the consultancy Working Ideal.\n\nYang said many companies had examined their DEI policies to check they were watertight, but law firms were sending urgent bulletins to clients offering legal audits. The retailer Target on Friday became the latest company to row back previous DEI commitments.\n\nTD Cowen\u2019s Krueger said this week\u2019s executive actions had come \u201cat record speed and with record breadth\u201d, with much still to digest and many questions unanswered. \u201cBut at least now pre-season is over,\u201d he said. \u201cNow you can start putting pen to paper on policy.\u201d", "tag": "us?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3af7a758-d161-4dc7-998f-8872f17cf617"}, {"uuid4": "777e2a52-8fdc-4410-9112-762d674c3591", "title": "The world is moving on to trade without the US", "description": "Many nations have been responding to Trump tariffs not by retaliating but by courting other trade partners", "author": "Ruchir Sharma", "published_date": "2025-01-26T05:00:51.431Z", "content": "The writer is chair of Rockefeller International. His latest book is \u2018What Went Wrong With Capitalism\u2019\n\nWhile Donald Trump has yet to act on his multiple tariff threats, it\u2019s likely he will. So the fear lingers that the US president\u2019s aggressive trade posture will sow global disorder, depressing growth and roiling markets, particularly if targeted nations retaliate.\n\nBut retaliation is not the only or even the most likely response to Trump, no matter how broadly he finally delivers on his threats.\n\nThe US has wielded tariffs as a weapon for eight years now. Those imposed by Trump in his first term were mostly continued or \u2014 in the case of China \u2014 expanded by Joe Biden. Some nations retaliated; others offered concessions or challenged them before global trade arbiters. But most just quietly moved on, seeking trade with countries other than the US.\n\nSince 2017, Trump\u2019s first year in office, trade has held more or less steady at just under 60 per cent of global GDP. But there\u2019s been a decline in the US share of trade flows offset by an increase in other regions, particularly the nations of Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Trump 2.0 seems likely to bring more of the same: trade without America.\n\nOver the past eight years, more than four of every five nations \u2014 developed and developing \u2014 have seen trade rise as a share of their national GDP. Gains of more than 10 percentage points have been chalked up in more than a dozen major nations, from Japan, Italy and Sweden to Vietnam, Greece and Turkey. The big exception is the US, where it has dipped to around 25 per cent of GDP. The US has been growing faster than most of its peers \u2014 but with no boost from trade.\n\nAmerica may be increasingly dominant as a financial and economic superpower but not so much as a trading power. Its share of global equity indices has exploded to almost 70 per cent. Its share of global GDP has inched up to more than 25 per cent. Yet its share of global trade is under 15 per cent, and has declined significantly in the last eight years.\n\nMany of the warnings about Trump\u2019s impact focus on how new tariffs could hurt exporting nations that rely on the US as their main customer. But during Trump\u2019s first term, before the pandemic and despite his tariff offensive, developed nations saw stable growth and developing ones saw a strong acceleration in exports of both goods (led by tech products and commodities) and services (led by transport and digital services).\n\nGlobal trade talks had fallen apart after 2008, as tensions stirred up by the financial crisis that year made vast multi-nation deals too difficult to conclude. But many nations continued to pursue smaller deals. The number of bilateral and regional agreements rose steadily, with fresh impetus after Trump first took office, and soon styled himself \u201ctariff man\u201d.\n\nThe US became an outlier, looking on as others cultivated the art of the trade deal. Since 2017, the US has abandoned talks on partnerships with the EU and Asia, and cut not a single new trade deal. Meanwhile, the EU has negotiated eight agreements and China has concluded nine, including a landmark 15-nation partnership in Asia.\n\nBy late last year, dealmaking picked up anew as the start of Trump\u2019s second presidency approached. The EU rushed to finish the outline of a difficult agreement \u2014 25 years in the making \u2014 with members of the Mercosur alliance in South America, followed by one with Mexico. Now, Mexico is hurrying to widen trade ties with fellow nations in Latin America, in part as insurance against what Trump might do next.\n\nThe result: over the past eight years, as the locus of global trade shifted away from the US and towards the Middle East, Europe and Asia, nations registering big share gains included the United Arab Emirates, Poland and, above all, China. Of the 10 fastest-growing trade corridors, five have one terminus in China; only two have a terminus in the US.\n\nTrump says tariffs will command respect, and help restore US power. But there\u2019s another risk worth considering. The new president\u2019s brand of populism vows to free the US from heavy government intervention through taxes and regulations, but tariffs are another form \u2014 and equally subject to the laws of unintended consequences.\n\nTo date, the \u201cAmerica first\u201d tariff regime has done less to damage its prime target, China, than to compel US allies to look elsewhere for trade. So the risk of even broader tariffs may be less about triggering trade wars than undermining US relevance as a trading power, and eventually sapping its economic prowess.", "tag": "us?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/07eac548-6607-4c88-bfe3-4f1d6e3b8cf2"}, {"uuid4": "c2dd0006-a967-4a66-9d2e-79fef8e508ae", "title": "\u2018Grossly irresponsible\u2019: health experts urge US to control bird flu", "description": "Call for stronger action comes on warning of growing risk the virus will evolve to spread more easily between humans", "author": "Michael Peel", "published_date": "2025-01-26T05:00:51.372Z", "content": "The US must strengthen measures to control the country\u2019s bird flu outbreak and curb the growing risk that the virus will evolve to spread more easily between humans, international health experts have warned.\n\nScientists have called for increased vaccination of farm workers and more efforts to stem the spread among farm animals as the H5N1 pathogen continues to infect cattle and chickens across the country.\n\nThe epidemic is an early test for President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, which is already scaling back commitments to global efforts on disease control and prevention.\n\n\u201cIt is arguably grossly irresponsible for the US authorities to allow such sustained high level of virus transmission in dairy cattle as this poses such a major threat to global human health,\u201d said Professor James Wood, an infectious diseases expert at the UK\u2019s Cambridge university.\n\nHe added that curbs such as stricter movement of cattle \u201cwould hugely reduce human exposure and would be expected in every other country\u201d.\n\nExperts have watched with growing alarm as H5N1 has circulated in the US for more than nine months. The outbreak has resulted in 67 confirmed human cases, mostly in people who work with cattle and chickens, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe first fatality was reported this month, although no cases of human to human transmission have yet been documented.\n\nVirologists fear a reassortment of genetic material from the H5N1 pathogen with another animal or human flu, creating a new virus that is more likely to be transmitted between people. The possibility of this scenario rises as H5N1 circulates in the US during the winter flu season.\n\nThere were an estimated 12mn-22mn human flu cases between October 1 and January 11, according to the CDC. On January 16, it urged hospitals to analyse within 24 hours whether flu sufferers actually contracted bird flu, particularly if patients were in intensive care.\u00a0The CDC said in November it had provided human flu vaccines to farm workers in 12 states.\n\nIt considered H5N1\u2019s risk to the public to be low, but added that it was \u201cclosely monitoring this dynamic situation\u201d.\n\nThe World Organisation for Animal Health, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization have said governments should step up several measures to combat the spread of bird flu. These include strengthening virus testing, sequencing and data sharing, improving farm biosecurity and protecting people who were exposed to infected animals, said Maria Van Kerkhove, a top WHO official.\n\n\u201cMore can and should be done to reduce the spread of avian influenza in animals, between different animal species and to humans,\u201d said Van Kerkhove, who is acting director of pandemic preparedness.\n\nThe WHO encourages work on developing animal vaccines and their potential use to reduce bird flu\u2019s spread, Van Kerkhove added.\n\nThe three leading makers of bird flu vaccines for humans \u2014 CSL Seqirus, Sanofi and GSK \u2014 are well placed to respond if the outbreak becomes a pandemic. In October, the trio signed a $72mn agreement with the US government that included commitments to prepare to distribute doses quickly and sustain supply levels.\n\nThe US government on January 17 gave $590mn to Moderna, which is developing a flu vaccine using similar messenger RNA-based technology as its Covid jab.\n\nThe Seqirus jab has been ordered by many European governments but Finland is the only one to have confirmed it is using the vaccines to inoculate farmworkers. The vaccine maker said the Nordic country was also conducting its own independent study on the jab\u2019s safety and efficacy.\n\nThe US response to bird flu has been further complicated by a \u201cshort pause\u201d placed on \u201cmass communications and public appearances that are not directly related to emergencies or critical to preserving health\u201d by the health and human services department and other bodies.\n\nThe Trump administration initiated the pause to \u201cset up a process for review and prioritisation\u201d, the health department said.\n\nTrump and his allies are critical of fundamental aspects of international disease control, while Robert F Kennedy Jr, his nominee for health and human services secretary, is a long-standing vaccine sceptic.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s first actions after his inauguration was to trigger the year-long process to pull the US out of the WHO.\u00a0He took the same action in 2020 during his previous term, but president Joe Biden reversed the decision on taking office in January 2021.\n\nData visualisation by Bob Haslett\n\nThis piece has been updated to clarify the WHO\u2019s position on animal vaccines for bird flu.", "tag": "us?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8eb284d4-d853-4a0a-a8c0-5173d1a6d666"}, {"uuid4": "107866c1-88ff-42c0-b4ba-2d2e1acf0686", "title": "US officials push to exempt Ukraine from Rubio\u2019s foreign aid freeze\u00a0", "description": "Support for schools, hospitals and economic development in Ukraine at risk from Trump administration\u2019s order", "author": "Christopher Miller", "published_date": "2025-01-25T19:46:52.700Z", "content": "US diplomats have requested an urgent exemption for Ukraine-related programmes from a 90-day freeze on foreign aid and \u201cstop work\u201d orders issued by secretary of state Marco Rubio, according to documents seen by the Financial Times and people familiar with the matter.\n\nCiting national security concerns, senior diplomats in the state department\u2019s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs have asked Rubio to grant a full waiver to exclude the work of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in Ukraine from the sweeping directive that came into effect immediately after being issued on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe do not know at this time whether this request will be approved \u2014 in whole or in part \u2014 but there are positive signals thus far out of Washington,\u201d said an email sent to USAID staff in Ukraine on Saturday that was reviewed by the FT.\n\nUSAID in Ukraine has temporarily held off issuing \u201cstop work\u201d orders while the exemption request\u00a0is being considered, according to the email and officials at some of those partner organisations.\n\nThe agency has also asked staff to assess programmes \u201cand find ways for them to more clearly support the secretary of state\u2019s directive to make the US safer, stronger and more prosperous\u201d.\n\nBut by Saturday evening in Kyiv, some organisations began receiving \u201cstop work\u201d orders.\n\nOne such order shared by an organisation with the FT ordered \u201cthe contractor to immediately stop work under the USAID/Ukraine contract/task order\u201d the organisation had been awarded.\n\nThe order said the contractor \u201cshall not resume work\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009until notification has been received in writing from the Contracting Officer that this Stop Work Order has been cancelled\u201d.\n\nThe state department, USAID and US embassy in Kyiv did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn an internal cable sent on Friday to the state department and USAID, obtained by the FT, Rubio instructed that all new foreign aid disbursements be suspended.

But the cable does not mention such an exemption for Ukraine, which relies on Washington for military aid to fight Russia.\n\nThe state department and US embassy in Kyiv did not respond to requests to clarify Rubio\u2019s directive as it pertains to new military aid for Ukraine.\n\nHowever, a Ukrainian government official with knowledge of the matter confirmed to the FT that US military assistance did not fall under the freeze order. \u201cMilitary aid to Ukraine is intact,\u201d the official said. \u201cAt least as of now, and it is certainly not part of this 90-day freeze.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at a\u00a0press conference alongside visiting Moldovan President Maia Sandu in Kyiv on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that American arms had not stopped flowing to his country.\n\n\u201cI am focused on military aid; it has not been stopped, thank God,\u201d he said.\n\nThe US has provided $65.9bn in military aid to Kyiv since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, according to state department statistics.\n\nTrump has been sceptical of US military aid to Ukraine and derided Zelenskyy as \u201cthe greatest salesman on earth\u201d for his efforts to secure billions of dollars' worth of arms and ammunition.\n\nTrump said this week that he wanted to broker a \u201cdeal\u201d between Kyiv and Moscow to end the war.

A young woman \u2014 as far away as India \u2014 feels the pull of Lady Liberty\u2019s lifted torch in New York Harbour and crosses the globe to make a new life. She knows her path won\u2019t be straightforward \u2014 but also that the Big Apple is the place to support and nurture her dreams.\n\nKay Sohini\u2019s graphic memoir This Beautiful, Ridiculous City, is a praise-song to her adopted home.\u00a0Raised in the suburbs of Kolkata and given an English education, the young Sohini read Jack Kerouac, Joan Didion and Alison Bechdel and dreamt always of New York. When she finally moved to the city, leaving behind an abusive relationship, she felt she already belonged. At the same time however, Sohini refuses to look away from the city\u2019s flaws, from the damage its ruthless metamorphoses can inflict.\n\nIn the days before the inauguration of the 47th President of the United States some of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have made their way to the city \u2014 which has a legal obligation to provide shelter to anyone who asks \u2014 have begun to flee, fearing Donald Trump\u2019s threatened deportations. The city, undoubtedly, has creaked under the weight of open-palmed welcome; Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 chaotic administration (with the mayor himself under federal indictment and with many of his top officials having resigned amid a torrent of investigations) hasn\u2019t helped matters.\n\nYet the city that never sleeps has survived plenty worse, and Sohini\u2019s book, with its glorious, candy-coloured drawings of the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station and the Gimbels Skybridge, presents its allure in a fresh, enchanting way, while also offering a reminder that Sohini is one of a long line of women who have found themselves in the city, made their mark, remade themselves. She loves New York for \u201cthe stories it is home to, the creativity it lends to passers-by when the mind is desolate. It is about drawing pleasure from proximity. To possibilities, to art, architecture, culture, history, luxury.\u201d\n\nIn this she is not so far removed from the writer and raconteur Fran Lebowitz \u2014 the professional New Yorker whose fame increased exponentially with the release of Martin Scorsese\u2019s 2021 documentary Pretend It\u2019s a City. As she has it in her author biography: \u201cLebowitz lives in New York City, as she does not believe she would be allowed to live anywhere else.\u201d Lebowitz is of course herself an immigrant to New York, albeit one from just across the river in New Jersey. But to New Yorkers, that\u2019s far enough.\n\nThe struggle to be a New Yorker is real. Although Sohini is captivated by Manhattan, she finds a place to live in Queens, a fair few subway stops from the landmarks she draws with such care and affection. This moving, optimistic book doesn\u2019t shrink from economic reality, as she watches local residents being displaced from her neighbourhood as the outer boroughs gentrify too.\n\n\u201cWith the median house price hovering around $700,000, homeownership is a pipedream to many. Nearly 70% of the city\u2019s eight and a quarter million people are renters.\u201d She draws the facade of a red-brick apartment building, beautifully restored and for that very reason forbidding: \u201cNew York is increasingly a city for the very moneyed,\u201d reads the text that runs across the brick. \u201cIt makes less and less space for those with little or modest means.\u201d\n\nNot long ago, the city seemed \u2014 just \u2014 somewhat more accommodating to those who would see in Lady Liberty not just as a beacon but a mirror too. I read Sohini\u2019s memoir alongside Vivian Gornick\u2019s striking memoir, The Odd Woman and the City \u2014 first published in the US a decade ago, but only now appearing in Britain \u2014 and Elaine Kraf\u2019s eccentric, compelling novel The Princess of 72nd Street. Put all these alongside Virago\u2019s new edition of The Fran Lebowitz Reader and you have a shelf of works that offer a multi-faceted portrait of what it means to be a woman in New York.\n\nGornick, long a writer for the storied Village Voice and the author of Fierce Attachments (lauded as the best memoir of the past 50 years by the New York Times Book Review) takes her title from George Gissing\u2019s 1893 novel The Odd Women \u2014 a proto-feminist text, if you like, considering as it does the costs of \u201crespectability\u201d for women\u2019s lives. Gornick sets her sights on the three elements defining her existence: her reach for friendship, her desire for romantic love and, most powerful of all, the rhythms of the city she calls home.\n\nShe is \u201ca walker in the city\u201d, one of those who feeds \u201cthe never-ending stream of the never-ending crowd that is certainly imprinting on someone\u2019s creativity\u201d. Gornick treks the length of the island with her friend Leonard; along the way she records her encounters and recalls her failed love affairs.\n\nThe streets and avenues sustain her, the risks and possibilities of the place never permitting the finality of despair. At the end of this brief, peculiarly arresting book she sits down to a solitary dinner and recalls all the New Yorkers who have crossed her path that day. \u201cI hear their voices, I see their gestures, I start filling in lives for them. Soon they are company, great company.\u201d In New York, phantom companionship is companionship all the same.\n\nGornick quotes a letter by the poet and critic Louise Bogan that describes the West 70s in Manhattan as \u201cthat area which absorbs the queer, the old, the failures, into furnished or hotel rooms, and adds gloom to their decay\u201d. Like so much of Manhattan, this part of the Upper West Side has been ruthlessly gentrified; there\u2019s very little room for failures there these days. That raffish neighbourhood was at the tail-end of its existence in 1979, when Elaine Kraf\u2019s cult classic The Princess of 72nd Street first appeared.\n\nKraf was a writer and painter; the author of four published works of fiction, as well as much work that never made it into the public sphere, she died in 2013. The Princess of 72nd Street is narrated by Ellen, an artist gifted with episodes she calls \u201cradiances\u201d. \u201cI am glad I have the radiance,\u201d the novel begins.\n\nIt is these radiances that enable her to become Esmerelda, the Princess of 72nd Street, glorious in a long skirt, patterned with \u201ccascades of color\u201d, a great amulet hung from her neck \u2014 sometimes a cross, sometimes a Star of David, sometimes an Egyptian ankh \u2014 and her \u201cglittering eyes\u201d painted Cleopatra-style.\n\nEllen/Esmerelda fights to preserve her independence against the tides of control: the men who want to sleep with her, the doctors who want to medicate her. Her radiances are perhaps bipolar episodes, if we\u2019re going to try clinical language: but this slender novel immerses us in the brilliance of its world so we feel as far from madness as its protagonist does.\n\nComparisons have been made to the work of Jean Rhys; I thought too of Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar and Leonora Carrington\u2019s The Hearing Trumpet. In the Princess\u2019s consciousness, the ecosystem of the Upper West Side depends on her magnanimous rule: \u201cIf I should move away it would fall apart.\u201d She describes with loving care its tattered, accessible charm. \u201cTomatoes and radishes grow in boxes placed on dirty windowsills. A tan can be gotten free in Riverside Park, and there are always places open for late night wanderers.\u201d\n\nThe women in these books seem irrefutably modern: yet this is a modernity that New York has long offered, even in an unlikely way. For there sits Catherine Sloper, settled on \u201cthe chaste upholstery of a New York drawing-room\u201d in Henry James\u2019s brief, intimate novel Washington Square, first published in 1880. In those days, her widower father\u2019s grand mansion was \u201cup town\u201d, away from the hustle and bustle of lower Manhattan. The same year the book came out, construction began on an apartment building so far uptown it was seen to be in a veritable wilderness \u2014 and nicknamed the Dakota as a result.\n\nIn Washington Square poor Catherine is pitied by Dr Sloper, mired in grief after the loss of his wife; she appears at first to be the victim of her father\u2019s disregard and her aunt\u2019s romantic machinations. Catherine\u2019s Washington Square mansion might seem to be a prison; certainly, she is trapped by the morals and mores of her time. But the novel\u2019s end finds Catherine serene in her solitude, a mistress of the city in her own quiet way.\n\nNew York\u2019s constant reinvention should make it feel precarious; instead, it delivers a unique sense of permanence, allowing those who find a foothold \u2014 not least women on their own \u2014 to discover a sense of permission unavailable elsewhere. This beautiful, ridiculous city, indeed.\n\nEach of these books demonstrates that no matter the cost of living, no matter how broken the subway or how much garbage is piled in the street, New York still exerts its glorious pull \u2014 somehow makes room for those who would hear its siren jazz. A hell of a town, just like the song says.\n\nThis Beautiful, Ridiculous City: A Graphic Memoir by Kay Sohini Jonathan Cape \u00a320, 128 pages\n\nThe Odd Woman and the City: A Memoir by Vivian Gornick Daunt Books \u00a310.99, 184 pages\n\nThe Princess of 72nd Street by Elaine Kraf Penguin Modern Classics \u00a39.99, 160 pages\n\nThe Fran Lebowitz Reader by Fran Lebowitz Virago \u00a310.99, 336 pages\n\nJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Caf\u00e9 and follow FT Weekend on Instagram and\u00a0X", "tag": "us?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b76cd423-0925-4616-91c5-adc61671283d"}, {"uuid4": "17ad9643-a6ab-4181-9901-4f91cfc886ea", "title": "Cecile Richards, reproductive rights activist, 1957-2025", "description": "She became a household name as leader of Planned Parenthood, a target for the US conservative right", "author": "Madison Darbyshire", "published_date": "2025-01-25T05:00:52.337Z", "content": "Cecile Richards first noticed that something fundamental had shifted in America\u2019s politics more than 30 years ago. After her mother, the progressive Texas governor Ann Richards, was defeated in her 1994 bid for re-election by future president George W Bush, the younger Richards was troubled by what she had seen on the campaign trail.\n\nThe longtime community and union organiser, who has died aged 67, told The Dallas Morning News in 1996: \u201cThe whole tone and feeling about politics had changed, just in four years.\u201d She said: \u201cI was really concerned that people were feeling very hateful. They were on a mission to eradicate these \u2018godless, anti-family officials\u2019 they thought were ruining the country.\u201d\n\nAlarmed by the rising political influence of the religious right in Texas, Richards formed the advocacy organisation Texas Freedom Network. She told the paper that she realised that to do nothing would be worse than failure.\n\nThat would become a constant refrain throughout her life as she became one of the most recognisable progressive figures in America. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine future generations one day asking, \u2018When there was so much at stake for our country, what did you do?\u2019\u201d she often repeated. \u201cThe only acceptable answer is: \u2018Everything we could.\u2019\u201d\n\nBorn in Waco, Texas, in 1957, the eldest of four children, Richards grew up steeped in progressive values. Still, her parents, a teacher who later entered politics, and a civil rights lawyer, were surprised when aged 13 she was sent home from school for wearing a black armband to protest against the Vietnam war. In college she helped organise the school\u2019s janitorial staff and later worked with garment workers in Guatemala.\n\nRichards moved deeper into politics, campaigning for her mother while heavily pregnant with twins, and later gaining a reputation as a highly effective political operative when deputy chief of staff to Nancy Pelosi. She became a household name in the US for her work as the leader of Planned Parenthood, which provides affordable family planning and birth control, cancer screenings, STD testing and, in some clinics, abortion services. During 12 years at the helm she turned the healthcare provider into a political powerhouse. When she left in 2018, supporters and volunteers had more than tripled to 11mn people, and unintended pregnancies in the US hit a 30-year low.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, a flashpoint since its founding more than 100 years ago, has been increasingly embattled in recent decades. Richards\u2019 2006 appointment was a tacit acknowledgment that reproductive healthcare, bodily autonomy and abortion access in the US had entered a new era of politicisation. The organisation became a political firebrand for the conservative right, a proxy for women\u2019s bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom. \u201cThe goal here is they want to end access to safe and legal abortion in America,\u201d Richards told The New York Times in 2017, \u201cand the way they do that is by going after Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nRichards was beloved by progressives, a highly charismatic, energetic leader who never compromised her values for political expediency. She was also a firm believer in the power of personal narratives to destigmatise abortion. The mother of three was open about her own decision to undergo the procedure but often declined to elaborate further, emphasising the crucial difference between giving women the freedom to share their experience and forcing them to justify their decision.\n\nIn a 2022 article for The New York Times, Richards reflected on her leadership at the organisation. She regretted believing that providing quality healthcare and having the majority of America\u2019s support would be enough. \u201cI wasn\u2019t cynical enough to fully comprehend the extent of the Republican Party\u2019s willingness to trade away people\u2019s lives for political power,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Roe vs Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court in June 2022 and abortion access in much of the US crumbled overnight, Richards helped launch a chatbot to provide Americans with accurate, confidential information about accessing abortion care.\n\nShe continued to fight for progressive causes even after her diagnosis of brain cancer in 2023, knowing she had no time to waste. She drew on her mother\u2019s wisdom often during this time, she said. Although it was a mantra she had repeated innumerable times, Richards would phrase it as a question, as if she could have forgotten: \u201cWhat was Mom\u2019s line?

The local identity is neither British nor Chinese, difficult to substitute or erase, and distinctively of its place.\n\nFew things symbolise Hong Kong\u2019s fusion of flavours more than the local diners known as cha chaan tengs, or \u201ctea restaurants\u201d. These humble caf\u00e9s serve a mix of western imports \u2014 French toast is popular \u2014 alongside Chinese dishes such as salted fish and chicken fried rice, and a wide array of local inventions combining the two that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else, such as the ubiquitous macaroni and ham soup. They are also characterised by their efficient, no-frills service and frenetic, chaotic atmosphere \u2014 typical attributes of Hong Kong life, where every minute is precious and counted.\n\nThe predecessor of the cha chaan teng is the bing sutt, or ice room. Originally from Guangzhou in the 1880s, they were places to enjoy chilled refreshments, their popularity largely attributed to the influx of western expats. The cha chaan teng was a product of that growing demand, offering an affordable alternative to the more opulent cuisine of the British colonial rulers. Today, the cha chaan teng is where blue-collar workers share tables with bankers and lawyers. Its fare has become what a full English is in England or a hamburger in the US: comfort food for the masses.\n\nOn a recent return to Hong Kong, my birthplace, I revisited a few of my favourite cha chaan tengs. Some were iconic eateries and old haunts when I was growing up, and others more recent discoveries. All are unique and delicious in their own ways.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to talk about cha chaan tengs without mentioning what is arguably the most famous of them all: Lan Fong Yuen. Situated on one of the steep hillside lanes in Central, it opened in 1952 and is the oldest tea restaurant around today. Due to its history, long queues are to be expected at almost any time of day, and the crowds can be overwhelming.\n\nThe first thing you see is a rather dilapidated shack blocking the entrance, where waiters are busy pouring cans of evaporated and condensed milk into cups of black tea. What sets Hong Kong-style milk tea apart is its unique brewing method: black tea is repeatedly filtered through a stocking-like cloth bag up to eight times, creating an extra-strong brew, optimal for sweetening. As the owner Lam Chun-chung says: \u201cMaking milk tea is a profession.\u201d\n\nI visited on a swelteringly hot April day but could not resist ordering the French toast: a cha chaan teng classic, deep fried and covered with a fat slab of melting butter. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, it\u2019s the epitome of indulgence. I suggest washing it down with yuen yeung, another much-loved Canto-western beverage, which Lan Fong Yuen claims to have invented. This mix of brewed coffee with black tea, milk and sugar is a perfect breakfast pick-me-up.\n\nI grew up in the Tai Hang district, so naturally it holds a very dear place in my heart. Every time I return to the city, I walk along the neighbourhood\u2019s narrow streets, looking for a hearty meal that brings me a feeling of home. I find it at Bing Kee. While the area is experiencing a gentrification-led resurgence, with new construction under way and the arrival of independent caf\u00e9s and wine bars, Bing Kee has withstood the test of time for some 70 years.\n\nHere, food is prepared in a tin shack and brought out to tables that fill the alleyways, lined up against old and sometimes decaying buildings. Diners sit on plastic stools, slurping down Bing Kee\u2019s signature pork ramen and drinking lemon or milk tea (among the best in town). On my visit, I ordered ramen with pork blood, curry squid and red sausage, a distinctly Cantonese delicacy that was a pungent and savoury reminder of home. I paired the noodles with a peanut butter and condensed-milk toast, another cha chaan teng staple and a personal favourite.\n\nNot far from Tai Hang is Causeway Bay, the premier shopping district in Hong Kong. Hidden between colossal malls and towering skyscrapers is Soul Kitchen, a modern-style cha chaan teng that opened just a few years ago. This is as local as it gets \u2014 well liked by Hongkongers in the know. It has become a regular stop for me whenever I am in the city.\n\nSoul Kitchen has won acclaim for its dish of scrambled eggs with XO sauce rice. It\u2019s an ingenious combination of a Chinese way of preparing protein with a western topping. To the rich and creamy scrambled egg the chefs add prawns, an ample dose of sweet soy sauce and a scoop of XO sauce, umami-flavoured chilli paste made from dried shrimps, scallops and peppers. Poured on steamy rice, it\u2019s a delight to behold and a sensation to savour.\n\nAnother highlight is the red bean ice, a dessert drink made of adzuki beans, light rock-sugar syrup and evaporated milk. Cool, sweet and very refreshing, it\u2019s another must-try. But Soul Kitchen is also an excellent place to observe a cross-section of Hong Kong society. Attracting diners from all walks of life, it is where class converges, status dissolves and, for a brief moment, all that is relevant is the food before us that we grew up loving.\n\nWaso Cafe is a popular stop for cha chaan teng enthusiasts in the bustling neighbourhood of Wan Chai, where there is a high concentration of similar venues. Locals descend here for its star offering: pineapple buns. Inspired by Mexican concha, Japan\u2019s melonpan and Portuguese pastries, they are soft on the bottom but crunchy on top, with a thick outer layer of sugar dough. Diners love to slather them with cold butter, which the bread\u2019s warmth slowly melts away. Adding a pork chop or ham is another option.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all about the buns. Waso also does tasty rice and noodle dishes, including pork barbecue with sunny-side-up rice, beef brisket rice with white radish, and beef and pork-liver rice noodles. All of them are great examples of hearty, authentic Hong Kong cuisine.\n\nFrenetic, dynamic and full of life, Waso is a good representation of Hong Kong at its most unvarnished. In a city constantly evolving and adapting, it perhaps most typifies the Hong Kong that I call home.\n\nDo you have a favourite cha chaan teng in Hong Kong? Tell us in the comments below.

Climate change is happening even faster than expected. In determining what happens next, China will play a pivotal role. It is now by far the largest greenhouse gas emitter. But it is far ahead, too, in the race for supremacy in green technology. The International Energy Agency expects a striking 60 per cent of all renewable energy capacity installed worldwide between now and 2030 to come from China. It is the leading manufacturer of wind turbines, solar panels, electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries. It dominates the downstream supply chain, too, with its control of critical minerals.\n\nFor western democracies, Beijing\u2019s green ascendance sparks two big concerns. One is that its price advantage \u2014 achieved with hefty state support \u2014 will drive western rivals out of business and leave governments dependent on a strategic competitor for key technology. The other is that \u201csmart\u201d tech embedded in everything from EVs to turbines could pose security risks. The debate around UK chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 visit to Beijing this weekend, over green energy and broader business links, highlights the dilemmas for Europe and the US.\n\nChina\u2019s green advantage has deep roots. It was an early investor in critical minerals. As the energy transition gained steam, it stepped up green subsidies, tax credits and investments. Its annual clean energy investment rose by 40 per cent in 2023 to $890bn, becoming its main growth driver. Its green tech is being heavily deployed at home. Beijing achieved its target of having 1,200 gigawatts of installed solar and wind capacity \u2014 enough to power hundreds of millions of homes \u2014 six years early. EVs are expected to outsell petrol and diesel cars in China this year, 10 years ahead of its target.\n\nSince China accounts for 30 per cent of global carbon emissions, the rest of the world clearly needs it to be ploughing ahead. But with global 2050 emission targets looking shaky \u2014 and the impact of warming becoming more evident, most recently in the devastating fires in Los Angeles \u2014 the rest of the world has little choice but to take advantage of low-cost Chinese wind and solar technologies. Limited access to critical minerals and a high cost of capital mean advanced economies cannot now meet their green goals without Beijing.\n\nGiven the risks of over-dependency, it makes sense for the US and Europe to continue developing and diversifying their own green supply chains. But trying to usurp China from behind protectionist walls is expensive and at odds with the urgency of climate change.\n\nChina has a surplus of green tech, so urging Beijing to share more intellectual property in exchange for market access is one approach. Rather than blocking Beijing\u2019s green imports outright, national security concerns could be addressed by more robust tech inspections, ensuring local control over plants using Chinese products, and assessing whether vulnerable \u201csmart\u201d components can be isolated or removed.\n\nRemaining open to Chinese low-cost green tech would allow countries to allocate more resources to areas where they still have comparative advantages. America leads in carbon capture and storage, and has unrivalled climate financing infrastructure. The EU is competitive in high-end climate research and development; in 2020, it issued more patents for green tech than the US or China. Britain is ahead in offshore wind, and Brazil is an expert in biofuels. Trade in these will also expedite the global transition.\n\nChina may be the leader in green tech, but the more important race is the one the planet is running, against the clock, to curb climate change. If it is to win it, countries will need to find strategies to work with Beijing in green tech, while minimising the risks.", "tag": "china?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d3650b44-0313-44c9-a7aa-495549b158b5"}, {"uuid4": "d8e7dfa5-62b0-431b-b056-881467b5dd12", "title": "Logistics groups move Chinese staff to help companies tackle Sino-US trade tensions", "description": "DHL, Ceva Logistics and Kuehne+Nagel are redeploying Mandarin speakers to help China\u2019s manufacturers set up overseas", "author": "Gloria Li", "published_date": "2025-01-12T05:00:42.535Z", "content": "Global logistics groups are rushing to relocate Chinese staff as more manufacturers in the country prepare to expand overseas in anticipation of tougher trading conditions with the US under a second Donald Trump presidency.\n\nFrance\u2019s CMA CGM, Switzerland\u2019s Kuehne+Nagel and Germany\u2019s DHL said they were redeploying Chinese staff to Europe, south-east Asia and Latin America, destinations that have been chosen for a \u201cChina-plus-one\u201d diversification strategy, in order to better serve Chinese customers abroad.\n\nThe groups, who help clients manage their imports and exports, are responding to manufacturers\u2019 moves to other low-cost production hubs as western buyers and politicians seek to cut imports from China amid rising trade tensions with the US.\n\nCEVA, the logistics arm of CMA CGM, said it recently set up \u201cChina desks\u201d in Europe with Mandarin-speaking staff, including sales and customer service specialists.

The region accounted for about three-quarters of global solar photovoltaic installations, with Germany leading by a wide margin.\u00a0Then China decided to break into the market. Its plan worked, perhaps too well.\n\nWhile the People\u2019s Republic managed to snatch market share from Germany, the cost has been a plague of overcapacity and falling prices. Investors have avoided the sector for its unappealing outlook and bleak growth prospects. But there are now signs that the sector may be approaching a bottom.\n\nIt is hard to overstate the extent of slack in the solar industry. China\u2019s solar cell production capacity reached about 1,000 gigawatts last year \u2014 not only exceeding current global demand but enough, at the rate of last year\u2019s growth, to exceed total projected demand through to 2035.\n\nAs a result, in the decade through to 2020, the cost of solar panels fell about 85 per cent. Earnings have deteriorated: about a third of China\u2019s listed solar companies reported a loss last year and several went bankrupt.\n\nPotential policy shifts in important markets outside China, notably the US, add to the uncertainty. Subsidies offered under President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act could come up for debate under president-elect Donald Trump.\n\nBut there are some signs of recovery. Prices of polysilicon, a vital material for solar cells, rose 2.2 per cent this week compared with the previous week to its highest level since last May, continuing a trend that started in December. Production cuts and declining inventories are starting to yield results. The rapid growth of renewables in important markets such as south-east Asia and India could start to redefine the sector.\n\nChina can help itself, somewhat. As the world\u2019s largest consumer of solar panels, it has been ramping up installation plans through new large-scale projects in the region. This includes China\u2019s \u201cSolar Great Wall\u201d in Inner Mongolia, which is set to transform deserts into renewable energy hubs at an unprecedented scale, adding demand for solar panels. An over-dependence on government-driven demand is no real solution, but eases some pressure as the industry works through its glut of solar panels.\n\nInvestors adjusted to the gloom long ago. Shares of JA Solar Technology and JinkoSolar Holding, two large manufacturers, have sagged by about two-thirds since their 2022 peak. But they are up more than a fifth over the past six months. With the sector seemingly nearing a bottom, it might finally be time to lighten up.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com", "tag": "china?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/16781614-cc27-44e5-901a-7544f8f6358c"}, {"uuid4": "82b9e6be-d2f1-4902-b141-bb94f375f0ce", "title": "Chinese toymaker taps \u2018kidult\u2019 craze as shares soar on Hong Kong debut", "description": "As birth rates fall in Asia, companies focus on nostalgic toys for young adults", "author": "Thomas Hale", "published_date": "2025-01-10T11:04:21.680Z", "content": "Shares in Bloks Group, a maker of Transformers and other toy figurines, as much as doubled on their Hong Kong debut on Friday, making a billionaire of their founder and underlining the surge in \u2018kidult\u2019 culture despite falling birth rates in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nShares in the Chinese toymaker rose as much as 82 per cent on their secondary listing debut in Hong Kong, before closing up 41 per cent, valuing founder Weisong Zhu\u2019s stake at more than US$1bn.

And I think that trend is likely to continue,\u201d said Hui Shan, chief China economist at Goldman Sachs.\n\nFalling yields offer a stark contrast to volatile and rising yields in Europe and the US. For Beijing, the fall represents an ignominious start to the year after policymakers in September launched a stimulus drive designed to revive the Chinese economy\u2019s animal spirits.\n\nBut data released on Thursday showed consumer prices remained close to flat in December, eking out growth of just 0.1 per cent on a year earlier, while factory prices declined 2.3 per cent, remaining in deflationary territory for more than two years.\n\nChina\u2019s central bank last year unveiled policies to stimulate investment by institutions in equity markets and announced for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis that it was adopting a \u201cmoderately loose\u201d monetary policy.\n\nOn Friday, it announced a \u201cshortage of supply\u201d meant it would pause its programme that has seen it purchase a net Rmb1tn of government bonds on the open market.\n\nAn important Communist party meeting on the economy in December, presided over by President Xi Jinping, emphasised consumption for the first time over other previously more important strategic priorities such as building high-tech industries.\n\nThe change of emphasis reflects concern over household sentiment weakened by a three-year property crisis that has left the economy more dependent on a manufacturing and export boom for growth.\u00a0Investors worry this run of strong exports will slow abruptly after US president-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20 with promises to levy up to 60 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nCiti economists estimated in a research note that a 15 percentage point increase in US tariffs would reduce China\u2019s exports by 6 per cent, knocking a percentage point off GDP growth. Growth in China was estimated to be 5 per cent last year.\n\nMore insidious than the slower growth, however, are the deflationary pressures in China\u2019s economy, said analysts. The Citi economists noted that the final quarter of last year was expected to be the seventh in a row in which the GDP deflator, a broad measure of price changes, was negative.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented for China, with a similar episode only in 1998-99,\u201d they said, pointing out that only Japan, parts of Europe and some commodity producers had experienced such an extended period of deflation.\n\nChinese regulators are aware of the parallels with Japan on deflation, said Robert Gilhooly, senior emerging markets economist at Abrdn, but \u201cthey don\u2019t seem to act like it, and one thing that contributed to the Japan example was going small with piecemeal easing\u201d.\n\nGoldman\u2019s Shan said the central bank had promised to ease monetary policy this year, but just as important would be a large increase in China\u2019s fiscal deficit at the central and local government levels.\n\nHow that deficit is spent will also be important. Channelling it directly to low-income households, for example, might have a higher \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d than giving it to other sectors, such as to banks for recapitalisation, she said.\n\nFrederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, said another reason government bond yields were at record lows was that the economy was awash with liquidity. High household savings and low demand for corporate and individual loans have left banks flush with cash that is finding its way into bond markets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a liquidity trap in the sense that there is money, it is available, it can be borrowed cheaply, but there\u2019s just no demand for that,\u201d said Neumann. \u201cMonetary easing at the margin is becoming less and less of an effective driver of economic growth.\u201d\n\nWithout a strong fiscal spending package, the deflationary cycle might continue, with interest rates dropping, wages and investment falling and consumers deferring purchases while they wait for prices to fall further.\n\n\u201cSome investors have lost a little bit of patience here in the past week,\u201d he said, referring to the rush into bonds. \u201cIt\u2019s still likely we\u2019re going to get more stimulus coming through. But after all the fits and starts of the past couple of years, investors really want to see concrete numbers.\u201d\n\nSome economists warned that the slide in Chinese bond yields could have further to fall. Analysts at Standard Chartered said the 10-year yield could fall another 0.2 percentage points to 1.4 per cent by the end of 2025, especially if the market has to absorb higher net central government bond issuance for stimulus purposes.", "tag": "china?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6fe07039-eb7d-47d9-8e97-e933bab0085a"}, {"uuid4": "72a05ff9-e544-4fd7-a0a2-fc21d1ad011a", "title": "Xi Jinping to send top-level China envoy to Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration", "description": "Unusual diplomatic overture comes as Beijing braces for escalating tensions with new administration ", "author": "Demetri Sevastopulo", "published_date": "2025-01-09T22:41:10.950Z", "content": "China\u2019s President Xi Jinping will send a high-level envoy to Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, in an unprecedented move designed to reduce friction between the countries at the start of the new US administration.\n\nBeijing told Trump\u2019s transition team that the top official would attend instead of Xi, according to several people familiar with the talks.

Officials said a 2024 budget of Rmb150bn, funded through special government bonds, was used up by the end of the year.\n\nThe commerce ministry said 36mn consumers used the scheme last year to buy Rmb240bn worth of home appliances, and that it drove Rmb920bn of car sales.\n\nIn addition to home appliances and automobiles, the programme also aimed to incentivise companies to upgrade industrial equipment and agricultural machinery.\n\nLast month, the National Bureau of Statistics said November retail sales were boosted by the programme, citing a 22 per cent year-on-year rise in sales of household appliances and audiovisual products such as televisions. Sales of building and decoration materials, also covered by the scheme, turned positive for the first time since April.\n\nBut overall retail sales rose just 3 per cent in November, missing expectations and reigniting concerns about the pace of consumption growth, while real estate data showed the largest year-on-year fall in new home prices since 2015 and a deepening decline in property investment.\n\nChina last September launched measures to support equities and the housing market, where sales have struggled to gain traction against the backdrop of a yearlong property slowdown.

The initial public offering would give it access to offshore funds as it seeks to expand overseas, and\u00a0Morgan Stanley has estimated it could raise up to $7.7bn.\n\nGoldman Sachs, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have all expressed interest in working on the listing, according to two people with knowledge of the process. The Shenzhen-listed company is expected to pick the underwriters ahead of a shareholder meeting on January 17, one of the people said, where the date and size of the offering are due to be discussed.\n\nBut the move by the Pentagon \u2014 which also added tech giant Tencent and Cosco, one of China\u2019s largest shipping companies, to the list \u2014 threatens to change the banks\u2019 risk-reward calculus.\n\nAlthough it does not directly introduce legal restrictions on the banks\u2019 ability to work for the companies listed, it will force them to confront a difficult reputational question: can a bank underwrite shares for a company the US has said is linked to China\u2019s military?\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, client names randomly appearing on blacklists is becoming a more common feature of banking these days, and that adds risk,\u201d said Han Shen Lin, China country director for US consultancy The Asia Group. \u201cThe most banks can do is reposition their business and client mix accordingly.\u201d\n\nInclusion on the list \u201cdoesn\u2019t carry the same weight as a sanction, but it\u2019s close enough that banks [may] preemptively cut exposure to the names just to avoid negative headlines,\u201d Lin said.\n\nIt is not clear whether the US banks will continue their involvement in the wake of the Pentagon\u2019s move. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and JPMorgan declined to comment, and Morgan Stanley did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe action is the latest sign of how US-China tensions are increasingly throwing deals into uncertainty \u2014 a marked change from previous years when global banks made huge profits in Hong Kong by helping fast-growing Chinese companies list overseas, many in the US.\n\nAny move to cut ties with companies on the list could be costly for the banks. Tencent in particular has been among US institutions\u2019 most important Chinese clients.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s parent company paid $524mn in investment banking fees between 2004, the year of its initial public offering, and 2023, according to figures from the London Stock Exchange Group. Morgan Stanley, BofA, Goldman and Citi were the top beneficiaries.\n\nCATL has made less use of foreign banks, with the lion\u2019s share of its fees going to China Securities and CICC, although Goldman is the third-largest fee earner from its investment banking activities, according to the LSEG data.\n\nCATL and Tencent have said they are planning legal action to challenge being placed on the Pentagon list if talks with the US defence department fail.\n\nPony Ma, Tencent founder and chair, said the company was \u201cneither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defence industrial base\u201d. CATL said it had \u201cnever engaged in any military-related business or activities\u201d, and Cosco said none of the companies listed were \u201cChinese military companies\u201d and that it would engage with US authorities \u201cto clarify this matter\u201d.\n\nThe move echoes the banks\u2019 dilemma in 2023 when Syngenta, a Swiss agricultural chemicals company, sought to hire them for a planned $9bn initial public offering on the Shanghai exchange.\n\nBanks agonised over whether they could work on the deal because the US defence department had placed Syngenta\u2019s owner, state-owned ChemChina, on a \u201cChinese military companies\u201d list.\n\nBankers at Goldman, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, UBS and HSBC had lobbied for roles on the listing, though Syngenta eventually called off the plan.\n\nCATL has told investors that access to dollars is an important part of the rationale for its listing. It had Rmb289bn ($40bn) of cash as of March 31, but China\u2019s strict system of capital controls means it must get government approval for overseas direct investment above a certain threshold, which can be an arduous process.\n\nPointing to CATL\u2019s use by global carmakers might help bankers justify working on the deal, especially if they add a \u201cmajor disclaimer\u201d to documents about the listing, according to one adviser not directly involved.\n\n\u201cI mean, their batteries are in the Ford Mustang,\u201d said the adviser.", "tag": "china?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3ed51022-9d22-407a-a965-27a6d3b25582"}, {"uuid4": "e6c9b8d6-713f-4047-8177-444616436840", "title": "House of Huawei \u2014 inside China\u2019s \u2018most powerful company\u2019", "description": "Eva Dou\u2019s authoritative account of the secretive tech company that has become a flashpoint in US-China relations", "author": "Eleanor Olcott", "published_date": "2025-01-08T05:00:46.193Z", "content": "It is nearly impossible to go a day in China without touching some part of Huawei\u2019s empire. The Chinese technology giant sells a variety of consumer electronics, from TVs and smart home systems to smartphones. Its telecommunications networks and data centres keep the population online; its autonomous driving solutions are embedded in a growing number of electric cars. It designs semiconductors, builds solar panels and even has hotels. And it also operates surveillance systems for local governments, while harnessing its vast purchasing and distribution power to pressure suppliers and competitors.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to call it \u201cChina\u2019s most powerful company,\u201d as Eva Dou does in her new book, House of Huawei. The Washington Post journalist and former China correspondent has written an authoritative account of a company that has become both a byword for China\u2019s rising technological supremacy and a flashpoint in US-China relations.\n\nHuawei is a hugely ambitious company. Since its founding in 1987 in Shenzhen it has come to dominate global telecommunication networks through strategic technology bets. Along the way it has attracted increasing scrutiny from governments outside China who fear that Huawei\u2019s network equipment enables Beijing\u2019s spying.\n\nYet, little is known about the inner workings of this mysterious company. It was thrust into the global spotlight in 2018 following the arrest of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada. The US sought to extradite Meng, also the daughter of Huawei\u2019s enigmatic founder Ren Zhengfei, over her role in the company\u2019s business in sanctioned Iran. The book narrates the drama in detail and explains why Huawei found itself at the centre of so much controversy.\n\nIt is a tale that sits at the heart of the most significant geopolitical relationship today and takes the reader a long way in understanding why Washington and Beijing are at loggerheads over the fate of a company that has done so much to bolster China\u2019s technological ecosystem and extend its influence overseas. Washington pressured allies to stop using Huawei\u2019s 5G equipment, which the UK initially resisted before relenting, ordering the equipment to be stripped from public networks.\n\nDonald Trump first imposed sanctions on Huawei in 2019 during his first presidency, restricting some US companies from doing business with it over national security concerns. The action turned Huawei into a martyr in China. The assault from Washington continued under President Joe Biden, who further tightened restrictions on the company. Beijing has gone to great lengths to support Huawei through its turmoil after it was cut off from critical foreign technology that it used in products. The government lavished it with subsidies, pressured customers to buy its products over imported alternatives, and spared it from any action during a tech crackdown that tamed the power of China\u2019s other tech giants, Tencent and Alibaba.\n\nNow, Marco Rubio, Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of state in the incoming US administration, points to another turbulent four years for Huawei. Rubio recently penned an op-ed for the Miami Herald saying Huawei\u2019s goal is \u201cglobal domination\u201d, calling it \u201cless a telecom company than it is a geopolitical asset of the Chinese Communist party\u201d. Huawei insists that it is a private company and that the government does not interfere with its business or the security of its products.\n\nMeng\u2019s arrest forced Huawei to open up to the outside world. The media-shy Ren gave interviews to foreign media as part of a charm offensive to aid his daughter\u2019s case. Dou chronicles Ren\u2019s life \u2014 from his childhood growing up in poverty in Guizhou, a mountainous province in south-west China, to running the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker \u2014 in a way that helps the reader understand what motivates this notoriously ruthless engineer.\n\nHuawei\u2019s first business was importing telephone switches before building its own, cheaper versions, copying foreign designs in the process. It later benefited from a government policy to rip out foreign technology in China\u2019s communications network. Huawei developed a reputation for generosity towards government officials and telecoms executives, paying for international travel and hosting lavish banquets at its campus. Dou portrays Ren as an expert networker, including sending birthday cakes to retired telecoms experts who had helped Huawei.\n\nThere are many unanswered questions about Huawei that are the root of its troubles with the US. What is its relationship with the Chinese Communist party? Does its technology facilitate Beijing\u2019s spying overseas? What is Ren\u2019s relationship with the People\u2019s Liberation Army, where he used to be an engineer? Did Huawei\u2019s early technological innovations in router technology come, as its critics say, off the back of rampant intellectual property theft from western rivals that it then went on to annihilate?\n\nDou does not give a definitive answer to these questions but eloquently lays out the available facts and allows readers to draw their own conclusions. She is also transparent about reporting limits in understanding this purposefully opaque company. The reader is left with the impression that political support has been instrumental to Huawei\u2019s rise and that Beijing has a strong vested interest to see it succeed.\n\nHouse of Huawei is at its best when describing how the company won the fight to dominate global network communication systems. Chinese tech companies are renowned for their brutally long hours and dedicated work culture. But none so much as the \u201cwolf warrior\u201d Huawei, which dispatched workers through the Sars pandemic in 2003 to win contracts over foreign companies that pulled back their workforce during the health crisis, and defied official warnings to exit countries in turmoil during the Arab Spring, sending engineers to fix equipment broken by protesters.\n\nHuawei reflects the rise of many other Chinese companies that have ventured into sectors dominated by the west. Initially, rivals dismissed the company, saying it could not innovate. That proved to be a fatal error, as Huawei came to dominate the rollout of 5G technology and has set its eyes on ever more ambitious projects.\n\nWhile the book provides a neat account of Huawei\u2019s growing dominance in network communications, it does not cover its newer businesses that it sees as the company\u2019s future, including data centres, generative AI and autonomous driving. But it does give the reader a balanced and detailed account of a company that has weathered multiple existential crises and emerged more powerful than ever.\n\nFollowing Meng\u2019s return to China in late 2021, the brief period of openness ended. It stopped courting foreign journalists and providing detailed financial breakdowns in annual reports. It did not co-operate with Dou on the book. As Huawei retreats from the limelight and reporting on this company has grown more difficult, a book describing its origins and place in Chinese corporate history is more needed than ever.\n\nHouse of Huawei: Inside the Secret World of China\u2019s Most Powerful Company by Eva Dou Abacus \u00a325/Portfolio $34, 448 pages\n\nEleanor Olcott is the FT\u2019s\u2009China Technology Correspondent in Beijing\n\nJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Caf\u00e9 and follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X", "tag": "china?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/12ab5104-2407-42ef-a9f3-f3a67d270d65"}, {"uuid4": "1ba66c2e-3757-431b-a02c-7ac3eef3b3bf", "title": "Chinese airlines rush into Europe as western carriers retreat", "description": "Ability to keep flying over Russia helps three big state-owned carriers undercut European rivals", "author": "Philip Georgiadis", "published_date": "2025-01-08T05:00:46.035Z", "content": "China\u2019s three biggest state-owned airlines are rapidly expanding routes and capacity to Europe as their ability to fly over Russian airspace gives them a cost advantage over regional rivals.\n\nWestern carriers have slashed direct flights to China, with Scandinavian Airlines, Lufthansa, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic all suspending some routes to the mainland in 2024, citing cost pressures from avoiding Russia.\n\nMoscow banned most European airlines from Russian airspace in 2022 in response to western sanctions imposed in the wake of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, adding hours to flights to Asian destinations, including China, and driving up fuel bills.\n\nChinese airlines, which are unaffected by the Russian airspace ban, have rushed to fill the gap, increasing capacity and offering cheaper tickets despite persistently reporting losses.\n\n\u201cEuropean carriers are just not competitive,\u201d said David Yu, an aviation industry expert at New York University Shanghai.\n\nPassenger seat capacity, measured in available seat kilometres, between China and western Europe by the three main Chinese intercontinental carriers \u2014 Air China, China Eastern and China Southern \u2014 was 18 per cent higher in October than in the same month in 2019, according to DBS equity research analyst Jason Sum.\n\nThe three airlines\u2019 scheduled flights to the UK, Spain and Italy have risen sharply, according to aviation consultancy Ishka, up between 25 per cent and 45 per cent in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 2019.\n\nThey are also able to offer more competitive prices given the cost advantage of flying over Russia. The big three airlines\u2019 fares are roughly 5 per cent to 35 per cent cheaper than those of European airlines for direct round-trip flights between China and western Europe, according to UBS analyst Eric Lin.\n\nEuropean airlines have complained that Chinese carriers have an unfair advantage and are establishing a stranglehold on routes between the two regions.\n\nUS airlines have successfully lobbied the US government to keep a tight cap on the number of direct round-trip flights to China to stop further inroads from the big Chinese carriers.\n\nIn a statement, Lufthansa said European airlines were \u201cin\u00a0an extremely unequal competitive position with China\u201d, where it said carriers benefited from lower costs and greater government support, as well as the ability to overfly\u00a0Russia.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Lufthansa now must remove one of its oldest routes, Frankfurt-Beijing, from its flight schedule shows how much the balance of international competition is shifting,\u201d the airline said.\n\nWestern industry executives privately question the level of demand for the Chinese airlines\u2019 flights, which some say could be lossmaking. Analysts say political motivation is also at work as Beijing expands its visa-free plans to bring back tourists.\n\n\u201cThe economy is coming down in China, tourism is not [fully] back yet and business is still recovering,\u201d said one China-based aviation industry executive. \u201cYou need to increase connectivity in order to increase the flow of people to China.\u201d\n\nBut while some western carriers have pointed to weak demand for flights out of China, UBS said international passenger demand for the big Chinese airlines was close to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nLarge Chinese carriers have also boosted direct flights to the Middle East in recent months amid an expansion in business activity between Asia\u2019s biggest economy and the Gulf region as well as a deepening of economic ties, particularly between China and Saudi Arabia.\n\nScheduled flights in the first nine months of 2024 for the big three airlines to Saudi Arabia jumped more than seven-fold compared with the same period in 2019, according to Ishka, while flights to the United Arab Emirates rose 40 per cent.\n\nThe big three carriers are important to the government in Beijing given aviation was \u201cseen as a critical engine towards ongoing economic growth\u201d, said Ishka\u2019s analysts, adding that the carriers were helped by route subsidies and that state ownership meant they had significant credit facilities available.\n\nBeijing-based Air China, Shanghai\u2019s China Eastern and Guangzhou\u2019s China Southern came into existence in the 1980s when the state airline monopoly was broken up and the industry underwent consolidation. All three are dual listed in Hong Kong and in mainland China.\n\nWhile the Chinese airlines are taking advantage of their cost advantage over European rivals, the country\u2019s mixed economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic means they are still losing money overall.\n\nIn stark contrast to the booming profits reported in 2023 by flagship carriers in Europe and in other Asian nations, China\u2019s three big airlines recorded combined losses of Rmb13.3bn ($1.8bn). HSBC and DBS believe Air China and China Eastern could report losses again in 2024.\n\nAnalysts said the top Chinese carriers had taken a particular hit from slowing consumption in China as well as growing competition from low-cost carriers on domestic routes. Fares in 2024 for flights departing from Chinese airports are down more than 20 per cent from 2023 for domestic and international flights, according to aviation data provider ForwardKeys.\n\nThe big Chinese airlines\u2019 outlook for 2025 \u201ccontinues to be dim\u201d, according to Sum at DBS, who said domestic competition would continue to exert \u201cstrong pressure\u201d on profits per passenger while China\u2019s economic slowdown was likely to weigh on premium travel demand.\n\nA subdued recovery in flights to the airlines\u2019 crucial market of North America will also add to profitability pressures, according to Lin at UBS. While Canada in October lifted restrictions on flights to China, flights in early November between China and the US only reached about 30 per cent of 2019 levels, compared with more than 90 per cent for China-Europe flights, according to UBS.\n\nAdditional reporting by Haohsiang Ko in Hong Kong", "tag": "china?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a3eeb268-5daa-4525-858b-eab93b28d3c7"}, {"uuid4": "15fd5de2-cd19-4278-b043-327d8d222d83", "title": "China\u2019s biggest football club kicked out of league as financial woes mount", "description": "Guangzhou FC\u2019s struggles relate to collapse of property developer China Evergrande", "author": "Gloria Li", "published_date": "2025-01-07T11:39:18.835Z", "content": "Guangzhou FC, once China\u2019s leading professional football club and a symbol of the country\u2019s aspirations in the sport, has been dropped from the national league after a drawn-out saga related to the collapse of property developer China Evergrande, which bought the team in 2010.\n\nThe club \u2014 which won eight national league titles from 2011-2019, topped Asia\u2019s Champions League twice and drew in names such as Brazil\u2019s Robinho and Italian coach Marcello Lippi \u2014 failed to meet financial entry requirements.\n\nIn a statement that referred to Guangzhou and two other ineligible clubs \u2014 the Cangzhou Mighty Lions and the Hunan Billows \u2014 the Chinese Football Association cited wage arrears and debt issues.\n\nGuangzhou\u2019s ineligibility is the latest blow to Chinese football, which President Xi Jinping sought to develop when he came to power in 2012. In recent years, the sport has grappled with corruption scandals and financial issues at the companies backing the teams.\n\nGuangzhou FC, formerly named Guangzhou Evergrande, on Monday blamed its \u201chistorical debt burden\u201d and the \u201cinsufficient funds\u201d to address it. \u201cTo all those who cared about and supported the club, we express our sincere apologies,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nAfter its purchase by property developer Evergrande in 2010, the club embarked on a spending spree that included a host of big-name signings, echoing the boom years of China\u2019s vast and heavily indebted real estate sector. A host of other top developers also owned teams named after them.\n\nBut the failure of its majority owner in late 2021 derailed the club\u2019s plans for a new Rmb12bn ($1.6bn) stadium in southern China\u2019s Guangzhou, mooted to be one of the largest in the world, and relegated the club to the Chinese league\u2019s second tier.\n\nIn early 2021, the club removed Evergrande from its name under a new rule prohibiting company names to be used in football teams. In its most recent annual report, for the year 2022, Evergrande did not mention the club except to state it had returned land use rights for the stadium to Guangzhou authorities.\n\nEvergrande, with more than $300bn of liabilities as of 2022, frantically sought to dispose of non-core assets following its default on international debts in late 2021. Chinese authorities have focused on getting the company to complete unfinished housing projects.\n\nThe football club was a big focus for Evergrande founder Hui Ka Yan, formerly China\u2019s richest man, who is under investigation in the wake of his company\u2019s collapse.\n\nEvergrande invested Rmb1.9bn to build Evergrande Football School, one of the world\u2019s biggest residential football academies, with the help of coaches from Real Madrid in 2012, state media reported at the time.\n\nGuangzhou FC\u2019s struggles follow the dissolution of Jiangsu FC in 2021 by its owner Suning Appliance Group, also owing to financial issues. Suning, which until last May controlled Inter Milan, was hit by an investment in an Evergrande subsidiary that failed to list.\n\nCorruption issues also plague the country\u2019s football league. Last September, the Chinese Football Association banned 43 people for life after an investigation uncovered match-fixing.\n\nAdditional reporting by Wang Xueqiao in Shanghai", "tag": "china?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0e686641-8ab5-46ae-9195-d9b93baa2bcd"}, {"uuid4": "36222ded-7e4e-4e95-93ed-9d0cd8f83803", "title": "Why China\u2019s industrial giants won\u2019t be damaged by latest US blacklisting ", "description": "Being placed on the Chinese military blacklist does not carry specific penalties or immediate bans", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-01-07T11:34:42.251Z", "content": "The inclusion of Chinese companies on US blacklists is hardly new. But in recent years, the growing dominance of Chinese firms in sectors such as electric vehicle batteries and shipbuilding has attracted both significant foreign investment and attention that makes them particularly susceptible to US regulatory actions.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US Defense Department added CATL, the world\u2019s largest EV battery maker, and Tencent, the largest game maker, to a blacklist for alleged links to the Chinese military. Shares in both dropped in response \u2014 in the case of Tencent more than 7 per cent in Hong Kong, highlighting investors\u2019 sensitivity to rising geopolitical tensions and regulatory risks. But the sell-off should be shortlived.\n\nOther companies on the Chinese military blacklist include chipmaker Changxin Memory Technologies and China\u2019s largest shipping company Cosco Shipping Holdings, plus two local shipbuilders. Tencent and CATL have denied military ties and called the designation a mistake.\n\nInvestors\u2019 concerns about the potential impact of the latest blacklisting are understandable given the global market share and investor base of the affected companies. Chinese shipbuilders, for example, accounted for nearly three-quarters of all global new orders last year.\n\nBut not all blacklists are equal. There are certain types of blacklists that can cause much financial damage to affected companies. For example, the entity list maintained by the Department of Commerce \u2014 which restricts US exports of goods and technology to listed entities without a licence \u2014 is one. An investment ban on certain Chinese companies is another, as this gives US investors a deadline to divest, resulting in a lasting sell-off.\n\nBut being placed on the Chinese military blacklist is a designation that carries no specific penalties and does not involve immediate bans for companies. For Tencent, which gets most of its revenue outside of the US, the financial impact should be limited. While CATL supplies US companies including Tesla, analysts estimate that US revenue constitutes less than a tenth of the group total for both companies.\n\nThere is also a precedent for challenging such designations. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi successfully contested its inclusion on the US Department of Defense\u2019s military blacklist in 2021 through a lawsuit. Within months it reached an agreement with the US government to be removed. Shares of Xiaomi rose about 30 per cent in the months following.\n\nTuesday\u2019s market reaction serves as a reminder of the inherent risks posed by escalating geopolitical rivalry between China and the US. But the material impact on the affected companies should be minimal.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com", "tag": "china?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4af930bd-11f2-489f-b82e-ea785ff6e175"}, {"uuid4": "1612e935-6bc4-422f-a915-c33bd2a29b36", "title": "Tencent and CATL consider legal action over inclusion on Pentagon blacklist ", "description": "Tech giant and biggest EV battery maker say designation as Chinese military companies is a \u2018mistake\u2019", "author": "Eleanor Olcott", "published_date": "2025-01-07T11:21:18.820Z", "content": "Tencent and CATL are planning legal action to challenge being placed on a Pentagon list as \u201cChinese military companies\u201d, if talks with the US defence department fail to get their new designations dropped.\n\nThe social media and gaming giant and the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle battery maker both announced on Tuesday they would contest their inclusion on an annually updated list of companies determined to have links with China\u2019s military machine.\n\nPony Ma, Tencent founder and chair, said in a statement that the company would \u201cengage in discussions with the US Department of Defense\u201d to be removed from Monday\u2019s list, adding that \u201cif necessary, [Tencent] will undertake legal proceedings\u201d.\n\nHe said Tencent was \u201cneither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defence industrial base\u201d.\n\nCATL said in a statement it had \u201cnever engaged in any military-related business or activities\u201d, the move was a \u201cmistake\u201d and was \u201cexpected to have no substantially adverse impact on our business\u201d.\n\nIt also said it would \u201cproactively engage\u201d with the defence department \u201cto address the false designation, including legal action if necessary, to protect the interests of our company and shareholders as a whole\u201d.\n\nAnalysts said there was a strong precedent for Chinese consumer tech companies being removed from the list if they could prove wrongful designation.\n\nIn 2021, consumer electronics group Xiaomi successfully removed itself from the Pentagon list when a federal court determined there was insufficient evidence for the designation.\n\n\u201cWe believe [Tencent] has a good chance to secure exclusion through US courts,\u201d wrote Ivan Su, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, in a note to clients.

As prep, the next occupant of the White House could do worse than read two incisive new books on the man who wants to make China great again.\n\nDuring his election campaign, Trump \u2014 who is set to be inaugurated on January 20 \u2014 had a fair amount to say about Xi. He boasted that Xi respects him because \u201cI\u2019m fucking crazy\u201d. After he was shot at an election rally in July, he said that Xi \u201cwrote me a beautiful note\u201d. On a separate occasion, he called Xi \u201cfierce\u201d and \u201cvery smart\u201d.\n\nThere is, however, a lot more to be learned about Xi, the only world leader whose power could be said to rival that of the US president. The impression that emerges from these two deeply researched books is of a surprisingly complex, multi-layered personality. Xi is a strongman who nevertheless suffered deep childhood trauma. He is a pragmatist who yet retains respect for ideology. Both he and his father were cruelly persecuted by communist authorities but he remains a party loyalist.\n\nThe early part of The Red Emperor by Michael Sheridan has even a reader unschooled in psychoanalysis wondering about the sort of life-long imprint that trauma can inflict. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), a teenage Xi went through more than a dozen \u201cstruggle sessions\u201d, which were violent public humiliations of people held to be \u201cclass enemies\u201d. At some points he was also incarcerated, hungry and infested with fleas.\n\n\u201cOne night a desperate Xi [escaped],\u201d Sheridan writes. \u201cHe ran through the rainswept alleys of Beijing to his home. He banged on the door, hoping to get food and dry clothes. But his mother was so terrified for her own safety \u2014 and that of Jinping\u2019s siblings \u2014 that she not only turned him away but reported his flight to the authorities.\u201d\n\nHis mother did not act out of callousness, Sheridan explains. \u201cThese were the actions of an insider. Knowing that her house was watched, she also knew that punishment for helping her son would be certain. He fled into the rain, crying.\u201d\n\nThis episode is one of several ordeals recounted in Sheridan\u2019s excellent work, the most vivid and compelling biography of Xi published to date. A veteran journalist with extensive experience in Hong Kong and China, Sheridan acknowledges his debt to Howard Zhang, a former head of the BBC News Chinese Service, who acted as lead researcher on Chinese sources for the book.\n\nWhile Sheridan\u2019s book recounts the seminal chapters in Xi\u2019s life and career, Kevin Rudd traces the transformation in China\u2019s ideological worldview since he came to power in 2012. These shifts have turned much of Chinese politics, economics and foreign policy on its head, says Rudd in On Xi Jinping.\n\nIn a nutshell, Xi\u2019s ideological beliefs could be described as \u201cMarxist Nationalism\u201d, argues Rudd, a former Australian prime minister, the current Australian ambassador to the US and a long-standing China expert.\n\nIn detail this means three big things. Xi has taken Chinese politics to the \u201cLeninist left\u201d by stressing centralisation in decision making. He has taken economics to the \u201cMarxist left\u201d, emphasising the role of state-owned enterprises and regulation. Lastly, foreign policy under Xi has moved to the \u201cnationalist right\u201d, making Beijing more confrontational and assertive.\n\nBut what experiences have moulded Xi\u2019s cast of mind? Sheridan devotes attention to his father, Xi Zhongxun. The elder Xi had been an associate of Chairman Mao Zedong and rose to the rank of vice-premier before he was purged in 1962. He was jailed, forced to perform self-criticism and assigned work in a tractor factory. All told, he spent 16 years in the political wilderness.\n\nFollowing his father\u2019s ostracism, Xi found himself banished to an impoverished village in the countryside for seven years of hard labour alongside peasant farmers.\n\nThis meant that by the time he reached the age of 21, Xi had known great privilege as the \u201cprinceling\u201d son of a senior official. He had also tasted public humiliation, persecution and years of poverty in rural exile, estranged from parental love. When his father finally won political rehabilitation in 1978, Xi was re-embraced by the party that had shunned him.\n\nSheridan wisely avoids the diagnoses of cod psychology. But the rest of The Red Emperor leaves no doubt that Xi is a leader obsessed by both the capricious nature of power and the insurance it affords those who control it.\n\nThe most dramatic chapter concerns Xi\u2019s purge in 2014 of Zhou Yongkang, the highest ranking official to be brought down by a corruption case since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic in 1949. As the man in charge of China\u2019s sprawling security agency, Zhou was a member of the politburo, the pinnacle of Chinese power.\n\nAfter his downfall, an official newspaper described Zhou, at the age of 71, as a \u201ccrazy erotomaniac\u201d with a string of mistresses who once had sex in an underground parking lot with an \u201cexceptionally beautiful\u201d TV presenter. But such prurience deflected from more systemic questions: how could the Chinese Communist party harbour a man at its highest echelon who was so grotesquely corrupt?\n\nWhen Zhou was sentenced to life in prison, details of his affairs emerged. Assets worth more than $10bn were seized from his estate, including 300 apartments and houses, 60 cars, hoards of gold, vintage alcohol, silver, jewellery, antiques, paintings and wads of cash in foreign currency.\u00a0Zhou\u2019s case stunned China and showed that Xi was not a leader to be underestimated.\n\nRudd\u2019s book adds a wealth of context to what animates Xi\u2019s grim determination. The former Australian PM is one of the few westerners to have met him on a number of occasions. A fluent Chinese speaker who worked at Australia\u2019s embassy in Beijing, Rudd completed a DPhil on Xi Jinping\u2019s ideological worldview in 2022 at the University of Oxford.\n\nAccording to his analysis, one of Xi\u2019s formative experiences was the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, a historical moment that resounded through the corridors of power in Beijing as a tragedy (a view incidentally shared by Vladimir Putin). To Xi\u2019s mind, the reasons why China\u2019s huge communist neighbour foundered had a lot to do with lapses in the respect it accorded Marxist ideology.\n\n\u201cAn important reason was that the struggle in the field of ideology was extremely intense, completely negating the history of the Soviet Union, negating the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, negating Lenin, negating Stalin, creating historical nihilism and confused thinking,\u201d according to official Chinese documents attributed to Xi.\n\n\u201cThis is a cautionary tale!\u201d Xi adds.\n\nThus, a mini vogue among Sinologists in recent years to characterise Xi as a transactional pragmatist with few (if any) ideological convictions is erroneous, Rudd\u2019s book makes clear. This should be a useful insight for the new US administration to bear in mind.\n\n\u201cMarxist nationalism\u201d, as Rudd styles it, is set to be the animating philosophy of Xi\u2019s remaining time in office. But what is this likely to mean, in practical terms?\n\nThe answer is that Xi sees himself as on a historical mission to create a \u201cnew era\u201d of Chinese pre-eminence. He will use his all-powerful Leninist party to reinforce his purpose. If he encounters resistance at home or abroad, \u201crelentless struggle\u201d will be deployed to overcome it.

The city-state is home to the Asia-Pacific headquarters of many American tech giants, while their Chinese counterparts have significant operations here, too.\n\nFor global companies, Singapore seems to have it all: English and Chinese are both widely used as official languages here, the crime rate is one of the lowest in the world, and Changi Airport, one of the most efficient and connected in Asia, is less than 30 minutes from the city centre. And most importantly, Singapore has a highly educated talent pool.\n\nAs tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies worsen, Singapore provides a space where companies from both sides can launch their Asia-Pacific and global expansions.\n\nBut geopolitical concerns are never far away. That can be seen in the case of Chinese fast fashion brand Shein, which has an operating company based in Singapore but is facing increasing pressure in the US.\n\nShein, the fast-growing and low-priced apparel brand popular among young shoppers, is eyeing an initial public offering in the US. However, a bipartisan group of American lawmakers has sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission urging it to block the IPO until the company can prove it is not using forced labour in China\u2019s Xinjiang region, write Nikkei\u2019s Rintaro Tobita and Tomoko Wakasugi.\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which took effect in the US last June, essentially bans imports of products made in Xinjiang.\n\nAlthough Shein has said it requires suppliers to buy cotton from approved regions to comply with the legislation, the bipartisan US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) recently released a report detailing allegations about forced labour as well as violation of intellectual property rights.\n\nTemu, an ecommerce platform run by PDD Holdings, operator of China\u2019s popular Pinduoduo, has also come under American scrutiny. The company announced in a recent filing that PDD has relocated its headquarters from Shanghai to Dublin as it plans to ramp up its expansion outside China.\n\nBut regardless of where their headquarters may be located, US scrutiny of Chinese companies is unlikely to let up anytime soon.\n\nA top Chinese memory chipmaker is going forward with a listing in Shanghai that will fund significant expansion, after receiving confirmation from US chip toolmakers they can supply its new production lines, write the Financial Times\u2019 Qianer Liu, Cheng Leng, Eleanor Olcott and Demetri Sevastopulo.\n\nMonths after Washington imposed a sweeping export ban over advanced chipmaking tools, ChangXin Memory Technologies has been told the equipment it needs will not be subject to US controls, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nCXMT, one of China\u2019s biggest makers of DRam memory chips, has resumed expansion plans for foundries that it previously put on hold due to the US export controls. The new plants will manufacture less sophisticated chips for phones, servers and electric vehicles, bypassing the tightened restrictions over procuring advanced chip tools.\n\nTo fund this expansion, it plans an IPO on Shanghai\u2019s tech-focused Star board and is in consultation with at least two possible underwriters for the listing, including Chinese bank CICC, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. CXMT and CICC did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDrivers in China have been quick to embrace electric vehicles, helped along by government incentives and plenty of models to choose from. But a crowded market has set the stage for a brutal price war, writes Nikkei Asia\u2019s CK Tan.\n\nFrom around 200 EV makers today, some in the industry predict that less than a dozen will be left in a few years\u2019 time as intense price pressure forces smaller players and those without deep-pocketed backers out of business.\n\nConsumer expectations of further price cuts risk exacerbating the pain for automakers. Shenzhen property agent Amy Liu, who is looking to trade in her five-year-old electric SUV, says she will shop around for a bit longer. \u201cI will wait it out for the best deal.\u201d\n\nWarren Buffett, chair and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, was full of enthusiasm for Japan at his investment company\u2019s recent annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, writes Nikkei Asia chief business news correspondent Kenji Kawase.\n\nAt the event, Buffett was joined on stage by his longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, for a five-hour discussion covering investing, economics and geopolitics. The 92-year-old billionaire, known as the \u201cOracle of Omaha,\u201d also touched on the move that surprised many observers late last year: selling the bulk of Berkshire\u2019s stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker.\n\nTSMC is \u201cone of the best managed and most important companies in the world,\u201d Buffett said, but the abrupt about-face was made \u201cin light of the situation\u201d, likely a reference to tensions across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nBuffett had much more to say about Berkshire\u2019s holdings in Japan\u2019s five trading houses: Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Mitsui and Co, Itochu and Marubeni. He lauded all five companies \u201creally wonderful partners\u201d, pointing to their \u201cvery, very substantial\u201d operations, handsome dividend payments and share buybacks.\n\nHis appetite for Japan, it appears, is not yet sated. \u201cWe\u2019re not done,\u201d he told his audience in Omaha.\n\nWhile Buffett talked up Japan, the 99-year-old Munger had strong words for the world\u2019s two biggest economies, saying he blames both the US and China for the current economic tensions. The situation was \u201cwrongly created on both sides\u201d, he said. \u201cWe are equally guilty of being stupid.\u201d\n\n#techAsia is co-ordinated by Nikkei Asia\u2019s Katherine Creel in Tokyo, with assistance from the FT tech desk in London.\n\nSign up here at Nikkei Asia to receive #techAsia each week.

Property is the preferred investment for incomers.\n\nSingapore has long been a favourite for wealthy mainland Chinese, who accounted for 31 per cent of all property purchases by foreigners last year. They like the city-state\u2019s independence, the widespread use of Mandarin Chinese and the strong record of capital appreciation of local real estate.\n\nIn recent years, Singapore has also lured more investors from the US, Malaysia and India.

The city-state carefully balances its economic relationship with China and its reliance on the US for security.\n\nBut Singapore has become more active in deepening its defence ties with the US over the past several years, one of the only south-east Asian countries to do so aside from the Philippines, despite its friendly relations with Beijing and a recent influx of people and wealth from mainland China, risking tensions with its largest trading partner.\n\nIn March, the US Air Force-operated RQ-4 Global Hawk, a stealth aircraft known for its surveillance capabilities and capacity to transmit time-sensitive targeting details, was revealed to have been deployed on a short-term basis from Singapore\u2019s Changi airport.\n\nThe previous month, Singapore announced that it would exercise an option to acquire eight more F-35 fighter jets from the US, increasing its order to 12.\n\n\u201cBoth of these actions sent a strong signal about how Singapore feels right now about its strong relationship with the US,\u201d said a former diplomat in Singapore familiar with the government\u2019s thinking. \u201cDeploying Global Hawk in the backyard of the South China Sea? The optics of that send a message.\u201d\n\nFor Singapore, which allows US forces to access its air and naval facilities on a rotational basis as part of a 1990 agreement, the strategic logic is straightforward. It believes an American presence in Asia \u2014 especially its military presence \u2014 is beneficial to its own interests and regional security.\n\nThe F-35 deal was particularly important, said experts, because other US allies in the region, including Japan, South Korea and Australia, had also purchased the stealth fighters. This would enable interoperability \u2014 where one country\u2019s air force flies missions with partners that are similarly equipped.\n\n\u201cBy 2035, there will be an estimated 300 F-35s in the Indo-Pacific region, with the majority in Australia, Japan and South Korea,\u201d said Nicholas Fang, director of security and global affairs at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. \u201cIn the event of a conflict, there is the possibility of a unified network of such aircraft from US allies operating in concert, and Singapore could potentially be a part of that.\u201d\n\nJa Ian Chong, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said the strengthened ties meant that Singapore would be dependent on US military equipment and technology. \u201cThis is Singapore investing in the US system for a good decade or two,\u201d he added. \u201cIt really locks [them] into that defence relationship.\u201d\n\nResearch published this month by Australia\u2019s Lowy Institute think-tank traced how the US-Singapore defence partnership has been upgraded since 2019, with increased arms procurements, more joint training and deployments of personnel and equipment.\n\nThe US Indo-Pacific Command boosted its personnel in Singapore by 12 per cent between 2018 and 2021, according to the report\u2019s authors, while the city-state buys more arms equipment from the US than any other country in south-east Asia.\n\nLast year, Singapore, along with Japan and Australia, for the first time took part in Garuda Shield, an annual joint exercise between the US and Indonesia. In June, the\u00a0US will\u00a0send its largest delegation to attend the annual Shangri-La Dialogue \u2014 billed as Asia\u2019s leading defence summit \u2014 since before the pandemic.\n\n\u201cUnlike the rest of south-east Asia, Singapore is more active in its balancing,\u201d said Susannah Patton, director of the south-east Asia programme for the Lowy Institute. \u201cRather than withholding its support or endorsement from a partner, it looks to actively make itself indispensable.\u201d\n\nFor now, China has not challenged Singapore\u2019s delicate balancing act. But Beijing is also seeking to boost its security relationship with Singapore and south-east Asia, including greater military engagement, raising the prospect of another front for tensions, according to policymakers and officials. This week, China held its first military drills with Singapore since 2021.\n\n\u201cThis potentially creates problems down the track if you rely heavily on US systems and equipment,\u201d said one defence expert who has advised several Asian governments.\n\nSingapore is also grappling with ever-closer cultural ties to China. The city-state\u2019s resident population is more than 70 per cent ethnic Chinese. These connections have grown with inflows of people and capital, with the financial hub a top destination for mainland citizens fleeing restrictive Covid-19 policies and President Xi Jinping\u2019s regulatory crackdown on business.\n\nSingapore\u2019s position has become more difficult as hostility between the US and China escalates, particularly over Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cThere are several points of stress approaching\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009especially as [Singapore\u2019s] economic dependence and cultural ties to China have grown considerably in the past few years,\u201d said Chong.\n\n\u201cThe neutral approach works until it doesn\u2019t. It is unclear what Singapore\u2019s fallback position is when it doesn\u2019t.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0c20823d-2d5f-435e-aec4-269dbe5dafb4"}, {"uuid4": "9acfc836-9743-4cac-804e-42181e77a257", "title": "Singapore doubles property stamp duty for foreigners to 60%", "description": "City-state takes action to cool housing boom partly driven by mainland Chinese buyers", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2023-04-27T07:40:38.965Z", "content": "Singapore has doubled its tax on private property purchases by foreigners to 60 per cent in an unexpected move to cool a housing boom that has in part been driven by buyers from mainland China.\n\nForeigners who have secured permanent residency in Singapore will only pay a stamp duty of 5 per cent, but they will pay 30 per cent \u2014 up from 25 per cent \u2014 if they buy a second residential property. Entities or trusts purchasing any residential property will now pay a rate of 65 per cent, up from 35 per cent.\n\nSingapore\u2019s minister for national development Desmond Lee called the increases \u201cpre-emptive measures\u201d to damp local and foreign investment demand during a renewed spike in interest. Singaporean citizens, who pay minimal stamp duty on house purchases, will now be prioritised, he said.\n\nForeign buyers account for a small proportion of overall property sales. Thursday\u2019s move is the latest attempt by Singapore\u2019s government to rein in property prices amid growing concern that locals are being priced out of the housing market and high prices could make Singapore less attractive as an international financial centre.\n\nThe demand for property in the Asian city-state, which attracts investors for its stability and low taxes, has made it an outlier compared with other global cities including London and New York, where house prices have fallen on the back of rising interest rates.\n\nThe government\u2019s move comes ahead of first-quarter property data due to be released on Friday. Early estimates forecast foreign buyers comprised 7 per cent of purchases in the first three months of this year, up from 4.7 per cent in 2022.\n\nPrices of private homes in Singapore increased by 3.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year, up from a 0.4 per cent increase in the previous quarter, according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority\u2019s flash estimates released this month. Last year, prices rose 8.6 per cent, on top of a 10.6 per cent rise in 2021.\n\nChinese buyers accounted for 25 per cent of foreign purchases of condos in Singapore in 2022, according to government data. People from mainland China have been the biggest group of foreign buyers in Singapore for more than a decade, though they still make up a small fraction of total private property sales.\n\nShares in Singapore property developers, including City Developments and UOL, were set for their worst trading day in more than two years on Thursday.

AT1s are a class of debt designed to take losses when institutions run into trouble but are generally believed to rank ahead of equity on the balance sheet.\n\nThe investors so far had collectively invested close to $70mn in AT1s, enough to attract the interest of four global litigation funds, said two people familiar with the discussions, adding that the number of investors was likely to grow.\n\nThe Singapore discussions could also lead to similar actions by investors in other parts of Asia, where a large number of wealth managers, private banks and rich individuals had bought the Credit Suisse debt instruments.\n\nAt least $750mn of the bonds were denominated in Singapore dollars, 91 per cent of which came from Singapore and another 7 per cent from elsewhere in Asia.\n\nSwitzerland angered bond investors when the government used an emergency ordinance to write down the bonds to zero, even as it orchestrated a deal where UBS will pay $3.25bn to shareholders. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Pallas Partners are among the law firms representing US bondholders who intend to fight the decision.\n\nUnlike the US, Asian countries including Singapore, China, India, South Korea and Japan have unique protections under multilateral treaties designed to protect foreign investment, according to WilmerHale.\n\n\u201cThere are arguments that the Swiss government breached these protections by acting contrary to the investors\u2019 legitimate expectations regarding the hierarchy of claims \u2014 that bond holders will rank higher than shareholders,\u201d said Jonathan Lim, a partner at WilmerHale focusing on international arbitration.\n\nIn contrast with the US, where big funds such as Pimco and Legg Mason were long-term holders of AT1s, Asian investors are typically smaller individuals and enterprises. The Singapore investors\u2019 holdings ranged from $200,000 to $12mn for some of the family offices.\n\nOther lawyers cautioned that a Singapore lawsuit was an \u201cuphill battle\u201d and played down the chances of the investors getting their money back.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t closely assessed the merits of this approach but I would say it will be a difficult argument to win,\u201d said one international arbitration expert.\n\nOne investor, who runs a family healthcare business in Singapore, invested $500,000 of his savings in Credit Suisse AT1 bonds at the beginning of the year.\n\nHe wants the lawsuit to go ahead. \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic but it is better than doing nothing. I want a front-row seat to this debacle and hopefully I can learn something,\u201d he said.\n\nA retired entrepreneur in Singapore said they wanted to participate in the potential legal action because they felt \u201ccompletely misled\u201d over the bonds after investing $700,000 in the AT1s.\n\n\u201cI invested because this was a household brand name.

It has led to an existential issue for some large US regional lenders.\n\nAfter the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank exposed the pressure banks face as rates normalise, billions more in deposits fled smaller lenders, kicking off a high-stakes race on Wall Street to hoover up the extra liquidity. JPMorgan Chase led the pack with $37bn in new deposits in the first quarter, bringing total deposits to $2.38tn.\n\n\u201cThe number one, two or three things to watch this quarter are deposits, deposits, deposits,\u201d Jason Goldberg, a research analyst at Barclays, told the FT earlier this month.\n\nIt\u2019s not just regional lenders that have bled deposits. America\u2019s largest brokerage Charles Schwab has been hit by a strategy of investing customer deposits in secure, long-dated bonds and mortgage-backed securities that have since lost billions in value.\n\nGQG, one of Schwab\u2019s biggest investors disclosed this week that it had sold its entire $1.4bn stake as concerns over paper losses on its bond portfolios spiked last month.\n\nThough JPMorgan is pulling in cash during yet another crisis, its longtime boss Jamie Dimon isn\u2019t getting too comfortable, warning investors on Friday that potential \u201cstorm clouds\u201d are gathering as inflation threatens to tip the US into a recession.\n\nStill, he has more to celebrate than his Wall Street counterpart David Solomon, head of Goldman Sachs, who must unwind strategic mistakes and navigate the economic turmoil.\n\nSolomon has followed up an aggressive cost-cutting campaign with lacklustre earnings punctuated by an 18 per cent slump in the bank\u2019s first-quarter profits because of poor fixed-income trading results.\n\nSolomon has also slapped a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign on home improvement lender GreenSky just 13 months after he steered its purchase for $2.2bn. It\u2019s another step in paring back Goldman\u2019s consumer banking ambitions.\n\nGoldman\u2019s latest collaboration with Apple has come at an opportune time, though, as US depositors explore greener pastures. On Monday, the duo launched a new savings account yielding 4.15 per cent a year, more than 10 times the national average rate.\n\nGoldman has a chance to succeed in its newest push for deposits, but it will be a zero sum outcome. The money will have fled a bank or brokerage elsewhere in the financial system, underscoring that the havoc of rising rates still hasn\u2019t fully filtered through Wall Street.\n\nIn the latest sign that the pharmaceutical market is warming up, GSK has agreed to buy Canadian biotech Bellus Health for $2bn.\n\nBankers have been hoping that the diving valuations in the biotech sector, after a sell-off that started in 2021, would lead to a boom in M&A. Tempted by good deals, Big Pharma would seek drugs to restock pipelines.\n\nBut the past few months have shown that large drugmakers aren\u2019t looking to scoop up undervalued assets. Rather, they are happy to pay a premium for companies with drugs that are in late-stage trials or already on the market.\n\nGSK paid a more than 100 per cent premium for Bellus. And earlier this week, New Jersey pharma titan Merck paid a 75 per cent premium on its $10.8bn deal to buy Prometheus Biosciences.\n\nThere\u2019s a method to Merck\u2019s madness. The company could lose exclusivity over its best-selling cancer drug five years from now, and making expensive dealmaking bets has become a critical survival mechanism for industry heavyweights, Lex notes.\n\nThe deal comes just a few weeks after Pfizer spent $43bn on SeaGen, a cancer treatments maker previously pursued by Merck.\n\nAnd while Pfizer only paid a 35 per cent premium to SeaGen\u2019s previous Friday closing price, that\u2019s just because the oncology-focused biotech had been in talks with buyers for several months. Pfizer\u2019s price of $229 a share was far higher than Merck\u2019s offer of $200 a share last summer, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nFlush with cash, pharma\u2019s internal business development teams may be less interested in nabbing a bargain than ensuring their own job security, people familiar with the matter tell the FT\u2019s Hannah Kuchler.\n\nSo instead of following the money, follow the clinical data: as assets get derisked, more bidding wars could ignite.\n\nThree times a year, executives from some of the world\u2019s biggest private banks \u2014 including JPMorgan, UBS and Citigroup \u2014 sit down with regulators in Singapore to discuss the city-state\u2019s booming industry of private wealth management.\n\nThe forum, known as the Private Banking Industry Group, has been meeting for more than a decade.

Singapore is trying to tread a careful path as a neutral financial centre at a time of rising tension between Washington and Beijing. An influx of Chinese money risks sparking a domestic pushback, widening the income gap as rents soar.\n\nMultiple people who attended the meeting or were briefed on its contents told the FT that the Monetary Authority of Singapore gave a clear message: it wanted banks to avoid public discussion of the origins of the cash that has been flooding in.\n\nThat Singapore would send this message to private bankers, a group not known for high levels of transparency and disclosure about their work, is a sign of just how sensitive the issue has become.\n\nAfter the FT\u2019s story came out, the MAS published a statement on its website saying it \u201chas not issued any directive to banks \u2014 tacit or otherwise \u2014 to avoid discussing the origins of wealth inflows into Singapore\u201d.

The meeting also discussed \u201crobust risk management controls to safeguard against money laundering and terrorism financing risks\u201d, it added.\n\nOne banker said it was not the first time the MAS has used the forum to address large capital inflows from a particular market. In the past, booming Indonesian wealth \u2014 and the local scrutiny it attracted \u2014 concerned regulators.\n\n\u201cThey desperately want to be the regional hub of private banking, and the situation has kind of granted them that wish,\u201d said the banker. \u201c[The Chinese flows] are probably overrunning their best expectations of what was going to happen.\u201d\n\nLawyers and industry groups estimate Singapore had 1,500 family offices by the end of last year, with a large chunk of them from China. The MAS said there were 700 family offices at the end of 2021, up from a handful in 2018.\n\nSingapore has been eager to use financial regulation and government policy to maximise the appeal of its financial services industry and attract wealth, said one private banker briefed by a colleague on the February 20 meeting.\n\nHowever, it is acutely aware of the potential for domestic pushback against the influx of Chinese money and how it could widen Singapore\u2019s income gap, already a political pressure point given the rising cost of living and soaring rents.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese presence is being felt everywhere,\u201d said one industry group executive in the asset management industry. \u201cIt is not just super yachts and luxury cars anymore, it is being percolated down to everyday people and it is a topic of conversation across all layers of Singapore society.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been told explicitly not to talk about\u201d China, the executive added, \u201cbut there is a sense in the financial services industry that talking about it publicly will not be welcomed\u201d.", "tag": "singapore?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ea198ae9-7157-4e3c-9832-2db4cf93d1c2"}, {"uuid4": "f8511ea7-e161-4bf2-8073-c6dd6a03236a", "title": "Singapore overtakes Tokyo in green finance race", "description": "Also in today\u2019s newsletter, junk food is on the menu for activist investors ", "author": "Tamami Shimizuishi", "published_date": "2023-04-07T11:00:55.807Z", "content": "Good morning from New York.\n\nSadly, today\u2019s Moral Money is the last issue I write as a contributor from Nikkei. It has been such an honour to cover the transformation of ESG investing in the Asia-Pacific region as it transitioned from being a latecomer in the field to a global growth engine. From next week, my New York-based Nikkei colleague, Kaori Yoshida, will be stepping into my shoes.\n\nBefore I sign off, I would like to share the top three things which surprised me during my stint with Moral Money:\n\nFirst, the speed at which the field of ESG investing has taken off has been astounding. The industry has evolved from a group of minor financial products to a $40tn behemoth.\n\nBut the backlash ballooned with equal pace. The word ESG leapt from presentations on Wall Street to people\u2019s living rooms as commentators such as Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson argued that ESG was a tool to spread liberal values and erase conservative ideals. During the US 2024 presidential campaign, I won\u2019t be surprised if we observe some of the Republican candidates sparring over \u201canti-ESG\u201d or \u201canti-woke\u201d credentials.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s worth noting how robust the sustainability movement remains despite this strong headwind. Many of my sources have told me that they\u2019re continuing their efforts to decarbonise, even though they may speak less about ESG in public. Some companies said they would keep working on cleaning up their supply chains because it is what investors \u2014 as well as clients and consumers want. As one source in the finance industry told me: \u201cUnfortunately, we have to live in the post-ESG era now. But it doesn\u2019t mean our priority has changed.\u201d\n\nThank you for sharing this amazing journey with me. I won\u2019t say sayonara as I will keep covering the field for Nikkei. So, please stay in touch! You can reach me at shimizuishi_ny@nikkei.com.\n\nThe idea of unleashing the power of Asian investment to guide society to decarbonise was in its infancy when I started covering the region for the inaugural Moral Money in June 2019.\n\nBack then, the term \u201cESG\u201d was still rare in Japan. Yet I thought that the nation\u2019s capital was a strong contender to become a green finance hub. Historically, Japan is environmentally conscious as a small island country without massive natural resources. Corporations have a tradition of taking into account the interests of customers and the local community \u2014 rather than just shareholder returns.\n\nBack in 2019, many executives of large corporations were wearing rainbow-coloured badges, which celebrated the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, like a hot fashion item. And the country\u2019s pension fund \u201cwhale\u201d GPIF had Hiromichi Mizuno \u2014 one of the most influential figures for the global ESG movement at the time \u2014\u00a0as its chief investment officer.\n\nFour years later, however, Tokyo seems to be losing its pole position in the race to become the Asian capital of ESG investing.\n\nAs Hong Kong residents left their city en masse following the implementation of Beijing\u2019s national security law and its zero-Covid policy, there was a chance for Tokyo to grab financial talent from one of its main rivals. But they didn\u2019t head to Tokyo. Instead, Singapore became the preferred destination.\n\nA Hong Kong-based Japanese fund manager \u2014\u00a0who has seen many former colleagues relocate in the past three years \u2014\u00a0said that many people leaving Hong Kong disregarded Tokyo because the city lacks \u201cthe fundamental infrastructure that high-skilled global financial talents would like to keep\u201d.\n\nForeigners can find Japanese culture difficult to integrate into seamlessly. English is not a common language, which can make things difficult if you don\u2019t speak Japanese. Plus, tax codes are relatively unfavourable for high earners and financial businesses. The Japanese tax on financial gains hovers at about 20 per cent, while Singapore has no such levy. And while many expats enjoy having a nanny for their kids or maids at home in other Asian cities, such services are harder to afford in Japan.\n\nMichael Sheren, former adviser at the Bank of England and longtime advocate of sustainable finance, highlighted to Moral Money a few reasons why Singapore has emerged as a winner in green finance over other big financial service hubs such as Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai. For one, in Singapore there were clear efforts taking place between the domestic private and public sectors, said Sheren, who acts as president and chief strategy officer of Singapore-based fintech company, MetaVerse Green Exchange.\n\nFor example, Climate Impact X, a global exchange in high-quality carbon credits, was jointly established by financial institutions such as Singapore\u2019s DBS Bank and Standard Chartered as well as Singapore Exchange and Temasek, the country\u2019s state investor. Singapore\u2019s government has also implemented clear guidelines around voluntary carbon markets \u2014 which would help to drive green finance activity, Sheren said.\n\nHe also noted that Ravi Menon, the managing director of Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state\u2019s central bank, concurrently serves as chair of the Network for Greening the Financial System, which brings together more than 120 central banks to develop recommendations for central banks\u2019 role in climate action. Last year, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero selected Singapore as a location for its Asian headquarters.\n\nBut some still believe that Tokyo has an advantage over Singapore.\n\nKeiichi Aritomo \u2014 executive director of FinCity.Tokyo, a partnership between the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and financial institutions to promote Tokyo as a global financial city \u2014 noted that it is not just a financial trade centre like Singapore, but a gateway to the world\u2019s third-largest economy.\n\nAritomo argued that ESG investors in Tokyo have a chance to make a larger impact on green transformation \u2014 and collect bigger returns \u2014 compared to those in other Asian cities due to Japan\u2019s extensive industry coverage, from high-tech manufacturing to agriculture. Aritomo also emphasised that Japan is fully democratic and politically stable.\n\nYet he acknowledged that Tokyo has some quirks that push foreign businesses away.\n\nDespite its reputation for high-tech gadgets, many business transactions in the country are still conducted in an analogue fashion rather than by digital tools. As a result, documents are often required to be submitted by mail \u2014 or by fax (do you remember that?).\n\n\u201cWe need to get rid of fax,\u201d Aritomo told me. Trade transactions in Japan also involve too much paperwork and were unnecessarily complex, spanning a multitude of different regulators, he added.\n\nAsia is home to the world\u2019s largest emitters, so intensifying competition among cities to become a green financial hub in the region is welcome news \u2014 even though the winner may not be my hometown. (Tamami Shimizuishi, Nikkei)\n\nYou might remember activist investor Carl Icahn\u2019s high-profile but unsuccessful bid to stop McDonald\u2019s use of gestation crates for female pigs last year.\n\nThe latest shareholder challenge to McDonald\u2019s is about human health, rather than animal welfare, as scientists warn that eating burgers from cows fed a cocktail of antibiotics to promote rapid growth can build our resistance to life-saving drugs.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the fast-food giant will announce whether the ballot at its annual general meeting in May will include a proposal for it to comply with World Health Organization guidelines on reducing antibiotic use. Asset managers Amundi and LGIM, as well as Hesta, one of Australia\u2019s largest pension funds, are behind the proposal.\n\nThere is a strong business case for tackling antibiotic and antiviral resistance. Drug-resistant illnesses could compromise the profitability of some healthcare business models, proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services warned in a blog in March. \u201cHumanity is in an arms race with pathogens that are increasingly outsmarting our current stock of weapons,\u201d it wrote.\n\nAs the world\u2019s largest buyer of beef, McDonald\u2019s could lead the way in mitigating these risks, Kim Farrant, head of responsible investments at Hesta, told me. \u201cWhen the efficacy of life-saving drugs [is] compromised, the entire economy suffers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for our portfolio but also for our members.\u201d\n\nMost of Hesta\u2019s pension fund members work in healthcare. It says it now puts antibiotic resistance on a par with climate change and biodiversity loss as a systemic risk to strong and stable markets.\n\nBut two similar proposals it co-filed earlier this year at US food processing companies Hormel Foods and Tyson Foods failed to get majority support from shareholders. And despite ISS\u2019s warning in March, the world\u2019s largest proxy adviser recommended that shareholders vote against these two resolutions.\n\nISS\u2019s own research points to a lack of focus of the issue \u2014\u00a0just 4 per cent of pharmaceutical companies to which it gives an ESG rating are developing antibiotic or antifungal treatments.\n\nAs activist shareholders experiment with new types of health-related proposals, Simon Rawson, deputy chief executive of ShareAction, told me the responsible investment charity focuses its health-related investor engagement on issues such as obesity, tobacco and alcohol use and air pollution, because these disproportionately affect lower-income communities.\n\nFrom antibiotic resistance to animal welfare and air pollution \u2014 it seems likely that health will stay a part of the ESG debate.

But many have found a simple way to cope with all of this: set up a new home in Singapore.\n\nAs a city state of 5.5mn people in the heart of south-east Asia, with a majority ethnic Chinese population, Singapore has long been a popular destination for mainland investment. However, the flows of money, talent and expertise from China have accelerated since 2018, as geopolitics, decoupling supply chains and the pandemic forced a need for diversification.\n\nWhile its own market is small, neutral Singapore is regarded as a key hub from which to deploy capital into the rest of south-east Asia, home to 675mn people.\n\nThis has led about 500 Chinese companies to set up or redomicile in the city in the last calendar year, according to estimates by business groups. The influx has included family office funds, private equity firms and wealth managers. They have all brought expertise and talent from the world\u2019s second-largest economy, ex\u00adperts note, and an eagerness to invest in Singapore\u2019s technology and start-up scene.\n\nSingapore is a \u201cgateway\u201d to south-east Asia and, as such, where many regional start-ups have their holding companies, says Nick Xiao, chief executive of Hywin International, the Hong Kong-based unit of China\u2019s Hywin Wealth.\n\nChinese investors see massive potential in a region with a young, growing middle class where successful innovation and products from China can be replicated, he adds.\n\n\u201cThe financial infrastructure of Singapore has come together to make it the perfect launch pad for Chinese investors wanting to tap into this market,\u201d Xiao says, referring to recent reforms to encourage more investment funds and family offices.\n\nThe benefits to the region\u2019s technology scene are not only financial. Chinese exports include entrepreneurs and expertise \u2014 many of whom have gone on to start their own technology companies in south-east Asia.\n\nBut some start-ups and experts doubt whether Singapore can produce enough talent and sophisticated innovation to put it in the same league as tech-savvy countries, such as Israel.\n\n\u201cThere are a few hurdles for Singapore to be a world-class technology hub,\u201d says the head of one private equity group with a presence in the city, who asks to remain anonymous because of the sensitivities involved. \u201cThe government needs to make it easier for companies to employ foreign tech talent because there is a tech skills and talent gap here,\u201d the private equity chief explains. \u201cI know a number of start-ups that are employing tech roles outside of Singapore because government rules around foreign visas have become so tight. That has a flow-on effect to the level of cutting edge technology that can be developed here.\u201d\n\nSingapore has, however, climbed to second place in the city rankings for the FT/Statista survey of Asia-Pacific High-Growth Companies in 2023. Tokyo leads the city placings with 82 companies, followed by Singapore with 75, and Seoul with 60 groups on the list.\n\nChinese capital has helped foster a generation of start-ups in the region. Singapore-based Grab, the super app offering ride-hailing, delivery and financial services, has received backing from Chinese ride-hailing group Didi Chuxing, Hillhouse Capital, and China Investment Corporation. Both Indonesia\u2019s Gojek and Singapore-based Sea, the parent of online commerce platform Shopee, had Tencent as a major backer.\n\nMany mainland investors have also backed Singapore-based venture capital funds, most of which invest across south-east Asia. Insignia Ventures Partners has a number of wealthy individuals and Chinese tech companies invested across its funds.\n\n\u201cAs much as south-east Asia start-ups take inspiration from China, there are many layers to the region that cannot be fully understood without a local \u2018guide\u2019 or partners,\u201d says Yinglan Tan, Insignia founding managing partner. \u201cThis is where a lot of local investors or GPs [general partners] can step in.\u201d\n\nA number of Chinese funds are expanding their Singapore presence as they scout for investment opportunities. Shunwei Capital, which is part owned by Xiaomi founder Lei Jun, is growing its Singapore presence, according to Linked\u00adIn. Shunwei did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSource Code Capital, another major Chinese venture player that was an early backer of TikTok owner ByteDance, now has a Singapore-based venture partner, LinkedIn also reveals.\n\nWealth managers are fuelling the growth. Hywin\u2019s Xiao says the company is looking at investing in venture capital funds that invest in south-east Asia, or co-investing alongside the local group and paying them a fee for finding the opportunity.\n\nOthers argue that the far greater and long-lasting impact on Singapore comes from the export of business leaders from China.\n\nAccording to research by Asia Partners, a south-east Asia focused investment group, there are more than 13,000 people who graduated from Chinese universities working in south-east Asia tech, of which 557 are founders, co-founders or chief executives. Most \u2014 68 per cent \u2014 live in Singapore.\n\nSCI Ecommerce, a Singapore-based group ranked number 29 on this year\u2019s list, was founded in 2014 by two former employees of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba.\n\nSCI \u2014 short for Singapore, China, Indonesia \u2014 helps multi\u00adnational companies, such as Unilever or Nestl\u00e9, set up and manage online stores in south-east Asia and China.\n\nGeopolitical tensions and the decoupling of China from the west has made south-east Asia more crucial for investors seeking diversification. As the US and Europe grow increasingly hostile to Chinese companies and money, south-east Asia is one of the few regionals globally that welcomes investment from the mainland.\n\nBut others question whether the capital inflows and expertise have been enough to put Singapore on the global map, with many investors still focused on short-term returns.\n\n\u201cCreating world-leading technology and exporting or selling that as a product, globally, takes time and Singapore has not got to that point yet,\u201d says Ravi Chidambaram, chief executive and co-founder of Rimm, a Singapore-based software as a service (SaaS) platform for sustainability management.\n\n\u201cThere are two ways for a tech company to scale: leverage the size of the market or build world-class intellectual property. As a Singapore tech company, yes, you do benefit from proximity to south-east Asia, but not from the massive tech and data science expertise needed to create that world-class IP. To build that type of ecosystem, you need more patient capital and a more liberal labour regime.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/49134abc-60d0-4a39-9903-361f720c9081"}, {"uuid4": "5887cf17-e404-4460-adc1-01d9b10fad87", "title": "Singapore and Hong Kong vie to be the Caymans of Asia", "description": "The two cities have set up new fund structures to lure wealth away from traditional offshore financial centres", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2023-03-20T05:00:04.183Z", "content": "In 2020, the pandemic halted travel and shut borders. But at the same time, two of Asia\u2019s biggest financial hubs saw an opportunity to shift the global centre of gravity for hedge funds and the world\u2019s wealthiest families.\n\nSingapore established the \u201cvariable capital company\u201d, a fund structure that allows a wide range of potential users to shelter large pools of capital in discreet, lightly taxed wrappers domiciled in a well-regulated financial centre. Hong Kong made enhancements to the \u201copen-ended fund company\u201d, a similar structure it had established two years earlier.\n\nThe vehicles are a direct challenge to existing offshore centres such as the British Virgin Islands, Mauritius and the Cayman Islands, and their advocates predict they could herald big changes in the way money is managed.\n\n\u201cWe see this as the start of a massive shake-up of asset management, of family offices and the whole flow of capital,\u201d says a Singapore-based partner of one UK law firm involved in setting up the new structures in both cities. \u201cThis sets the path for [HK and Singapore] to be the heart of a new hybrid between family offices and hedge funds.\u201d\n\nInvestor take-up, particularly in Singapore, has been rapid. The bankers, fund managers and lawyers involved in setting them up say their impact could be far more widespread and disruptive than previously imagined, drawing assets and expertise into the region. To them, the innovations represent exactly the kind of regulatory boldness Asia needs.\n\n\u201cSingapore has always been the poorer cousin compared with the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands and even places like Mauritius,\u201d says Ryan Lin, a lawyer at Bayfront Law, who\u00a0describes the new structure as \u201ca game changer\u201d.\n\n\u201c[The VCC] came just as Singapore became increasingly popular as a wealth and fund management hub\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it was extremely well-timed\u201d.\n\nThe new vehicles represent a direct challenge to traditional offshore finance centres whose success has been built on privacy and low taxes and whose economies are heavily dependent on the revenue generated by financial services.\n\nOthers fear they will create a fertile space for money laundering and tax avoidance. Ma\u00edra Martini, a research and policy expert at campaign group Transparency International, says the risk with vehicles such as OFCs and VCCs is that they \u201cusually function like a black box\u201d and \u201ccan be very attractive to the corrupt and other criminals\u201d.\n\nHong Kong spotted its opportunity in the wake of the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers leaks, which in 2016 and 2017 sparked hundreds of news stories worldwide about the use, and abuse, of offshore funds in the Caribbean.\n\nThe stories made some institutions, especially public pension funds, more cautious about the reputational risks of investing in private equity and hedge funds domiciled in places such as the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands. Investors were looking for alternatives because the public had started to \u201cthink that people only put money into the Caymans to hide something\u201d, says a Hong Kong-based financial adviser.\n\nIn 2018, the territory\u2019s regulators introduced its alternative, the OFC, which aimed to \u201cenrich the choice of investment vehicles and facilitate the distribution of Hong Kong funds internationally\u201d.\n\nOFCs are corporate fund vehicles that are domiciled in Hong Kong and whose units can be offered to the public or held privately. The investments within them must be managed by an entity licensed as an asset manager in Hong Kong.\n\nAccording to the adviser, who has worked on OFCs, the territory \u201cwas trying to capitalise on this trend\u201d as well as attract lucrative business and help solidify its position as a global financial hub.\n\nSingaporean authorities, frustrated at the tendency of local fund managers to register investment vehicles offshore rather than in Singapore itself, launched the rival VCC in 2020. The city-state made it easier for overseas and domestic entities to register an investment vehicle in Singapore provided they had a local entity to manage it.\n\nDespite the \u201cvariable\u201d moniker, VCCs can also have fixed capital, allowing them to cater to a diverse range of potential users including mutual fund groups, hedge funds, private equity, real estate firms and managers of family wealth.\n\nThe single locally incorporated structure can hold a pool of assets and multiple sub-funds, cutting down on costs. It is also covered by more than 70 double taxation agreements, making it less likely that the assets within it will be taxed twice over.\n\nAccording to one lawyer who has established the vehicles, a \u201cbig differentiator\u201d of VCCs compared with traditional structures is that they allow for easy dividend payouts to shareholders. \u201cIn a conventional entity, if you start paying dividends out of capital not out of profits, the regulators will be all over you.\u201d\n\nIn both Hong Kong and Singapore, privacy is another, perhaps even bigger, draw: the names of shareholders are not made public. \u201cThat\u2019s very important because if I was a shareholder and had money in multiple VCCs, I wouldn\u2019t want people to know where I\u2019d invested\u201d, the lawyer adds.\n\nMatthias Feldmann, a senior investment management partner at Clifford Chance based in Hong Kong and Singapore, points out that running costs are relatively modest. \u201cA VCC is\u00a0less\u00a0expensive to operate once set up\u00a0than an offshore fund vehicle\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that is one of the key revenue streams of the government.\u201d\n\nFor both financial centres, longstanding rivals within Asia, there were clear motivations for establishing the vehicles.\n\nHong Kong had an obvious target market: mainland Chinese investors and institutions, some of whom are drawn to the territory for its \u201cfamiliarity and proximity\u201d, says Sally Wong, chief executive of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association.\n\nOFCs can also use so-called connect schemes that allow mainland and Hong Kong investors to buy into exchange traded funds and wealth management products in each other\u2019s markets.\n\nSingapore\u2019s ambition was more subtly aggressive: to comprehensively shed its reputation for sleepiness and to position itself, through regulatory innovation and reputational risk-taking, as the region\u2019s new alpha predator.\n\nThe speedier take-up of VCCs in the city-state is a sign, say lawyers, of how successfully Singapore has managed to position itself as the \u201cnot China\u201d option for both Chinese money \u2014 whether held inside or outside the People\u2019s Republic \u2014 and other cash. Its safe-haven credentials have strengthened as relations between the US and China have deteriorated.\n\nBoth Hong Kong and Singapore introduced generous incentives to encourage registration of the new vehicles, cementing in the minds of investors the idea that it is now government policy to encourage their proliferation.\n\n\u201cThe government is committed to developing Hong Kong not only as a fund distribution hub, but a fund domicile hub. This vehicle [OFC] is part of that package. It\u2019s a strategic objective,\u201d says Wong.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s response to the launch \u2014 and rapid early take-up \u2014 of VCCs was to tweak the structure of the OFC to align it more closely with its south-east Asian rival. In 2021, the Securities and Futures Commission announced the government would pay 70 per cent of all fees to lawyers, accountants and other professional advisers engaged to establish OFC structures up to a value of HK$1mn (US$128,000).\n\nThat is more generous than Singapore\u2019s subsidy of S$30,000 (US$23,000), but the Lion City also offers employment passes to senior managers and owners of the funds.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the managers of more than a dozen funds say they either recently completed or were in the middle of establishing an OFC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we have a fixed idea yet of what might be coming under this umbrella,\u201d says one fund manager who set up an OFC in January. \u201cWe just want to be ready to say \u2018yes\u2019 if, say, a Chinese tycoon calls us and says they want to put some capital into this kind of structure.\u201d\n\nBut Hong Kong still lags behind its rival: 40 OFCs were set up in 2021 and 64 in 2022, a leap from just eight registered in the first two years but still far below Singapore\u2019s numbers.\n\nPart of the reason for this is the long shadow cast by an increasingly autocratic China. Professionals advising on the structure in Hong Kong say privately that one thing limiting the scheme\u2019s take-up is that many Chinese investors prefer to put their money in Singapore, which they regard as being further from Beijing\u2019s reach.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem we [Hong Kong] face: it\u2019s not seen as being truly offshore,\u201d says one adviser.\n\nFor Singapore, the rush to establish the new structures has been especially pronounced. \u201cPrior to 2020, the vast majority of Singaporean managers had their funds in offshore jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands, Mauritius or Luxembourg. Now the tables have turned,\u201d says Mahip Gupta, a partner at Singapore-based Dhruva Advisors.\n\n\u201cSince the variable capital company structure was introduced, most have chosen Singapore as their fund domiciliation hub. Even new fund manager applications have significantly accelerated here.\u201d Dhruva has set up 65 VCCs, and about a third shifted from other jurisdictions, according to Gupta. \u201cA mass onshoring of funds is taking hold,\u201d he adds.\n\nThere were 872 VCCs registered in the city-state as of February, according to government data. That helped drive a record S$448bn in total asset management inflows during 2021, 15.7 per cent higher than the previous year, according to the most recent data from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the island nation\u2019s central bank and financial regulator.\n\nThe number of licensed and registered fund management companies in Singapore increased 15 per cent year on year \u2014 by 146 \u2014 to 1,108 in 2021, the most recent data available.\n\n\u201cThe pace of growth surprised even the MAS,\u201d says one hedge fund manager. \u201cThey had to add more people to meet the demand.\u201d\n\nExperts disagree on exactly who is using the vehicles. \u201cFor large international managers or for institutional managers targeting international investors, the VCC is not yet that common,\u201d says Feldmann.\n\nA hedge fund executive whose firm has used the structures says the incentives offered by both centres do little to attract large blue-chip investors. \u201cThe big guys don\u2019t care about these small subsidies\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It\u2019s pocket change to them.\u201d\n\nBut Anne Yeo, head of funds and investment management for Rajah & Tann, says VCCs have come a long way since their inception in 2020. \u201cIn the past 12 months, we have observed a gradual shift in terms of the VCC being invested into by worldwide global investors.\n\n\u201cMy sense of it is that VCCs serve a complementary role to Cayman or other fund structures,\u201d she says. \u201cWe live in a complex world. There is no single fund structure that is just domiciled in one jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nSingapore\u2019s VCCs have also been helped by the rapid expansion of another piece of its asset management industry: family offices. Large amounts of family wealth shifted to the city-state during the pandemic, especially from mainland China, outpacing arguably even VCCs in terms of growth.\n\nBecause they do not manage third-party funds, single family offices are not regulated by the MAS in Singapore and lawyers say they have been moving into the VCC space. The effect is the creation of an ecosystem pulling in capital from other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cThe area where VCCs and family [wealth] overlap\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009is where single family offices decide there is an intention to take on external money and they start using a VCC structure,\u201d says Vikna Rajah, a partner specialising in tax and trust for private clients at Rajah & Tann. The move requires them to become regulated fund managers, but it is adding to the boom in numbers, he adds.\n\nThe lure of the new structures, and of the capital expected to flow into them, is also beginning to trigger a movement of financial expertise. Singapore requires VCCs to have a fund manager, responsible for due diligence and anti-money laundering controls, based in the city-state. \u201cThat\u2019s very smart,\u201d the hedge fund executive says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to create a lot of jobs for lawyers, accountants and auditors.\u201d\n\nInvestment banks and long-only pension funds in Singapore and Hong Kong have reported a steady recent outflow of both junior and experienced people to family offices or firms involved with the newly established structures in preparation for a flood of new capital.\n\nAt one level, say lawyers, the similarity of the two structures, and the long rivalry between Hong Kong and Singapore for the title of prime Asian financial hub, make the VCC and OFC structures look like weapons in a battle between the two. In reality, they argue, this is about a much bigger proposition to global funds: establishing the two centres as a new and improved offshore destination.\n\nBut by positioning themselves as rivals to centres such as the Cayman Islands, both Hong Kong and Singapore are entering tricky territory. They are trying to lure away the best bits of the Caribbean islands\u2019 lucrative business without also risking the public backlash they have faced for facilitating tax avoidance.\n\nThe two cities must also avoid attracting capital from sanctioned groups, money launderers and others who might be drawn to the lack of public disclosure about the funds\u2019 shareholders.\n\n\u201cLegitimate funds could be mixed with dirty money and used to invest across different sectors,\u201d says Martini at Transparency International. That can make \u201cit difficult for authorities to trace potentially stolen funds\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009To mitigate the risks of these structures being used for money laundering, transparency and regulation of fund managers are key\u201d.\n\nBoth territories say they have put in place such measures. King Au, executive director of Hong Kong\u2019s Financial Services Development Council, an advisory body set up by the Hong Kong government, acknowledges that OFCs could have investors from the US and Europe, potentially including Russia.\n\n\u201cTherefore the fund managers or the banks who distribute the products have to, [through] the regulatory obligations, screen out these unwanted clients or money,\u201d he says.\n\nThat task falls to executives at the groups managing the funds, both in Hong Kong and Singapore. One such individual says \u201creams\u201d of paperwork and due diligence checks have been required; another points out he could be spot-checked by regulators at any time and held personally liable for any wrongdoing.\n\nSome companies may be better than others at screening their investors, says the hedge fund executive \u2014 or be more \u201cwilling to take a risk\u201d. But he agrees that bringing the checks onshore is \u201cthe right thing\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo me the point is they\u2019re trying to make it a real jurisdiction from the start.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88e20280-bb6e-4209-ae76-d7183c60ff62"}, {"uuid4": "dba89aaa-c545-4de5-8512-12da2b272971", "title": "Longtime China investor Anatole to open \u2018outpost\u2019 in Singapore", "description": "Hong Kong-based asset manager had significantly cut its exposure to China", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2023-03-19T00:01:32.540Z", "content": "Hong Kong-based asset manager Anatole is preparing to shift a key part of its business to Singapore, after telling investors it had significantly cut its exposure to China.\n\nThe firm, which made its name through outsized bets on China\u2019s growth, is opening an office in the city-state and may move key functions and decision-making there, said three people familiar with the discussions.\n\nMany Asia-based hedge fund managers were left nursing large losses following a years-long regulatory assault by Chinese president Xi Jinping on multiple sectors from technology to property.\n\nProximity to the mainland through a Hong Kong base has become less crucial for managers such as Anatole as they diversify into fast-growing south-east Asia, home to 655mn people and featuring Singapore as a regional financial hub.\n\nAnatole may keep a smaller presence in Hong Kong, in part to try to avoid falling out of favour in China where it still has its largest exposure, said one of the people.\n\n\u201cThe nervous system is likely going to be in Singapore,\u201d said another person briefed on the negotiations, though they added that the decision had not been finalised and the situation could change. The company registered in Singapore in February, according to the city\u2019s accounting authority records.\n\nGary Lee, Anatole\u2019s chief operating officer, confirmed the group was opening a Singapore office.

Chinese stocks plunged in 2022 as China\u2019s economy ground to a halt during the coronavirus pandemic and after the central government launched a regulatory crackdown on the internet, property and education sectors.\n\nSingapore is rivalling Hong Kong as a financial centre in Asia and has benefited from the latter suffering closed borders during the height of the pandemic. Geopolitical tensions have also increased the city-state\u2019s attraction as a neutral financial outpost and haven for global capital \u2014 including from China.\n\nWhile a number of financiers and law firms have added employees and expanded their offices in the city-state, Singapore has lagged behind in capturing more hedge fund business.\n\n\u201cSingapore is typically where you manage money, Hong Kong is where you make money.

Since 2014, the Mumbai-born, Singapore-based artist has been pursuing Pulp: A Short Biography of the Banished Book, a constellation of films, drawings, photos and a projected five books. The project centres on the precarity of literature and language around the world \u2014 the threats to the knowledge and communities that they represent \u2014 and reflects heartening efforts towards their preservation. Rao had planned to get it all done in a decade, but the pandemic delayed that. She is now just over midway through and intends to finish in 2026.\n\nPulp is \u201cmassive because I don\u2019t know when to stop, frankly\u201d, Rao says from her home in Singapore. \u201cA lot of people think I have ambition. It\u2019s not \u2014 \u201d She stops, a rare pause in her rapid delivery. \u201cMy ideas are always immense. And I just, you know, I just do them.\u201d\n\nIt is the evening of her 48th birthday, but Rao has only recently woken up. She spent the previous night working, and there is ink on her fingers from finishing a piece that will be in the Encounters section of Art Basel Hong Kong (March 23-25). Titled \u201cThe River of Ink II\u201d, it consists of 300 books that she has written in and drawn in, and drowned in ink, and it alludes to the story that the Tigris turned black in 1258 when the invading Mongol army threw the contents of Baghdad\u2019s library into its waters. Rao holds up a few of the midnight-coloured volumes. One has the word \u201cconfetti\u201d on its cover. \u201cWhen you burn books,\u201d she says, \u201cthe ashes that rain down, I call it confetti at a fascist parade.\u201d She opens another to reveal a poetic sentence in silver: \u201cForgetting is the inevitable result of all human experience.\u201d\n\nYou could see Pulp as a bulwark against that process. Rao\u2019s latest volume, Pulp III, and a related film, Talking Leaves, record her interviews with far-flung librarians, activists, archivists and cultural guardians, such as a Singaporean writer who learned the endangered Kristang language and a Bosnian firefighter who battled the devastating 1992 blaze at the National Library in Sarajevo. Representing Singapore at last year\u2019s Venice Biennale, Rao offered free copies of the book and screened the film. The art dealer Fabio Rossi stopped by and was enchanted. She is \u201cso full of interesting things, things that I am interested in, too\u201d, he says. \u201cBooks, literature, censorship, destruction.\u201d From March 18, his Rossi & Rossi gallery in Hong Kong will stage a survey of her art, an opportunity to take stock of one of today\u2019s most freewheeling art careers.\n\nBorn in 1975 in Mumbai, Rao grew up in Darjeeling, then New Delhi, where thieves ransacked a library that her environmentalist mother and civil-servant father had assembled. In the mid-1980s, they moved with their three children to Kaladhungi, an area in the Himalayas rich with wildlife. \u201cWe were never harmed by a single thing, but we were shot at by poachers,\u201d Rao says. \u201cPoachers also tried to set fire to our land because my parents\u2019 idea of an outing was to take us in the jeep and chase down poachers.\u201d They lived in a tent, then a hut, sans running water.\n\nThe historical and the personal regularly commingle in Rao\u2019s practice, just as art has been intertwined with her life from early on. She was bullied at school, and \u201cit was difficult at home\u201d, she says, but she found solace in reading. \u201cGrowing up in India as a woman is \u2014 it\u2019s not advisable, at least not for someone like me, who didn\u2019t have the defence mechanisms in place,\u201d she says. When it was time for college, she opted to study English via correspondence, travelling India on a motorcycle, disguised as a boy \u2014 \u201ca lot of adventures, instead of sitting in class\u201d, she says.\n\nThat disguise presaged her first big project, which she began after moving to Singapore about 20 years ago and deciding to go to art school: a decade of presenting material that she attributed to a man, S Raoul. He was a satire of an obscurantist scholar and his pursuits included creating an immortal jellyfish and inventing a device to prove that contemporary art can induce mental derangement. In this feminist provocation, Rao billed herself as \u201chis prot\u00e9g\u00e9, his confidante, his collaborator\u201d. Regrettably, Rao\u2019s first \u201cRiver of Ink\u201d (2008) installation, which had 100 books, led to his death. \u201cHe tripped over this and broke his neck,\u201d she says cheerfully.\n\nNow operating fully under her own name, Rao has become an in-demand figure from her base in\u00a0Singapore. (Asked about the city-state\u2019s own history of censorship, she says that she addresses it in \u201csubterranean ways\u201d, while contending that \u201cthere are far more books banned in certain states in the USA, for instance\u201d.) She will have a solo show at the Rockbund Art Museum in Shanghai in November and late last year she curated India\u2019s Kochi-Muziris Biennale, which was marked by serious logistical issues and financial shortfalls, leading its president to apologise. (Rao is hesitant to comment \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m still too close to it, and things are still not OK\u201d \u2014 but says she is proud of the show and moved by how artists in India rallied to assist with the beleaguered installation process.)\n\nRao has a few more years left of Pulp, but she already has an idea for another decade-long endeavour, she says. What propels her? While discussing her childhood, she says that \u201cover the years, I accumulated an immense amount of anger. And this anger and rage is very vital and very important. I think it\u2019s an incredibly powerful force.\u201d Some of her S Raoul work has a darkly comic bite, but in Pulp that force yields a moral clarity that is potent yet understated. Her vision is expansive, yes, but this is fundamentally intimate art, focused on championing people who are doing crucial work or simply displaying the majesty of nature.\n\nWhen asked about what she aims to accomplish through Pulp, Rao is quick to say that it takes at least 100 or 150 years for movements to create real change. But then she offers a few thoughts. \u201cI hope enough people understand that the softer, quieter things are really important,\u201d she says, \u201cand much more powerful and enduring than the bombast and spectacle and the noise. That\u2019s my approach to art-making, as well: less spectacle, and perhaps more thoughtfulness.\u201d\n\nMarch 18-May 15, rossirossi.com", "tag": "singapore?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/82cf81a9-3a5d-4c10-a674-908be5d11b1b"}, {"uuid4": "6718399e-4af8-4f7e-a3df-5b7676b86e0b", "title": "Three global cities are pulling ahead since the peak of the pandemic", "description": "Miami, Dubai and Singapore boom by welcoming those chased out of rival international hubs", "author": "Ruchir Sharma", "published_date": "2023-03-12T13:00:35.123Z", "content": "The writer is chair of Rockefeller International\n\nNew York is greeting the exodus of its wealthy citizens with a shrug. The local elite seems a bit too sure that Manhattan is, and always will be, the gravitational centre of the cultural universe, or that the city is better off \u2014 as a professor recently put it to me \u2014 without all the \u201crich douchebags migrating to Miami\u201d.\n\nBut complacency this deep could undo even the world\u2019s greatest city, especially now. The pandemic has shown that remote offices can work full time, making it easier for anyone to relocate and magnifying what I call the cracked mirror effect. Cracks in New York \u2014 high taxes, surging crime, simmering anti-capitalist hostility \u2014 are reflected in the flight to no taxes and a warm welcome in Miami.A similar effect is visible in Moscow, where a heavy-handed Kremlin and world reaction to the war in Ukraine are chasing rich Russians out. Instead they are opting for more hospitable options, including Dubai. Meanwhile, regulatory pressure from Beijing is driving tycoons to buy second homes in Singapore.Millionaire populations dropped by 12 per cent last year in New York, 14 per cent in Hong Kong, and 15 per cent in Moscow. Dubai, Singapore and Miami are deliberately exploiting this migration by opening their doors to capitalists. These global cities rank among the most appealing to millionaire migrants \u2014 and make up the top three among luxury property markets where prices are expected to rise fastest this year.\n\nOn recent visits, I found all of them gaining momentum as people-magnets. Easy lifestyles smoothed by warm climes and efficient governments are drawing migrants from all over; they, in turn, are attracting new restaurants, swanky malls and art festivals.Singapore is the most established of the three: the millionaire population of 250,000 is much larger than those of Dubai or Miami and therefore naturally grows more slowly. Yet here, too, the energy is palpable. Recently, Singapore opened an agency to welcome family wealth management firms. The inflow was so overwhelming that the city is getting more selective about who qualifies for tax incentives. The local joke is that $500mn is the new $100mn, the sum required to get the welcome mat. Driving around I was struck by displays of wealth new to the usually sober city \u2014 one mansion had eight red Ferraris out front.Dubai now offers \u201cgolden visas\u201d that allow the wealthy to buy property and stay. This is drawing in migrants not only from Russia but from across South Asia and the Middle East. A real estate boom is in full swing, driven by eight-figure purchases. Eighty per cent of transactions are made in cash, making the property market more stable than in past bubbles.\n\nDubai still values Guinness World Records as much as high culture: witness the colossus of the new Atlantis the Royal, a boutique hotel but massively scaled up to nearly 800 rooms and 17 restaurants, many run by world-famous chefs. It\u2019s easier to find a great meal there than on the Upper West Side.Miami, once a quintessentially \u201csunny place for shady people\u201d, has also achieved critical mass as a richly interesting city. People move here to avoid taxes, sure, but also to meet their fellow transplants, do deals in the growing financial district, walk the white sands and shop in the new design district \u2014 the first purpose-built luxury shopping neighbourhood in America.Increasingly, unabashedly capitalist cities are finding one another. Business class on the new Miami-Dubai flight is full every day, I was told, forging a direct link between American entrepreneurs and Middle Eastern oil wealth. Many other countries want to emulate Dubai\u2019s success, including Zimbabwe, which hopes to remake Victoria Falls as a similar hub.Manhattanites who say good riddance to the \u201crich douchebags\u201d might consider the Curley Effect, named after Boston mayor James Curley. By the time his fourth term ended in 1950, Curley had deliberately driven most of the rich \u201cAnglo-Saxons\u201d out of his city through incendiary rhetoric and bias. The effect was to deepen its early 20th-century stagnation.New York is not Boston circa 1950, but the exodus is a bad sign. For years, the state has been bleeding migrants to Florida, where the population is now slightly larger but the state government spends half as much \u2014 and the economy grows twice as fast. In 2022, for the first time, Florida had more non-farm jobs than New York.The migration of jobs and capital are leading indicators of development and of decline.

The idea was to secure their commitment while protecting MPs from influence peddling by the private sector. Singapore\u2019s current prime minister Lee Hsien Loong \u2014 Lee\u2019s son \u2014 receives S$2.2mn ($1.6mn) annually, four times what the US president earns. The benchmark level of a minister\u2019s annual income is S$1.1mn, according to government data, much higher than what politicians earn in countries such as the UK.\n\nBut their state salary is only part of Singaporean MPs\u2019 income \u2014 many have outside roles, including \u201cfull-time\u201d executive jobs at companies.\n\nNow fresh questions over the transparency of such roles have been raised after one of the country\u2019s biggest technology companies appointed an MP to an influential position before backtracking.\n\nThe New York-listed Grab is a ride-hailing, food delivery and financial services group that has grown rapidly to have a dominant presence in the city through its \u201csuper app\u201d. Its signature green and white logo is everywhere in the Lion City.\n\nTin Pei Ling from the ruling People\u2019s Action party was appointed as head of public policy for Grab. As chair of the Parliamentary Committee for Communications and Information, she is potentially privy to information that may benefit Grab as well as influence regulatory affairs. Grab is facing regulation that would affect its business, for instance around the rights of gig economy workers.\n\nThere is no suggestion Tin or Grab intended the company to reap benefits it might not have otherwise. And taking a second job as an MP is permitted under Singapore law. The problem was the potential for conflicts of interest to arise.\n\nThe company itself has acknowledged such risks. \u201cMuch thought and care was given to address any potential conflict of interest that may arise when Pei Ling was hired,\u201d Grab said when, in response to a public outcry, it moved Tin to a different role at the tech company in business development.\n\n\u201cThe discourse has led us to pause and reflect on how we can create an environment where Pei Ling can serve effectively in both her roles as an MP as well as representing Grab. We acknowledge that this is difficult if the intent behind every action or position she takes in the future is doubted or called into question.\u201d\n\nTin\u2019s salary was not disclosed. That is not unusual in Singapore. Finding such information \u2014 even the roles MPs hold \u2014 can be challenging. Unlike in the UK or US, there is no list of politicians\u2019 financial interests. MPs are only required to disclose to the prime minister in confidence their business and professional interests and any other fees they receive.\n\nSuch an approach seems an anomaly in transparency to some. Michael Barr, an associate professor in international relations at Flinders University, says: \u201cOne of the most extraordinary things about Singapore politicians is how thoroughly they manage to keep their business interests under wraps.\u201d\n\nMak Yuen Teen at the National University of Singapore believes there is an unhealthy blurring of the lines between government and business in the democratic city-state. As such, a public register of financial interests for MPs would be a \u201cgood idea\u201d.\n\nSingapore still has a strong reputation in governance. While not immune to corruption or scandals, it ranks highly globally as a clean place for business. Last year, it scored 83 out of 100 on a widely used corruption index by the global group Transparency International, beaten only by Denmark, Finland, New Zealand and Norway.\n\nThe next review of Singapore\u2019s public sector salaries, held every five years, is set for this year. At a time of soaring costs for citizens, the salaries of MPs and their roles in the private sector may draw more attention than they have in the past. New leadership and elections are also on the horizon and the PAP is facing declining popularity, especially among younger voters.\n\nIn such an environment, some argue more transparency on MPs and their outside pay might build confidence. \u201cI\u2019m not sure statements like the \u2018ultimate safeguard is still MPs\u2019 own conscience and judgment\u2019 really cut it any more,\u201d says David Black, the founder of Blackbox, a Singapore research firm.\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com\n\nThis article has been amended to remove an incorrect reference to the size of MP salaries in the penultimate paragraph.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nAn \u2018incomplete picture\u2019 of Singapore MPs\u2019 interests\u00a0/\u00a0From TK Lim, Singapore High Commissioner, London SW1, UK", "tag": "singapore?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3d3777cb-2ba2-4a8e-a2dc-ae31cddba7c5"}, {"uuid4": "2b002103-5e03-4a43-89c9-e52a6e79c98d", "title": "How Singapore stacks up against Hong Kong in battle of Asia hubs", "description": "FT analysis of real estate prices, air traffic and other indicators suggests Chinese territory has lost ground in recent years ", "author": "Primrose Riordan", "published_date": "2023-02-27T00:30:55.004Z", "content": "Hong Kong has lost ground to regional rival Singapore, according to a Financial Times analysis of real estate prices, air traffic and other indicators, underlining the challenge the Chinese territory faces as it reopens to the world after years of pandemic controls.\n\nIn recent weeks, John Lee, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, has launched a campaign to convince the world that despite Covid-19 and a brutal security crackdown, the Chinese territory is not only open for business but remains Asia\u2019s premier financial centre.\n\nYet the data demonstrates Hong Kong paid a price for its tough pandemic restrictions and quarantines, while Singapore made gains.\n\n\u201cThe trajectory for Singapore to become Asia\u2019s finance hub\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that takes time.

The city has only just reopened to tourists after three years in which many international airlines stopped their services.\n\nIn contrast, Singapore was one of the first countries in Asia to reopen its borders during the pandemic. Last year, Hong Kong lost its position as the region\u2019s busiest airport to Singapore, according to Sobie Aviation.\n\nMore aircraft have arrived in Singapore than in Hong Kong every month since January 2022, flight statistics show. Arrivals in Singapore have now reached 70 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, while those in Hong Kong are just over half of what they were before the pandemic.\n\nDespite the reopening, severe labour shortages in Hong Kong are preventing the full return of routes.

I think that is holding back Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s clampdown on technology entrepreneurs has heightened Singapore\u2019s attraction as a destination for wealthy elites \u2014 and their funds.\n\nSince mid-2021, Singapore\u2019s foreign currency deposits have increased by more than $100bn, an FT analysis of bank data shows, while Singaporean dollar deposits remain steady. Deposits in Hong Kong banks have dwindled since early 2022, only halting in November as the Chinese city lifted quarantine restrictions.\n\nThe number of family offices in Singapore \u2014 privately run companies that offer wealth management services \u2014 has grown from a handful in 2018 to an estimated 1,500 by the end of last year, according to Singaporean data analysis firm Handshakes. Hong Kong, eager to regain ground, will host an \u201cinvitation only\u201d meeting for some of the world\u2019s richest family offices next month.\n\nPerceptions that Beijing was increasingly anti-business and anti-private wealth was \u201cthe main reason for the migration of Chinese billionaires from mainland or Hong Kong to Singapore and other places\u201d, said Zhiwu Chen, chair professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cIn the past, they might have parked it in Hong Kong but now move to Singapore,\u201d said Kevin Au, director of the Centre for Family Business at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nIt is difficult to quantify how many people have moved from Hong Kong to Singapore and banks \u2014 hesitant to annoy Beijing \u2014 remain reluctant to say how many staff they moved there during the height of the pandemic.\n\nSome had been expanding in Singapore even before the pandemic, especially after the introduction of a tough new security law in Hong Kong in 2020 following protests and unrest. BlackRock doubled the size of its Singapore office in 2022, while Wells Fargo shifted its Asian hub from Hong Kong to Singapore the year before.\n\nAll of this has contributed to rental prices in Singapore surging 40 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year from the same period two years earlier. With 140,000 Hongkongers entering immigration programmes such as the one offered by the UK, rents in Hong Kong dropped 10 per cent in the fourth quarter from an all-time high in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nThis has also affected demand for office space. Grade A office vacancy levels in downtown Singapore stood at 2.3 per cent at the end of last year compared with 11.1 per cent in Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s proximity to China remains a huge draw for investors. In terms of capital market activity, Hong Kong is still far ahead of Singapore, with stock market turnover and market capitalisation more than seven times larger than its rival.\n\nIn the asset management and advisory service industry, Singapore is fast closing its gap with Hong Kong. In 2021, Singapore\u2019s assets under management grew 16 per cent to $4tn, while Hong Kong\u2019s grew by only 2 per cent to $4.6tn.\n\nMore broadly, with Hong Kong open and China\u2019s abandonment of its zero-Covid policy, the IMF has forecast Hong Kong to grow 3.9 per cent in 2023, faster than Singapore\u2019s 2.3 per cent.\n\nSome Hongkongers could yet return. \u201cThere will be some that the political situation in Hong Kong has become intolerable [for], they want to move away and stay away, but there will be some who maybe they could change their mind and economic conditions in the UK or US might not be as good as expected,\u201d said Stuart Gietel-Basten, a demographer at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.", "tag": "singapore?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d74f0b64-7396-4fc4-a417-104775dc99c1"}, {"uuid4": "f1d99beb-6ed9-4d7d-8ad4-e4131d1b5f5f", "title": "Missing Chinese banker was working to set up Singapore family office", "description": "China Renaissance chief Bao Fan was establishing a fund to safeguard wealth before disappearance", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2023-02-22T00:15:57.504Z", "content": "Missing Chinese investment banker Bao Fan was preparing to move some of his fortune from China and Hong Kong to Singapore in the months leading up to his disappearance, according to four people with knowledge of his plans.\n\nThe billionaire founder and chair of investment bank China Renaissance, who brokered some of China\u2019s biggest tech deals, was establishing a family office\u00a0in the city-state to manage his personal wealth in the final months of 2022, the people said.\n\nA growing number of Chinese executives have set up family offices, a privately held company that manages investments, in Singapore after Beijing launched a regulatory assault on the tech sector and an anti-corruption crackdown. They increasingly view the city-state, dubbed the \u201cSwitzerland of Asia\u201d, as a haven to park their money.\n\n\u201cLike many wealthy Chinese since the tech crackdown in China and during the pandemic lockdown, he was trying to diversify his wealth in Singapore,\u201d said one of the people.\n\nBao, a veteran of Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse who co-founded China Renaissance in 2005, disappeared this month and has been unreachable, his company said last week. The bank said it had not been able to contact Bao, who is its chair, chief executive and controlling shareholder.\n\nOfficials in China have not addressed Bao\u2019s disappearance. China Renaissance executive Cong Lin was detained in September last year not long after the Shanghai branch of China\u2019s securities regulator called in Cong for a \u201csupervisory discussion\u201d about alleged violations in the group\u2019s securities unit.\n\nBao\u2019s disappearance has sent a chill through\u00a0international financial and business circles in\u00a0China at a time when Beijing is trying to project a more business-friendly image since relaxing harsh pandemic curbs.\n\nBao had made China Renaissance one of China\u2019s top financial institutions, often winning tech deals from larger Wall Street rivals.\n\nHowever, China\u2019s president Xi Jinping has introduced policies that have hit the tech sector and wealthy tycoons including billionaire Jack Ma, whose listing of Ant Group was suspended by Beijing in 2020.\n\nThe number of family offices launched in Singapore by Chinese nationals eager to secure their family wealth has jumped and many from the mainland have relocated to the city over the same period.\n\nAn individual does not need to be physically present to set up a family office in Singapore, which offers a path to residency. The rise in demand to set up the family office funds and apply for tax incentives has led to long wait times.\n\nWhile getting capital out of mainland China is difficult, many wealthy individuals have assets in places such as Hong Kong, where it is easier to shift money.\n\nIt is unclear if Bao was successful in setting up a fund or if the process is still ongoing. A government portal search showed no family office with Bao listed as director.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to know who is setting these single family offices up,\u201d said one lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivities involved.\n\n\u201cA lot of them use their children\u2019s or spouse\u2019s names as directors while the [Monetary Authority of Singapore] does not license or regulate them as they aren\u2019t managing third party money.\u201d\n\nChina Renaissance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSingapore\u2019s government has taken steps to boost the city\u2019s appeal as a wealth management centre. In 2019, the MAS and the Economic Development Board established a Family Office Development Team to attract more family funds.\n\nThe number of family offices has grown from a handful in 2018 to an estimated 1,500 by the end of last year, according to Singaporean data analysis firm Handshakes.\n\nAdditional reporting by Joe Leahy in Beijing", "tag": "singapore?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d5f8a388-dcd8-4650-858a-b9f74a057d40"}, {"uuid4": "3b6ed633-b6b1-4ac9-9d1e-e4733a521c4c", "title": "Singapore\u2019s soaring expat rents undermine bid to oust Hong Kong as finance hub", "description": "Rising living costs damage city-state\u2019s ambition to lure regional businesses", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2023-02-21T00:30:06.743Z", "content": "Two years ago, Lauren arrived in Singapore from Hong Kong wanting more living space for her growing family. Now, they intend to move back. The reason: a 61 per cent increase in the rent on their four-bedroom flat and the high and rising cost of living.\n\nA British mother of three whose husband works in finance, Lauren, who did not want to use her full name, said her experience of Asia\u2019s two rival financial centres has been an eye opener. \u201cEveryone thinks Hong Kong is the most expensive city,\u201d she said.\n\nHer situation is not unusual in the cosmopolitan city-state of 5.6mn people in which a quarter of the workforce is foreign.\n\nA lack of housing supply due to construction delays during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as a wave of new arrivals from places including Hong Kong, China, Europe and Japan last year, pushed residential rents to the highest on record, according to the government\u2019s private residential property rental index.\n\nRent per square foot in some central areas has overtaken Hong Kong for the first time, data shows. Analysts warn that prices could rise as much as 20 per cent again this year as real estate agents report bidding frenzies for desirable properties.\n\nThe situation underscores the cost of Singapore\u2019s campaign to replace Hong Kong as the Asian destination for money and investment. Tough Covid-19 restrictions in the Chinese territory encouraged many to relocate, and the number of Employment Pass and S Pass holders \u2014 the main visas used by foreign professionals \u2014 increased 4.5 per cent to 338,000 in the 18 months until the end of June last year.\n\nBut higher rental prices could undermine Singapore\u2019s attempts to become Asia\u2019s dominant financial hub and attract the best talent, experts said.\n\nSingapore\u2019s government has been reluctant to help a mostly affluent minority. In November, in response to questions from members of parliament, it said that rent was only one factor for those considering a move to the city-state.\n\nOthers \u201cinclude Singapore\u2019s standing as a global business hub, our strong external connectivity, our good trade links, our education and healthcare standards and the quality of life\u201d, said Desmond Lee, minister for national development.\n\nStill, the high cost of living in Singapore, even with low taxes, is creating\u00a0a \u201creal crunch\u201d, said\u00a0Woo Jun Jie, a senior research fellow at Singapore\u2019s Institute of Policy Studies. \u201cIt is something foreigners face more of the brunt of because most locals live in public housing and go to public schools.\u201d About 80 per cent of Singaporeans live in lower-cost public housing.\n\n\u201cSingapore had a huge influx of people and business since Covid, we were seen as a safe haven during the pandemic. But [high rents] will affect Singapore as a business hub and I think some of it [business] will inevitably flow back into other markets, especially smaller players,\u201d he added.\n\nNicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at the ERA Realty Network, said rents could increase another 10 to 20 per cent this year. \u201cSingapore\u2019s small size means when you apply temperature, things boil fast. There is not a lot of spare capacity,\u201d he said.\n\nEmma, a marketing professional, moved with her family to Singapore from Hong Kong five years ago and was living in a three-bedroom flat in the island-resort area of Sentosa. The landlord informed her in November the rent would increase from S$7,000 ($5,200) per month to S$14,000. When they tried to negotiate, they were told to look in other suburbs.\n\n\u201cOur salaries have not gone up by 100 per cent or even 50 per cent \u2014 that is all our savings,\u201d she added. She did not want her real name to be used for fear of jeopardising negotiations over their deposit. The family has since decided to return to Australia.\n\nShantanu Upadhuay, from India, works at a popular restaurant as front-of-house staff in the city\u2019s Chinatown district. The 29-year-old is also moving to Australia with his fianc\u00e9e after his S$500 rent more than doubled. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself getting ahead here, I have no savings now. In Australia, you can afford a car and have a life,\u201d he said.\n\nReal estate agents agree there is a problem. \u201cI witnessed a crazy incident last year with tenants outbidding each other. It lost control. People are very upset,\u201d said Edna Liong, who liaises with tenants for Huttons Asia. \u201cWhat some landlords are asking for is not reasonable.\u201d\n\nAnother agent, Ina Sultan of ERA, this month made headlines for asking 11 Chinese tenants to vacate their overcrowded flat in a public housing unit. Sultan said: \u201cThe problem of overcrowding is not new here, but I expect to see more of this because of prices.\u201d\n\nThe bigger picture, agents said, was that rents in Singapore were still catching up after years of decline. \u201cLandlords suffered with low rents for many years and nobody brought this issue up,\u201d Sultan added.\n\nIt is clear that for all its attractions, high costs in Singapore are becoming a deterrent, said Jon Goldstein, managing partner of Page Executive Singapore, an executive recruiter. \u201cThe question at the mid-level of \u2018should we stay or should we go\u2019 \u2014 you are hearing that discussion a bit more.\u201d\n\nEven those who have found apartments are unsure about the future.\n\n\u201cIf you told me five years ago I would be paying S$6,500 for a very old three-bedroom apartment, I would have said that is insane,\u201d said Marta, a 34-year-old working mother who also did not want her full name to be published for fear of jeopardising her visa.\n\nShe moved to the flat last year after her previous landlord asked for a 60 per cent increase in rent. \u201cThis was the best option we could find, but after this lease expires we may consider leaving.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ec0f0ddf-d6b0-40b4-80f9-8287df941db2"}, {"uuid4": "ac16fdd7-935b-4d08-afc4-1333d6247938", "title": "From Grab to Ant, Singapore\u2019s digital bank race picks up pace", "description": "Standard Chartered and other incumbents take lead in push for virtual lending", "author": "Tsubasa Suruga", "published_date": "2023-02-20T23:00:06.808Z", "content": "Digital banking is accelerating in Singapore as deregulation encourages tech companies like Grab to enter the market in the hope of attracting younger customers and small businesses.\n\nWhile this is expected to foster banking competition, retail virtual banks have yet to bring their operations fully online because of lingering regulatory restrictions. Meanwhile, incumbents like Standard Chartered are digitising their services at an accelerating pace.\n\nGXS, a digital bank majority owned by Grab, operator of south-east Asia\u2019s ubiquitous superapp, has expanded services since opening in September. GXS\u2019s app hardly looks like a banking app. With its black and purple colour scheme, it has more of a music-streaming vibe.\n\nThe app updates GXS account holders with daily reports on how much interest their deposits have accrued. While a regular savings account offers 0.08 per cent interest, time deposits, opened for specific purposes such as travel or layaway purchases, earn 3.48 per cent. GXS hopes to increase user engagement by letting customers see the interest they earn every day.\n\n\u201cWe are a bank created by digital natives for digital natives,\u201d CEO Charles Wong told Nikkei Asia. GXS is targeting so-called gig economy workers like those who deliver meals or give commuters rides via the Grab app. The bank also looks to lure those just starting out in their careers. There is no minimum balance or account maintenance fees.\n\nGrab owns 60 per cent of GXS, with Singapore telco Singtel holding the rest. The partners have a combined local customer base of more than 3mn and can gather reams of data that will tell them what their account holders like to eat, where they commute and how much they use their mobile phones. GXS executives believe that by analysing this data, the bank can offer timely small loans, insurance products and other financial services.\n\nDeregulation has made it possible for nonbank companies such as Grab to enter Singapore\u2019s virtual lending market. In June 2019, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced the creation of two licences, including a digital full banking licence, which allows holders to serve individuals and other customers. It also announced a digital wholesale banking licence, with plans to issue up to five of the new licences in total.\n\nThe Singaporean central bank was responding to similar moves by other Asian countries. In South Korea, internet giant Kakao got into banking in 2017, and Hong Kong issued digital banking licences in 2019.\n\n\u201cWe must take advantage of these opportunities that digital finance brings,\u201d MAS chair Tharman Shanmugaratnam said, \u201cand not be overtaken by the wave of changes taking place globally.\u201d\n\nInterests were high during the four-month filing period, when 21 companies and groups, including foreign entities such as Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, submitted applications for digital banking licences in Singapore. Another Chinese tech giant, ByteDance, owner of the TikTok video-sharing app, was reportedly among the applicants.\n\nIn the end, the Grab-Singtel consortium and Singaporean ecommerce player Sea were granted digital full banking licences. But despite high hopes, neither has made much of a splash in the nascent market. GXS provides services to selected Grab and Singtel clients, while Sea is rolling out on an invitation-only basis. Neither has disclosed precise customer numbers.\n\nLingering regulations aimed at ensuring digital banks\u2019 financial stability are behind the slow rollout. For retail services, one regulation caps aggregate deposits at S$50mn ($37mn) during the entry phase. The government has yet to announce when full-scale services will be permitted.\n\nIn the meantime, Standard Chartered, one of the UK\u2019s largest banks, has begun operating a digital bank called Trust Bank, which has attracted more than 400,000 users in four months. Trust Bank was founded with FairPrice Group, operator of Singapore\u2019s biggest supermarket chain.\n\n\u201cBanks have to transform themselves from being just a bank to becoming part of an ecosystem,\u201d Dwaipayan Sadhu, CEO of Trust Bank, told Nikkei. Trust offers deposit accounts, credit cards and insurance policies through an app. Customers can earn loyalty points and coupons from partner brands.\n\nFreed from the expense of operating physical outlets, the digital bank can lower the cost of winning customers and share the savings with them in the form of higher interest on their deposits, Sadhu said.\n\nTrust obtained a licence that allows it to offer services similar to those of conventional banks. It developed a core banking system, which resides on a cloud platform, jointly with Thought Machine, a British unicorn that counts JPMorgan Chase as a shareholder.\n\nMeanwhile, Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Chinese tech giant Alibaba, obtained a digital wholesale licence, which allows it to conduct transactions for corporations. Ant\u2019s digital-only Anext Bank allows companies registered in Singapore to open an online corporate account in an instant, even from overseas, a first in the city-state, the bank says.\n\n\u201cWe are clear on our mission to accelerate financial inclusion through technology-driven innovation,\u201d Anext CEO Toh Su Mei told Nikkei, adding that the bank intends \u201cto better serve the underserved SMEs [small and medium-size enterprises] not just in Singapore but also across the region\u201d.\n\nThe bank\u2019s online loan service, which will become fully available by June, does not require application forms for unsecured loans of less than S$30,000 with a cap of S$300,000. The service instead sifts through data provided by credit information organisations, with customer permission, and deposits approved loans almost immediately upon receiving an application.\n\nIn one estimate, about 80 per cent of Asia\u2019s cross-border ecommerce services are operated by small to medium-size enterprises, many of which lack ready access to financial services. In a 2020 survey by Visa, 88 per cent of SMEs in Singapore said they planned to make at least some of their transactions digitally.\n\nBut it remains to be seen how much of a share digital banks can take. Singapore is said to be overbanked as it is, with 98 per cent of the adult population already account holders. Globally, there are about 250 digital-only banks. According to Moody\u2019s Investors Service, their combined banking assets represent 0.4 per cent of those of traditional banks.\n\n\u201cWe can expect the retail banking market to grow\u201d in Singapore, Jan Ondrus, associate professor of information systems at ESSEC Business School Asia-Pacific, told Nikkei. \u201cThe new digital banks will not replace the traditional ones but complement their offerings, at least in the early days.\u201d\n\nIn the medium to long term, digital banks are expected to utilise their technology in other markets in south-east Asia, where, unlike in Singapore, many residents remain unbanked or underserved. Moves to issue digital banking licences are afoot in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Grab plans to open digital banks in Indonesia and Malaysia this year.\n\n\u201cWe have in place a regional technology architecture, including our core banking system, which our digital banks in Malaysia and Indonesia can tap or repurpose,\u201d GXS\u2019s Wong said, describing a set-up that will keep costs low as Grab opens banks in more countries.\n\nStill, a bumpy road lies ahead for tech companies struggling with their core businesses. Sea has cut staff, and Grab has frozen employee recruitment. Both are operating in the red and have less scope to invest heavily into new services now than when they filed for their digital banking licences in Singapore.\n\n\u201cMost of the incumbent banks have trusted brands, large customer bases and a broad set of products and services that drive profitable business models,\u201d Eddy Kwong, director and digital business lead for Asia Pacific at Allianz Global Investors, told Nikkei.\n\n\u201cDigital banks have not had the time to develop these capabilities yet and face the uphill battle of tackling customer aversion to change,\u201d he added.\n\nThis story has been amended to correct a reference to regulations governing retail deposits.\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on February 27 2023. \u00a92023 Nikkei Inc.

It has also significantly slowed the pace of its direct investments in private Chinese companies.\n\nAlthough GIC was an early backer of China\u2019s economic growth story, some of the fund\u2019s most senior figures have struck a more cautious tone on investing in the country during internal discussions over the past year, two of the people said.\n\nThe fierce debate inside one of Asia\u2019s most powerful sovereign wealth funds reflects concern over how some of Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s policies might affect investors despite the end of zero-Covid curbs that hit growth last year.\n\n\u201cThey have dramatically decreased investments,\u201d said one executive who had sought to tap GIC for funds to invest partly in China, adding that the \u201cpivot\u201d came at a time when it was difficult for funds to find other places to invest on the same scale.\n\nITjuzi, a data provider that monitors investments in China, recorded just two direct investments in Chinese companies by GIC last year, down from 16 in 2021.\n\nExecutives and senior managers are uneasy about growing geopolitical risk from souring US-China relations and are concerned that Xi\u2019s \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d drive to reduce economic inequality in the country could have unintended negative consequences, two people close to GIC\u2019s decision-making process said.\n\nGIC, chaired by Singapore\u2019s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong, has an estimated $700bn under management and has reaped impressive financial returns from China over almost three decades.\n\nBut GIC\u2019s investments in China, which it does not quantify, have been hit by the country\u2019s property crisis and Beijing\u2019s crackdown on its own tech companies. The fund has been a significant investor in Chinese real estate and owns a stake in Ant Group, whose planned $37bn\u00a0initial public offering was halted by Chinese regulators in 2020.\n\nThe fund was \u201cburnt bad\u201d by the crackdown on Ant and has become wary of other unexpected moves from Beijing that could hit its investments or its ability to exit them, one of the people said.\n\nInvestors said GIC executives indicated they were pausing investments and slowing decision-making commitments to China but were open to future discussions.\n\n\u201cThis is consistent with what many sovereign wealth funds and pension funds are doing,\u201d one of the people said. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019re among the first to come back\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. they know China much better than others.\u201d\n\nPrivate equity and venture capital funds targeting China deals raised a total of $108bn in 2021, up from $23bn in 2010, according to Preqin data, a sign of how capital has flooded into the country as its economy has boomed.\n\nBut fundraising slowed globally last year, as investors became more cautious about locking up their cash in illiquid funds.\n\nThe size of GIC\u2019s publicly disclosed stakes in listed Chinese companies, a more liquid investment, fell 4.4 per cent in the year to December 2022, according to Bloomberg data, though it has risen 11 per cent since. The data does not include stakes that are below disclosure thresholds.\n\nGIC, which has offices in Shanghai and Beijing, said it still had \u201csignificant exposures\u201d to China and that it \u201ccontinues to explore long-term opportunities\u201d.\n\nA quarter of GIC\u2019s overall portfolio was invested in Asia, excluding Japan, in the year to March 2022, according to its annual report.\n\nThe reductions in China came as GIC ramped up overall investment.

This followed the release in February of green skillset guidelines, which aim to encourage firms to design new training programmes.\n\nThe moves are part of a wave of new regulatory requirements in Singapore and have been met by calls for greater clarity from financial institutions.\n\nWhile fund companies now view incorporating ESG practices as integral to their business, questions are being raised about the resources needed to keep up with all this new regulation.\n\n\u201cHow do you square increasing regulations and operational costs with ESG as a growth driver \u2014 it\u2019s almost like a chicken and egg problem,\u201d said Ng Sze Yoon, Singapore-based principal of distribution insight for Asia Pacific at Broadridge.\n\nESG is becoming more of an \u201cinfrastructure capability\u201d as opposed to a standalone investment strategy, said Ng, and asset managers now needed to integrate it across the entire business, including investment products, servicing and operations.\n\nExisting ESG regulations and standards are also evolving and shifting, with many asset managers currently facing challenges complying with the European Union\u2019s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\u2019s level two standards, for example, which recently came into force.\n\nThe SFDR\u2019s level two standards come with a stricter definition of what can be classified as the \u201cdarkest green\u201d Article 9 fund, as well as an increased reporting requirement for such funds.\n\nBNPP AM\u2019s Ou Yong said the French manager\u2019s global sustainability team had more than tripled since 2019.\n\nDespite the rising costs of having to comply with ESG regulation, more than two-thirds of Singapore fund firms see increasing investment into ESG strategies as the top expected driver of growth over the next three years, according to an Investment Management Association of Singapore survey, with many viewing it as a means to achieve differentiation.\n\nSustainable investing remains \u201cif not the main, it\u2019s one of the strategic growth drivers\u201d for BNPP AM in terms of flows and asset growth, said BNPP AM\u2019s Ou Yong.\n\nBut for managers that are not making ESG a priority, the pace of development in ESG regulations means that time is running out, as institutional investor expectations rise.\n\n\u201cAnybody who wants to stand out beyond the rest of the playing field has to demonstrate a lot more ESG credentials and capabilities,\u201d Broadridge\u2019s Ng said.\n\nGrace Chong, Singapore-based counsel and head of the Singapore financial regulatory practice at Gibson Dunn, said fund firms also had to think about the increasing risks of not complying.\n\nMany firms are also banking on the fact that Hong Kong and Singapore broadly accept SFDR standards as being locally compliant, but local regulators could add their own additional requirements at any time.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

In the Lion City I had a house to lay my head in, but work often required me to road-test hotels both new and established, and I was asked by friends often enough for recommendations that I kept my finger on the pulse of who was doing what, where. Now that I\u2019m no longer a local, Singapore\u2019s hotels feature more holistically in my experience of the city; based on what I\u2019m travelling for (work, friends, a stopover I need to cram both into), I care about neighbourhood, size, vibe and service. (Ah, service in Singapore. Still occasionally a bit of a blip issue\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.)\n\nThe good news is the hotel scene seems to be evolving into something befitting the size and sophistication of Singapore. An Edition, a Mondrian and a Standard are all in the pipeline \u2014 youthful brands with high design and reputations for plugging ably into local scenes. And Raffles is set to plant a second Singapore flag on Sentosa Island later this year. So whether you\u2019re after a deep-dive into the cocktail-bar scene or a poolside loll followed by a Michelin-starred dinner, there will soon be more choice than ever. Meanwhile, here is a selection from among the city\u2019s very best options, for different agendas.\n\nThe USP: Its heritage. From the name (taken from Singapore\u2019s colonial founder, Sir Stamford Raffles) to the Long Bar (welcoming peanut shell-chucking expats since the early 1900s), it\u2019s one of south-east Asia\u2019s most storied hostelries, a semaphore in white stucco for the Lion City\u2019s British East Indies history. In 2017-19 it underwent a total renovation by New York-based designer Alexandra Champalimaud, and while some of the public spaces gleam almost unrecognisably with slick new finishes and crystal lights, the overall Raffles gentility is still intact.\n\nThe rooms: There are 115, and thanks to the building\u2019s generous proportions, the most modest (about 500 sq ft) puts rooms that call themselves suites in other hotels to shame. Champalimaud\u2019s intervention was, cleverly, minimal. A few choice furnishings have been updated from \u201980s staid to 21st-century low-slung: spacious armoires gleam with polished metal and leather linings; pretty encaustic tiles adorn the bathrooms. But the original hardwood floors remain, as do the lazily spinning ceiling fans and four-poster beds. And the long, shared verandas are, blissfully, still long and shared.\n\nFood and drink: A smorgasbord of destination tables, many of which are primarily the preserve of tourists and businesspeople. You can still throw peanut shells at the now quite gussied-up Long Bar, but the Writers Bar next to the lobby, with its tryst-ready corners, is the chicer drinks venue. Take the constituents you need to impress to Anne-Sophie Pic\u2019s stellar La Dame de Pic or to Y\u00ec, where Jereme Leung does very haute Chinese cuisine. Refined primi piatti and Super Tuscan reds are served at Alain Ducasse\u2019s cheery Italian, Osteria BBR, formerly the hotel\u2019s Bar & Billiards Room. But for my money, the most fun is to be had at Butcher\u2019s Block, where Hawaiian chef Jordan Keao does brilliant, kind-of-Hawaiian, kind-of-Asian things with both meat and veg in his open kitchens.\n\nSpa: A gorgeous one in the Raffles Arcade, a three-minute meander from reception.\n\nGym: Yes \u2014 it\u2019s not huge, but serviceable, with personal training available.\n\nRates: Double, from S$1,300 (about \u00a3795)\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nThe USPs: Space, service and extreme family-friendliness.\n\nMore of a small citadel than a hotel, the flagship Shangri-La comprises the Tower, Garden and Valley Wings. The pool is truly enormous; the 15 acres of landscaping are mature and lovely; the Garden Wing\u2019s terraces overflow with pink bougainvillea. There are space-, safari-, castle-, underwater-, treetop- and space-themed suites for the tots. But there are also concierges to service any and all business needs, from cars to translators \u2014 as well as an excellent Club Lounge, and some of the speediest butler service I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nThe rooms: Besides those themed kiddie suites, design-wise things are fairly straightforward, if also comfortable. The Tower Wing rooms are spare and a bit monochrome, but well configured for work, with large desks (often set in a window, so you face out to the view), plenty of outlets and good lighting. The bathrooms are smallish but good, clad in marble and dark wood. For longer stays, the Horizon Club Junior suites are like little apartments, complete with slick kitchenettes and dining areas.\n\nFood and drink: As at Raffles, the options here cut a wide swath, from Italian at Waterfall to sashimi at Nami to a sublime version of chicken rice \u2014 that staple of hawker centres \u2014 in the patrician Lobby Lounge that earned its not-so-hawker-centre price tag. Breakfast at The Line is a thing of wonder: a United Nations of regional specialities \u2014 nasi goreng, siu mai dumplings, bagels, Cronuts and every imaginable thing in between, spread across what feels like acres of counter and cart space.\n\nSpa: One of the best in town, and a favourite of locals. Shangri-La\u2019s Chi brand is well established, and this one is a hushed, private enclave done with low lighting and lots of warm wood and colour.\n\nGym: Yes, with row upon row of Life Fitness aerobic machines. A bonus: the hotel\u2019s two outdoor tennis courts.\n\nRates: Double, from S$380 (about \u00a3230)\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nThe USPs: A colonial \u201cgodown\u201d (warehouse) that eventually became a disco, which became the first hospitality project of local restaurant impresario Wee Teng Wen (whose Lo & Behold group counts some of the city\u2019s finest drinking and dining venues in its portfolio), The Warehouse is, for now anyway, Singapore\u2019s design hotel par excellence. Local firms Zarch Collaboratives and Asylum recast the old spaces with clever lighting, lots of smoothed concrete and some post-industrial-vibes beams and metalwork.\n\nThe location, right across the river from Robertson Quay, is ideal for foodies (there\u2019s a plethora of good eats within walking distance, from high-end Neapolitan pizza to old-school chilli crab), runners and walkers (the river paths, which run all the way to Marina Bay, are great for otter-spotting), and anyone who wants a change from the touristic Orchard or Beach Roads, or the CBD, Singapore\u2019s business and financial district.\n\nThe rooms: Understated, minimal but not cold, and very clever in how they leverage space. All 37 rooms and suites have elegant freestanding units variously combining wardrobe, workspace, storage and minibars. Floors are smooth timber; bedding is soft and cozy; bathrooms have big showers and generous sink space \u2014 even the very compact Warehouse Sanctuaries, the smallest room category. The River View Mezzanine has a soaring ceiling and tons of natural light; the River View suite is a single-level loft, with a sexy open-plan bathroom.\n\nFood and drink: The Lobby Bar is also the lounge and reception in one unstructured space \u2014 but it works, with a sunken bar along one wall and long, low butterscotch-leather sofas arranged in seating areas along the room\u2019s perimeter; it\u2019s a great place to invite friends to start off an evening. Po, the small restaurant adjacent to the lobby, elevates heritage and home-cooking traditions \u2014 in this case, Singapore\u2019s own. Delicious, carby Asian comfort food.\n\nSpa: No\n\nGym: No, but there is a small rooftop pool.\n\nRates: Double, from S$404 (about \u00a3250)\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nThe USPs: Maxwell Reserve, housed in a century-old British colonial-administration building, started out in 2019 as one half of the Six Senses Singapore, which retired the management account in 2020; the other half, Duxton Reserve, now comes, like Maxwell, under Marriott\u2019s Autograph Collection. The three-storey building sits at the border of Chinatown and Tanjong Pagar, two of Singapore\u2019s culturally and architecturally most interesting neighbourhoods (the latter also one of its nightlife hubs \u2014 you\u2019re in striking distance of some of the city\u2019s buzziest cocktail bars and restaurants, as well as the Maxwell Food Centre, reliably good for all sorts of hawker specialities).\n\nThe rooms: All 138 were designed by Jacques Garcia, so are heavy on jewel tones, velvet, Persian rugs and passementerie. The 160 sq ft Petit Club rooms are compact, but perfect for a solo traveller, with alcove beds framed in a peacock-feather jacquard fabric and plenty of daylight. The Junior Club and Salon Club suites have multiple windows and generous separate seating areas. The minibars, stocked with small-batch spirits, craft aperitifs and gorgeous mixing kit, are a win.\n\nFood and drink: Several on-site options, including an Indian restaurant, Shikar, and a steak house called the Officer\u2019s Mess Polo Bar, as well an almost outr\u00e9 jewel-box drinking establishment, Isabel, with a backlit pink-onyx bar and yet more red velvet (fun for the \u2019gram addicts, perhaps). But the fact is, in this neighbourhood you\u2019ll probably be eating elsewhere.\n\nSpa: No, but there is an outdoor rooftop lap pool.\n\nGym: Yes, small but serviceable.\n\nRates: S$420 (about \u00a3255)\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nThe USPs: Island-idyll feels; marquee-name architecture; serious luxury.\n\nSet on the south-west side of Sentosa Island, about a 20-minute taxi ride from the CBD (on a good-traffic day), this was the first Capella hotel to open, 14 years ago. Sentosa is home to golf courses, yacht clubs, and an integrated resort or two; there\u2019s a Disney-esque vibe to much of the island, but there are also quite lovely parts, where dense greenery gives way to South China Sea views, imparting passable island-holiday vibes. The Capella, on a nicely landscaped hill, enjoys one of the best vantages, in two late 19th-century Tanah Merah colonial barracks joined by a sinuous extension courtesy of Foster + Partners. No wonder it\u2019s a staycation favourite \u2014 it very much says \u201cresort\u201d rather than hotel.\n\nThe rooms: Capella is a five-star enterprise all the way, and this is reflected in the design. Entry-level rooms are long, large and softly contemporary, with gleaming timber floors and picture windows overlooking the water (usually dotted with supertankers, but still). The suites carry the design over into bigger spaces with separate sitting areas, while 38 villas take it into serviced private-residence dimensions, all with plunge pools and terraces. Three manor houses \u2014 two colonial, one contemporary \u2014 offer the full Monty: multiple en suite bedrooms, dining rooms, cook\u2019s kitchens and their own pools and terraces.\n\nFood and drink: What you\u2019d expect at a place of this calibre, ranging from Fiamma (a new Italian overseen by star chef Mauro Colagreco) and Cassia (contemporary Chinese, in a stunning room designed by Andre Fu) to Bob\u2019s Bar, which capitalises on the resort\u2019s prime sundowner position with outdoor seating.\n\nSpa: Yes \u2014 the Auriga spa, a multi-award-winner that offers Biologique Recherche facials and a daunting number of combination-treatment Wellness Journeys (with attendant price tags).\n\nGym: Also excellent, all Technogym aerobic equipment, full weight circuits, and personal trainers by appointment.\n\nRates: Double, from S$1,600 (about \u00a3980)\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nThe USPs: A centre-of-the-action location on Collyer Quay; fast, polished service; proximity to the CBD.\n\nThe ace in Fullerton Bay\u2019s pocket is arguably its situation: overlooking Raffles Place, the Singapore Flyer big wheel and the three infinity-pool-crowned towers of the Marina Bay Sands hotel-casino complex (you could stay there, but trust me \u2014 it\u2019s better to wonder at the spectacle from these coordinates). It happens to also be a lovely hotel: modern, full of light, with elegant interiors by Andre Fu and a youthful staff who\u2019ve always impressed during my various stays. And there are few better places to catch the nightly Spectra light and water show than from a table at Lantern, the Fullerton Bay\u2019s rooftop bar. It\u2019s an easy 10-minute walk to Marina Bay Sands and its gargantuan shopping mall offering (which runs the gamut from C\u00e9line to Din Tai Fung), and a further 10 minutes to the weirdly wonderful Gardens By The Bay. The CBD is an easy walk in the other direction.\n\nThe rooms: They do the job, in the best possible way. The entry-level double is more than 450 sq ft, with clever sliding partitions separating the bathroom from the bedroom, for enjoying the views while you soak in the tub. Every one of them has a well-provisioned work area and a small separate sitting area. The windows throughout the hotel are floor-to-ceiling, so light is a USP all day. A few of the Bay View rooms have terraces with Jacuzzis. Design throughout is what you might call subtle contemporary pan-Asian: glossy hardwood details, hits of bold-hued silk, lots of orchids.\n\nFood and drink: Breakfast is served in La Brasserie, a pretty double-height space at ground level that\u2019s also open for lunch and dinner. With its more than 200 covers, The Clifford Pier, the hotel\u2019s heritage lobby restaurant, is vast, though pretty; and there\u2019s an equally attractive afternoon tea with views served at The Landing Point. But Lantern and its views are probably the winner here, given how easy your access is from the Fullerton Bay to many of Sing\u2019s favourite eateries in Tanjong Pagar and Telok Ayer (another easy, if occasionally sweaty, 10 or 15-minute walk).\n\nGym: Yes, full service, and a 25m lap pool on the hotel\u2019s roof.\n\nSpa: Not on site, but guests have booking privileges at the spa at the Fullerton Hotel, about a 10-minute walk up Fullerton Road.\n\nRates: Double, from S$901 (about \u00a3550)\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nThe USPs: A CBD-meets-Chinatown location; value for money; cool architecture creds.\n\nWOHA is one of Singapore\u2019s most laurelled architecture firms, having designed local rapid-transit stations, luxury resorts on Bali and even a university campus in Bangladesh. And the Oasia is one of the most distinctive buildings on the Singapore skyline, thanks to its striking combination of bright-red aluminium mesh cladding and lush green vertical plantings, evidencing a full 21 different species. Three interior \u201cverandas\u201d \u2014 entire floors given over to outdoor space \u2014 create additional bio-havens (the green \u201cquantum\u201d WOHA has achieved here is tantamount to requirements for 10 whole buildings). This means two outdoor pools, plus a yoga lawn \u2014 all many storeys above the city.\n\nRooms and suites: Nice clean lines and lots of light wood, minimal frippery \u2014 the basics you need (a good bed; a wall-mounted TV with lots of channels; a small but serviceable work space; natural light; bathtubs in the Club rooms), and not much you don\u2019t. The views-for-days from most of them are a bonus.\n\nFood and drink: There\u2019s all-day simple dining at The Marmalade Pantry, on the hotel\u2019s ground floor (think salads and sweet-potato fries, a handful of pastas and fancy sandwiches), which is where hotel guests eat breakfast. OSO Ristorante, while not part of the actual hotel, is a haute Italian-leaning venue on the tower\u2019s 27th floor. Along with nice sharing plates of cheese and salumi (and caviar, if it\u2019s your thing), there\u2019s an extensive entr\u00e9e menu that\u2019s very carnivore-friendly.\n\nGym: Yes \u2014 like the rooms, compact and not complicated, but with what you need: treadmills, ellipticals, weights and room for stretching. Weekly yoga classes are complimentary (though first come, first served).\n\nSpa: None, but staff can recommend local day spas for treatments.\n\nRates: Double, from S$284 (about \u00a3170).\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nTell us about your favourite place to stay in Singapore in the comments\n\nFollow FT Globetrotter on Instagram at @FTGlobetrotter", "tag": "singapore?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/23dec305-a95f-4257-8684-021d57dde6c7"}, {"uuid4": "19e41d2f-afef-4bf7-997d-1281d720c975", "title": "A pledge worth paying attention to ", "description": "Also in today\u2019s newsletter: insurers\u2019 new blueprint for their role in the energy transition", "author": "Simon Mundy", "published_date": "2023-01-20T12:00:11.437Z", "content": "On a busy penultimate day at Davos yesterday, Greta Thunberg and her fellow activists didn\u2019t disappoint. Returning to the Swiss town after three years, Thunberg delivered a blistering attack on the World Economic Forum\u2019s claim to be building a better world for all, as she cast the assembled corporate elite as a key driver of the climate emergency. \u201cThe people who we really should be listening to are not here,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead we are bombarded with messages from\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the people who are\u2009causing this crisis.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to argue with that. Still, for journalists covering the drive for a more sustainable world economy, this week has been a useful opportunity to gain insights from meetings with figures from around the world. We\u2019ll be back on Monday with a final round-up of our main takeaways.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, Gillian highlights a possible shift in the shape of philanthropy in Asia. And Kenza updates us on the insurance sector\u2019s continued struggles to grasp the climate nettle. Have a good weekend. (Simon Mundy)\n\nDavos devotees often argue that the main benefit of the event is that it fosters partnerships. This week, one small sign of such a partnership emerged in relation to Asia: Temasek Trust, the philanthropic arm of Singapore\u2019s Temasek sovereign wealth fund, announced its backing for the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cGiving to Amplify Earth Action Initiative\u201d to fight climate\u00a0change.\n\nIt\u2019s true that there are a lot of pious pledges floating in the Davos air. But this one in particular is a striking straw in the wind of a bigger shift. While the region has billions of dollars of philanthropic capital in the hands of rich families, this has hitherto been used primarily to support domestic issues, in a fairly ad hoc, fragmented way, with little channelled to climate change.\n\nBut what Temasek Trust is trying to do is position itself \u2014 and Singapore \u2014 as a hub for this philanthropy to create a more co-ordinated initiative for environmental action. The trust has already got the backing of some western charities, such as the Gates Foundation, and big individual donors such as Ray Dalio. And it\u2019s now trying to gain further support from Asia\u2019s richest families.\n\nIf this gains momentum, Temasek Trust hopes to use its money and expertise to not only design and lead projects, but also \u2014 perhaps most crucially \u2014 develop blended finance initiatives, using philanthropy to underwrite some of the risks of private sector investments in climate infrastructure in the region.\n\nWill it work? This is still unclear. But Temasek starts with a big advantage: it has deep (ish) pockets, a strong record of efficiency \u2014 and Singapore is arguably the most neutral hub\u00a0in Asia. Moreover, as Asia rises in financial power on the\u00a0world stage, there is a growing desire to get more involved in climate change diplomacy. And the younger generations of Asia\u2019s rich families stand to inherit vast sums in the coming years, and often have a strong desire to get involved in the fight. (Gillian Tett)\n\nAxa, Allianz, Swiss Re and other major insurers laid out an industry blueprint for climate goals at Davos this week, detailing the role they intend to play in the energy transition.\n\nWhether clean or dirty, infrastructure and energy projects must obtain insurance cover before they can get credit from banks, thrusting the operations of insurers, reinsurers and brokers into the spotlight.\n\nThe Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), a climate-focused industry club whose members\u2019 portfolios account for 15 per cent of global premiums, has given insurers until July 2024 to choose at least three climate targets to report against annually.\n\nAmong their options: expanding the number of clients who have set science-based net zero goals; doing more underwriting business for weather-related damage, carbon removal technologies or clean energy; and moving away from the most polluting clients.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum by video link on Tuesday, former Bank of England governor Mark Carney described the target-setting guidelines as \u201ca hugely important step on the industry\u2019s journey towards net zero, but also the world\u2019s move to that same objective\u201d.\n\nCarney said insurers served as \u201csociety\u2019s early warning system\u201d, and were on the \u201cfront lines\u201d of climate change, given the annual disaster-related losses exceeding $100bn that they have had to cover in recent years.\n\nThe NZIA has been plagued with fears that collective action to boycott certain industries could amount to a breach of competition law, and resisted pressure last year to recommend its members stop insuring all new coal projects, citing competition law risks.\n\nIt has, to a large extent, been playing catch-up with other groupings in the umbrella body Carney founded, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Banking and asset owners issued their own target-setting guidelines in 2021 or earlier.\n\nActivists argue that what insurers have now come up with amounts to a \u201cfrustrating step backwards\u201d, for three geeky reasons.\n\nFirstly, one of the decarbonisation targets insurers can choose from calls for them to cut emissions such as carbon and methane by at least 34 per cent by 2030 \u2014 notably lower than the minimum 43 per cent cut that the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said is aligned with the Paris agreement.\n\nSecondly, certain important types of insurance, such as construction risk, which would be needed to build oil and gas plants, are out of scope.\n\nFinally, targets do not have to include the scope 3 emissions of insurers\u2019 clients \u2014 emissions related to their supply chains and the use of products \u2014 for many companies, the biggest part of their carbon footprint. This appears to be at odds with a UN standard laid out at COP27 for the integrity of net zero targets, as well as the UN\u2019s Race to Zero campaign. Both stipulate carbon accounting should include mandatory disclosure of indirect emissions.\n\nThe targets follow a first attempt at drawing up global carbon accounting rules for insurers by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) at the end of last year. Its insurance industry members now have until the end of 2025 to publish a breakdown of their clients\u2019 direct emissions \u2014 also omitting scope 3.\n\nPerhaps because it is an accounting body with a boring name, PCAF has been more successful at attracting members from the US, such as Liberty Mutual and MassMutual. Currently, the NZIA\u2019s only North American member is Fidelis Insurance, based in Bermuda. It says a priority for the coming year is to expand further into that region.

US-China tensions remain high, financial markets are skittish, the risk of global recession looms heavily: it is the perfect time to put down an $80,000 deposit on a hot pink Phantom.\n\nThe number of Rolls-Royce cars registered in Singapore surged in 2021 and remained at record levels in 2022 \u2014 waiting lists for the cars now stretch into years. One type of buyer dominates. For the cars that leave the forecourt, a predictable future in the city-state awaits \u2014 shuttling the short routes between the mansions and apartments of Sentosa and other pockets of extreme wealth to luxury shopping malls, the discreet offices of their family funds and the private clubs of Orchard. According to employees at the showroom, the new buyers are overwhelmingly Chinese.\n\nThe flows are part of a transformation of Singapore that is becoming a proxy for the way in which one segment of China is dealing with geopolitical tension and decoupling.\n\nChinese individuals, their families, their companies and their advisers, according to a wide range of bankers, lawyers, accountants and investors interviewed by the Financial Times, now see Singapore as the vessel that can navigate them through a series of expected storms. At the same time, they add, it is becoming an increasingly vital place for outposts of Wall Street and the global financial industry to interact with them. For many years, Singapore has liked to sell itself as the Switzerland of Asia. The new cold war, says one former top official, is finally turning that pitch into a reality. The big question, though, is how far Singapore will tolerate being Switzerland with Chinese characteristics.\n\n\u201cThis is a dramatic, epochal realignment of wealth in Asia. Capital moves as quickly as it can to the safest destinations with the highest rate of return. In Asia, that place is increasingly Singapore,\u201d says Drew Thompson, visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.\n\nThe change on the ground in Singapore is palpable. Property deals by mainland buyers are the dominant transaction and the international schools are bursting at the seams, with hundreds of Chinese applicants for a vanishingly small number of places. Chinese Michelin-starred restaurants might \u2014 just \u2014 be able to find diners an available dinner booking next April.\n\nSingapore\u2019s status as an Asian financial hub has been doubly enhanced by the Chinese influx. The number of Chinese family funds in Singapore has soared from a handful a few years ago to an estimated 600 today. At the same time, some 500 Chinese businesses have registered in the city in the past year, preparing to use their Singapore-based status to venture more boldly into India and other jurisdictions where they face obstacles.\n\nThere is exponentially more business for private wealth managers and other financial services and, as the scale of activity has grown, it has made sense for many of the largest US, European and Japanese investment banks to shift more of their senior staff to Singapore from Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cI think many mainland China clients still see Singapore as a safer long-term bet than Hong Kong for a few reasons. First is political stability, second is economic stability and finally, its rising status as Asia\u2019s financial hub,\u201d says Kia Meng Loh, co-head of private wealth and family office practices at Dentons Rodyk, a law firm.\n\nBut for all the signals that Singapore has found itself in a prime position to thrive amid geopolitical uncertainty, the story has distinct vulnerabilities. China\u2019s tolerance of what has been happening \u2014 the exodus of capital and individuals \u2014 will eventually have a breaking point that may come with consequences.\n\nSingaporean society could also push back, warn senior figures close to its government. The cost of living has soared in Singapore, angering locals who see danger and division in the rising rents, the bursting schools and the growing number of Rolls-Royces. Meanwhile, the inflow of so much capital so quickly also exposes Singapore to the potential for bad actors using it as a spot to hide money.\n\n\u201cCapital is always moving. And it, and the people controlling it, can just as easily flow back out,\u201d says one investment banker based in the city.\n\nSingapore has been a hub for Chinese migration and capital since it was first declared a freeport by Sir Stamford Raffles in the 19th century. Roughly three-quarters of Singapore\u2019s 3.5mn citizens are ethnically Chinese, making it culturally an easy fit for the newest arrivals.\n\n\u201cChinese money has always had a significant role to play in Singapore\u2019s economy, even before Singapore became the Singapore we know today,\u201d says Yinglan Tan, head of Insignia Ventures, a Singapore-based venture capital fund with many Chinese backers.\n\nThat appeal has grown during the pandemic. As China sealed itself off from the world, employed harsh lockdown measures and cracked down on wealth as part of a \u201ccommon prosperity drive\u201d, some in mainland China looked overseas.\n\nAs many parts of the world, particularly the west, have become more wary of Chinese investment and business, Singapore\u2019s neutrality, stability, low taxes and low corruption makes it an obvious choice.\n\nInvestment migration consultancy Henley & Partners has had a significant spike in migration inquiries from Chinese nationals in 2022, which are up 83 per cent by end of November compared to the full year 2021. In the top two positions were Greece and Portugal, which offer \u201cgolden visas\u201d that grant residence without having to spend time there. Singapore was in third place.\n\n\u201cGenerally in pure investment migration programmes, such as Portugal, the vast majority of people don\u2019t move. Singapore and China are different. A lot do want to move physically,\u201d says Dominic Volek, head of private clients at Henley & Partners.\n\nOne of the most obvious areas where this flow of Chinese capital can be seen is in family offices, the private wealth management firms set up for rich individuals and their relatives. If they are domiciled in Singapore, family offices qualify for tax exemptions. Coupled with the city\u2019s stability and a globally respected financial regulator, the number of funds has exploded. Approvals are taking months as the Monetary Authority of Singapore grapples with the surge.\n\nSingapore has gone from some 50 family offices in 2018 to 700 by the end of 2021 and lawyers and wealth management advisers estimate that number reached about 1,500 by the end of 2022. IQ-EQ, an investor services firm, estimates about 40 per cent of that total are mainland Chinese.\n\nWang Jue, a 35-year-old from Chengdu in China, represents one of many of the Chinese entrepreneurs venturing overseas and choosing Singapore as a business base.\n\nWang says he shifted more assets from his Hong Kong family office to a new Singapore family office set up in 2021. The art collector and investor, who lives in China but visits Singapore frequently and owns property in the city, has more than 300 pieces from Czech artist Alphonse Mucha that he wants to set up for viewing in the metaverse.\n\n\u201cSingapore is a choice globally, not just Chinese,\u201d he says over a Zoom interview, with work by US artist KAWS, Japanese painter Yayoi Kusama and a Ming dynasty antique in the background. \u201cThe politics are stable, the economy is stable and finally, it is a finance centre so capital can flow easily in and out.\u201d Singapore has not had to confront the sort of mass street protests that were seen in Hong Kong, he says.\n\nMany of those family offices go on to set up other types of structures such as offshore funds. The number of investment funds launched as part of a 2020 government scheme designed to lure money from rival low-tax jurisdictions has surged to 776 at the end of 2022 (from 470 at the end of 2021), according to figures from Singapore\u2019s accounting authority. Called a Variable Capital Company (VCC), the vehicle is meant to attract those who traditionally looked to jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands to house assets.\n\nCaroline Lee, who advises Chinese clients with a family office in Singapore, agrees with Volek of Henley & Partners that Chinese are increasingly looking to move physically to Singapore. Opening a family office opens the door to getting a visa to live and work in Singapore, she says. \u201cMany travel to and fro. They see Singapore as cosmopolitan. They can speak Chinese or English and it is easy to adapt.\u201d\n\nOne of the key attractions is Singapore\u2019s education system, seen as one of the best in the world. The vice-principal at one of the city\u2019s large international schools says anecdotally that of the last 20 families accepted at the school half had been from China.\n\n\u201cOften we do not even deal with the parents. We deal with the manager and what they call the \u2018communicator\u2019 \u2014 basically a translator,\u201d the vice-principal says, speaking anonymously because of sensitivities involved. \u201cOften one or both parents are travelling in and out of China. They pay a fortune to buy or rent a luxury unit nearby and then the kids live with the maid, the manager and the communicator.\u201d\n\nThis is borne out in real estate data, which show two strong years of property purchases in Singapore by mainland Chinese. According to government data, Chinese citizens bought 1,738 flats in 2021, which was 50 per cent higher than in 2019 and the most since 2012. Purchases were slightly lower, but still a historically high 1,314 units in 2022.\n\nPrivate residential property rents hit a record high in 2022, surpassing the previous peak in 2013, according to Urban Redevelopment Authority data \u2014 the last time Chinese mainlanders were heavily buying Singaporean residential property.\n\n\u201cWhat our agents are telling me is that they are expecting more sales with the reopening of China,\u201d says Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research from OrangeTee & Tie, a property research consultancy. \u201cThis past year a large portion have been luxury buyers. Once China relaxes we are expecting more buyers in even suburban areas.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of mainland buyers that have become Singapore citizens or permanent residents are buying units in bulk,\u201d she adds. Singaporeans and permanent residents avoid higher stamp duty fees on property purchases \u2014 the tax for foreign buyers was lifted from 20 to 30 per cent in 2021 to cool the market.\n\nAll of this together has put Singapore in an enviable position globally as an international wealth hub. A record S$448bn ($339bn) in asset management inflows was recorded in 2021, 15.7 per cent higher than the previous year, the latest data from the Monetary Authority of Singapore show. By comparison, net fund inflows in Hong Kong for asset management for 2021 was HK$1.514tn ($194bn), compared with HK$1.379tn in 2020, according to the city\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission.\n\nThat realignment of wealth has brought tantalisingly closer the city\u2019s long-held ambition of being a deeper and self-sustaining financial hub.\n\n\u201cThe thing that Covid did for Singapore was that prior to the crisis it really struggled to have that community of finance professionals to the extent that it became self-sustained. Now the flow is here. The decision makers are here. Walking distance from my office I can meet lawyers, asset managers, portfolio managers, someone running a family office, someone wealthy wanting to set up a family office. Prior to the pandemic it wasn\u2019t as deep,\u201d says Michael Marquardt, Asia chief executive of IQ-EQ, an investor services firm that sets up family offices.\n\nAt a time of intense geopolitical rivalry between the west and China, Singapore remains open and welcoming of both.\n\n\u201cYou can be Chinese, come here and eat Chinese and do business and have a network. If you are from New York, you can come here, eat your food, do business and have a network,\u201d Marquardt adds.\n\nSingapore has also stolen important conferences from under Hong Kong\u2019s nose. SuperReturn Asia, Asia\u2019s leading private capital conference, last year was held in Singapore for the first time and attracted large companies and investors from all over the world, including China.\n\n\u201cWhen Singapore wants something, the whole machine gets behind it. Singapore Venture Capital Association co-hosted [the event], Singapore Tourism Board provided sponsorship, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and other agencies provided content, the sovereign [investors] were supportive and spread the word,\u201d says Shane Chesson, a founding partner of Singapore\u2019s Openspace Ventures who was involved in moving the conference location.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve played a blinder but they also move quickly and don\u2019t squander the opportunity,\u201d he adds.\n\nStill, many in Singapore hesitate to say the shift is permanent. If rich Chinese feel that the current level of repression is lessening, that could reduce the number of people seeking an exit. But even more worrying, say experts, is the potential for Beijing to look at Singapore\u2019s welcome to China\u2019s wealthy and their accompanying flows of capital and seeing it as an opportunity to extend its influence.\n\n\u201cYou run the risk of China being covetous of Singapore as a Chinese outpost. The more Sinicised and mainland it becomes, the more it could be seen as a part of greater China,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cIt is an existential risk.\u201d\n\nThe other issue Singapore\u2019s ruling party is grappling with is the impact on the city\u2019s carefully managed societal mix. The government for instance sets ethnic quotas in public housing \u2014 where about 80 per cent of Singaporeans live \u2014 as a way of trying to ensure racial and religious harmony.\n\nCracks are emerging. The conversations among wealthy \u2014 and aspiring wealthy \u2014 Singaporeans and other parts of its establishment regularly turn to complaints about the new Chinese nationals building \u201cenclaves\u201d or \u201cmini Chinatowns\u201d in certain neighbourhoods.\n\nBut the clearest indication of unhappiness among the local population is the cost of living, and especially rising rents. According to data from the URA, rents for private homes surged 8.6 per cent in the third quarter, which was the steepest growth since 2007. Rents for private apartments, dominated by foreigners and expats, and government-subsidised housing, where most citizens live, are soaring.\n\n\u201cThe government was quite happy for people to blame Hong Kong expats. But it has become pretty clear that while that was a contributing factor, the real reason for the eye-popping prices has been the Chinese buyers, many of whom are willing to pay double the asking rent, or pay millions in cash for properties that sit empty,\u201d says one real estate agent.\n\nThere is a concern that at some point the Singapore authorities will face ever louder complaints from the middle class, and, potentially, from the thousands of foreign professionals living and working there. If the quality of life changes, a lot of that wealthy capital might move on, experts warn.\n\nIn this respect, Hong Kong\u2019s swift transformation under a new national security law and its loss of business and people due to Covid restrictions offers a cautionary tale for Singapore on how quickly a city\u2019s fortunes can change.\n\nSingapore, sums up Simon Tay, chair of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, is in a sweet spot as globalisation slows.\n\n\u201cIn a world where China is looking for friends, it gets a warm reception in Singapore. At the same time, Wall Street and US companies increasingly see us as a premium alternative to other hubs,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere is much to navigate and all depends on not having to make a choice [between the west and China], because that would force Singapore to destroy value. Cold wars are all about value destruction.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/62845c24-1e45-483c-95d1-b2c5d4c07337"}, {"uuid4": "e69e9736-b58e-4eb0-a829-f7d54f26bb82", "title": "Ratan Tata, leading Indian businessman, 1937-2024 ", "description": "Industrialist who led the Tata conglomerate\u2019s acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover and UK steel plants, with mixed results", "author": "Chloe Cornish", "published_date": "2024-10-09T19:51:31.865Z", "content": "Ratan Tata, who was one of India\u2019s best known businesspeople and led his family conglomerate on a bold international expansion, has died aged 86.\n\nAn industrialist from an influential Zoroastrian Parsee clan, Tata wanted his family\u2019s storied corporate group to wield clout beyond the nation it helped to build \u2014 but found its execution did not always match his grand vision.\n\nBorn in Mumbai (then Bombay) in 1937, Tata\u2019s life spanned a period of enormous change for India \u2014 from winning independence from Britain in 1947 to becoming the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy in 2022.\n\nTata was \u201can uncommon leader whose immeasurable contributions have shaped not only the Tata Group but also the very fabric of our nation\u201d, said Natarajan Chandrasekaran, current chair of the group holding company, in a statement.\n\nAttending prestigious prep schools in Mumbai and graduating from New York state\u2019s Cornell University in\u00a0architecture studies, Tata first worked in Los Angeles, where he said he \u201cfell in love and almost got married\u201d.\n\nBut the relationship disintegrated after he returned to Mumbai to spend time with his ailing grandmother \u2014 a stabilising presence in his childhood after his parents\u2019 divorce \u2014 and the 1962 war between India and China deterred his would-be partner from joining him.\n\nTata worked on the steel shop floor of the family business, which was founded by his great-grandfather in 1868, before moving into management. In 1991, he took over as chair from\u00a0his uncle, JRD Tata. His accession coincided with India\u2019s economic opening to the world, and under his leadership the group ventured abroad.\n\nIt began by buying British tea maker Tetley Tea in 2000. By 2007, Tata had completed a takeover of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, which eventually cost $13bn and left it owning a clutch of UK factories. The timing, just before the global financial crisis, was disastrous. Tata later said the UK plants were\u00a0\u201cunderinvested and overmanned\u201d.\n\nThe group announced it wanted\u00a0to divest in 2016 and this September closed its blast furnaces at the UK\u2019s biggest steelworks in Port Talbot. Under a deal with the UK government, it plans to develop greener forms of steelmaking at the plant.\n\nIn March 2008, Tata bought British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover from Ford for $2.3bn. In just two years, the Indian group founded under British colonial rule had become the UK\u2019s biggest manufacturing employer. Critics who decried the deal as value-destructive were briefly silenced when JLR contributed strongly to Tata Motors profits\u00a0three years later, but JLR has since had a\u00a0chequered record.\n\nTata\u2019s pet projects included the Tata Nano, an ultra-cheap car marketed at Rs100,000, then worth $2,600, to help bring millions more middle-class Indians to the automotive market. But sales of the Nano were dismal and Tata Motors took years to recover from its costly failure. \u201cI\u2019m very depressed,\u201d\u00a0Tata said\u00a0of the Nano\u2019s flop.\n\nMore recently, as group chair emeritus, Tata enthusiastically supported the reacquisition of national carrier Air India, which was founded by JRD Tata but nationalised in 1953, in a deal that valued the struggling airline at $2.4bn. In a tweet welcoming Air India back into the family fold, Tata said his uncle \u201cwould have been overjoyed\u201d.\n\nTata had cultivated a reputation for straight-dealing, and despite an enthusiasm for private aircraft and flashy sports cars, presented a modest lifestyle relative to the ostentatious spending of fellow Indian tycoons. He was revered in Mumbai as India Inc\u2019s elder statesman, and praised for his humility.\n\nIn 2014, Britain awarded Tata an honorary knighthood for his contribution to relations with India, investment in the UK and philanthropy. But his genteel personal brand was damaged by a bitter dispute with Cyrus Mistry, his successor as group chair.\n\nMistry was a fellow member of the tight-knit business community of Parsees \u2014 descendants of Persian Zoroastrians who migrated to the subcontinent between the eighth and 10th centuries. He was abruptly ousted in a boardroom coup in 2016.\n\nMistry accused Tata of a catalogue of governance failures including having abused his position as chair of the Tata Trusts, a philanthropic trust that owns the majority stake in Tata Group holding company Tata Sons.\u00a0Mistry claimed Tata had interfered in the running of Tata Sons, an allegation he denied.\n\nIn a drawn-out legal and media battle that sullied the group\u2019s reputation, the family patriarch was ultimately the winner, vindicated by a Supreme Court ruling in 2021. Bad blood remained between the conjoined houses of Tata and Mistry \u2014 the latter still owns 18 per cent of Tata Sons \u2014 and Ratan Tata did not offer any public condolence when Mistry died in a car accident in 2022, aged 54.\n\nAn animal lover who famously ordered that stray dogs be allowed to lounge in the lobby of the Tata headquarters in Mumbai, Tata never married and had no children.\n\n\u201cIf I had a family, I could not have spent as much of my time involved with the group. And, things would be very different, in terms of eating, sleeping, living for your job,\u201d he told the FT just before his 2012 retirement as group chair.\n\nWhile the overseas expansion he led was at times messy, it created what is now one of India\u2019s most outward-looking and modern corporate forces.\n\nChandrasekaran, the group\u2019s current chair and the first not related to the founder by family or marriage, has said he had to \u201cstop the bleeding\u201d at its debt-laden companies. But Tata is now at the forefront of business in India across a range of sectors from electric vehicles to renewable energy.\n\nMukesh Ambani, head of the rival conglomerate Reliance Industries, said Tata\u2019s death was \u201ca big loss, not just to the Tata Group, but to every Indian\u201d. \u201cRatan Tata was a visionary industrialist and a philanthropist, who always strove for society\u2019s greater good,\u201d Ambani said.\n\n\u201cI would hope that people would say that I was able to lead the group with dignity and that I tried to do the right thing,\u201d Tata said in 2012 of his legacy. \u201cYou never succeed, having that said, because you always have upset somebody or another, but I think that\u2019s what I would like to be remembered for.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5a405ffe-e9ef-4ebf-9203-ce2283f6d203"}, {"uuid4": "5ae743b9-3138-425b-a912-04ee57563236", "title": "India denounces \u2018stifling\u2019 EU carbon tax on imports", "description": "Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman says tariffs to be imposed in 2026 will impede energy transition ", "author": "Stephanie Findlay", "published_date": "2024-10-09T13:14:58.058Z", "content": "India\u2019s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has denounced the EU\u2019s planned carbon tax on imports as an arbitrary \u201ctrade barrier\u201d that will hurt the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy and other industrialising nations.\n\nSitharaman said the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), under which tariffs are to be levied from 2026, would impede developing countries\u2019 transition away from fossil fuels by making the change harder to fund.\n\n\u201cThey are unilateral and are not helpful,\u201d Sitharaman told the Financial Times\u2019 Energy Transition Summit India in New Delhi. \u201cAbsolutely, it is a trade barrier.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are being stifled by steps which are not going to facilitate the green transition,\u201d she added.\n\nThe CBAM is intended to penalise embedded carbon emissions from the production of goods imported to the EU such as cement, fertilisers, iron and steel, and chemicals. The tax, which was approved last year, has triggered alarm among India\u2019s fast-growing heavy industries, which fear it could wipe out one of their biggest markets.\n\nA report by the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment estimated the CBAM would result in an additional 25 per cent tax on carbon-intensive goods exported from India to the EU, a burden that at 2022-23 levels would be equivalent to 0.05 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP.\n\nIndia relies on coal for more than half of its electricity generation and to directly power much of its production of goods, such as steel.\n\nNew Delhi has also been riled by a controversial EU anti-deforestation law that will block foreign companies from exporting to the bloc if their products are deemed to have contributed to forest loss.\n\nAfter widespread international criticism of the deforestation law, which was meant to enter into force in December, Brussels last week proposed a one-year delay to its implementation.\n\nSitharaman said India was on track to be a net zero carbon emitter by 2070, barring \u201cunilateral\u201d external challenges, such as the EU carbon tariff and deforestation initiatives.\n\n\u201cThat is another one of those steps which can hurt countries like India,\u201d she said of the deforestation rules. \u201cYou will have major disruptions in the supply chain, that\u2019s not going to help countries spending a lot on transition costs.\u201d\n\nUnder the CBAM, exporters to the EU must register the emissions produced in creating their products, with charges kicking in from 2026. The EU is confident the measure would survive a possible challenge at the World Trade Organization because it applies to domestic producers as well as imports.\n\nSitharaman said India had raised concerns with the EU \u201cseveral times\u201d and would do so again, but that she did not expect the issue to affect ongoing free trade negotiations with the bloc.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be escalated to the level of hurting the talks,\u201d the finance minister added. \u201cBut our concerns will definitely be voiced.\u201d\n\nIgnacio Garcia Bercero, non-resident fellow at the Breugel think-tank in Brussels, said the EU measures were being taken to meet the global challenge of climate change and damage to nature, not for protectionist reasons.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to meet internationally agreed global goals to stop deforestation unless importing countries contribute. Europe does not produce most of these commodities so it is not protectionist,\u201d he said.\n\nOn CBAM, Bercero said the EU\u2019s heavy industry was paying more for emissions and without the tariff would simply be forced out of business by cheaper imports from countries without a carbon tax.\n\nNgozi Okonjo-Iweala, the WTO director-general, told the FT last month that global carbon pricing was necessary, but that poorer countries should pay less.", "tag": "india?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/40648adc-b621-41a3-958a-dd038c811986"}, {"uuid4": "218c4a22-b472-42e4-98a3-fab84e0bdbf6", "title": "The battle to build India\u2019s military jet engines", "description": "New Delhi will soon recruit a western partner to produce its first world-class jet engine. The decision will be fraught with geopolitical implications", "author": "Sylvia Pfeifer", "published_date": "2024-10-09T12:35:12.903Z", "content": "In the 1990s, when India was pursuing economic reforms, testing nuclear weapons and raising its profile internationally, its defence establishment began work on a homegrown military jet engine: the Kaveri, named after a river in the country\u2019s south.\n\nFor a nation where self-reliance in industry is a mantra of both Narendra Modi\u2019s government and those that preceded it, the ability to develop and build such powerful technology on its own soil \u2014 referred to in India as an \u201cindigenous\u201d product \u2014 is one of its biggest dreams.\n\nBut producing advanced fighter jet engines is a complex process and the knowledge to make them requires real-world experience built up over decades. Only five countries \u2014 notably the current permanent members of the UN Security Council \u2014 know how to build them: the US, UK, France, Russia and China. Beijing, however, is just moving from a reliance on imported equipment from Russia and only recently test flew a fighter jet with a supposedly homegrown engine.\n\nIndia was eager to join the elite club. But despite years of research, prototyping and testing, the Kaveri flopped. India had failed to produce an engine with sufficient thrust to power its current generation of Tejas light combat aircraft. Instead, it plans to use a version of the Kaveri in future unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones.\n\nYet India\u2019s mission to build an \u201cindigenous\u201d military jet engine is back on. What it learned from its work on the Kaveri, not least its mistakes, may yet bear fruit. According to Indian defence industry officials, foreign diplomats and analysts, the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy is in an advanced stage of deliberations on producing its first world-class \u201cMade in India\u201d jet engine, working with a western partner that is yet to be decided.\n\nWhile the foreign partner would bring its technological experience, the engine would be wholly developed and built in India \u2014 making it the first truly \u201cindigenous\u201d product of its kind. Once complete, the engine would be fitted into India\u2019s new suite of fifth-generation advanced fighter aircraft due to be airborne by the mid-2030s.\n\nA behind-the-scenes battle is now heating up, involving lobbying, horse-trading, and pledges about future ownership of intellectual property, to become the aerospace partner of choice for the world\u2019s most populous country.\n\nJostling for the lucrative contract to help India fulfil its ambitions are three key players: General Electric of the US, the UK\u2019s Rolls-Royce, and French group Safran. France and the US are already India\u2019s second and third-biggest defence suppliers after Russia, whose aircraft and other military equipment India is diversifying away from.\n\nWhich partner New Delhi chooses would be freighted with geopolitical implications. It comes at a time when India\u2019s international ambitions are rising, its military rivalry with China is deepening, its relationship with the US is expanding and the Modi government is aspiring to join the world\u2019s top tables, including the UN Security Council.\n\nOn the table for the three companies \u2014 and the governments backing them \u2014 is a decades-long partnership across both defence and civil industries with a fast-growing economy, one that will depend on imported knowhow and kit for years to come.\n\n\u201cPart of the attraction is simply one of scale,\u201d says Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cIndia will over time require considerable numbers of aircraft as the air force looks to recapitalise combat aircraft fleets.\u201d\n\nIndia, says Philippe Errera, executive vice-president of international and public affairs at Safran, is \u201chugely important\u201d for the group, \u201cbased on the present and looking into the future\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis goes beyond military jet engines, to include defence more broadly but also commercial engines,\u201d he adds.\n\nLast year, India managed to land an uncrewed spacecraft near the Moon\u2019s south pole. But despite years of trying, it has yet to develop a viable, advanced military jet engine.\n\nDeveloping an engine large and powerful enough for a civil jet is already extremely complex, analysts say. It relies on knowledge built up over decades, including which materials to use and why and on how to integrate the different parts.\n\nA military jet engine that is capable of delivering world-class performance on a consistent basis brings with it an extra set of challenges, given the higher speeds and tolerances involved. This helps explain why more countries have nuclear weapons capability than the technology needed to keep a fighter jet in the air.\n\nWhile large civil engines need to maximise fuel efficiency, military jet engines are about the amount of power an engine can produce in relation to weight of the aircraft, analysts say. \u201cNo other form of power apart from nuclear comes close to the level of power density you get in a gas turbine,\u201d says one industry expert, who asked not be named because of the sensitivities around discussing large military deals.\n\nCivil airliners fly predictable route patterns and spend much of their time at cruising altitude; military jets have to fly at much higher speeds and with the ability to accelerate quickly. This means, for example, that the bearings in the gas turbine have to be developed to withstand greater tolerances. The engines also use afterburners, which provide a short burst of increased thrust by igniting additional fuel in its exhaust stream.\n\nComplicating things further, most fifth-generation fighters \u2014 like the one being mooted by India \u2014 will have their engines embedded within the aircraft frame to minimise their radar and infrared signatures to help avoid detection. All these complexities extend the development and certification programme for military engines.\n\n\u201cIndia has a technology bottleneck which it has to pass through with gas turbines,\u201d says Prasobh Narayanan, a senior aviation analyst at Janes in Bengaluru. \u201cIt is not able to crack that bottleneck on its own, and needs help.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s efforts to develop the Kaveri in the 1990s came at a time of acute strategic challenges, after the Soviet Union \u2014 its biggest military supplier \u2014 collapsed. New Delhi was also at loggerheads with Washington over its nuclear weapons programme, and began developing military ties with alternative suppliers such as France.\n\nThe situation today is far different. India has reconciled with the US and over the past two years the two nations have expanded co-operation in defence and technology. This partially reflects a shift in India\u2019s threat perception; it now sees China, and not its neighbour and long-standing foe Pakistan, as the bigger danger.\n\nSince Modi took power in 2014, he has stepped up efforts to bring foreign defence groups to India and promote more \u201cindigenous\u201d production in defence, urging private groups such as Tata, Adani and Mahindra to begin making defence products ranging from personnel carriers to drones.\n\nHowever, the entry of these Indian conglomerates to the defence market over the past decade have failed to make up for the failings of its state-owned groups, led by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), India\u2019s biggest aerospace producer. India\u2019s Defence Research and Development Organisation and HAL are set to be the Indian partner in developing the new jet engine. HAL and India\u2019s ministry of defence did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIndia abandoned plans for a \u201cMake in India\u201d project to produce French Rafale jets locally, opting instead to buy 36 imported jets in 2016. Today India also remains its biggest defence importer \u2014 not a point of pride for a country that aspires to boost its own industrial exports and create desperately needed jobs. China is going to be \u201cincreasingly active in the combat aircraft export market and with its own rather than Russian-sourced engines\u201d, says Barrie of the IISS. But he believes Beijing is unlikely to compete in traditional western markets.\n\nThe world\u2019s large aero-engine makers have been active in India for decades, forging partnerships with domestic contractors and setting up local manufacturing. Engines by Rolls-Royce powered the first flight of the Indian Air Force in 1933, while Safran is the leading supplier of turbine engines for the country\u2019s military helicopters.\n\nAfter the Kaveri engine failed to meet performance criteria, HAL turned to GE engines, and uses the US producer\u2019s F404 models in its first-generation Mk1 fighters.\n\nDuring Modi\u2019s state visit to Washington last year, GE announced it was ready to supply India with its newer F414 engines for the forthcoming Tejas Mk2. The agreement includes the potential joint production of the F414 engines in India.\n\nGE signalled at the time that it believed that this positioned it well for future work. The US company said it would continue to \u201ccollaborate with the Indian government\u201d on the engine programme for the more advanced fighter.\n\nIndia\u2019s commitment to building its own military jet engine is backed by significant funding. In March, its Cabinet Committee on Security approved funding worth $1.8bn for the manufacturing, testing and certifying of five prototypes for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft programme over the next five years.\n\nIndian officials have spoken of inducting the planned jet into the Indian Air Force by the early to mid-2030s, leading to speculation among defence analysts in the country that it will soon decide who its partner on the \u201cindigenous\u201d jet engine will be.\n\nRolls-Royce and Safran each insist that they are ready to work with HAL, the state-owned aerospace firm, to co-develop a bespoke engine that would entail a full transfer of intellectual property to India, including the right to include it in future exports.\n\nBritain\u2019s Rolls-Royce has emphasised its long history in India, which stretches back more than 90 years and involves multiple partnerships across its divisions.\n\n\u201cWhat we are talking about is a gear change,\u201d says Alex Zino, director of future programmes for Rolls-Royce\u2019s defence division. \u201cNow is the time to co-create that IP and that capability in-country, so that it is owned in-country.\u201d\n\nIndia, Zino says, would have the freedom to operate, upgrade or modify the co-developed engine, should they partner. Rolls-Royce has been working on its proposal \u201cthrough and with the UK government\u201d, he confirms.\n\nSafran, too, is promising India similar freedoms to own any engine technology it and HAL co-develop. The French company\u2019s proposal would give India \u201cstrategic independence in terms of empowering the country to design, develop and produce state of the art military jet engines domestically and export them\u201d, says Errera, the Safran executive.\n\nGE\u2019s offer, by contrast, would withhold a small portion of the IP on any future co-developed jet engine, according to two people familiar with its plans. \u201cSome things the US, from a national security perspective, might want to retain,\u201d says one of the people. GE declined to comment.\n\nSome US officials remain wary of India\u2019s continued close relationship with Russia, analysts say, meaning Washington and GE might be less willing to part ways with coveted technology in its entirety. Although India and the US are co-operating more closely than ever, including on defence, New Delhi retains ties and trading relationships with not only Moscow but other governments, such as Tehran, that are inimical to Washington.\n\nWorking in GE\u2019s favour, however, is geopolitics and India\u2019s deepening relationship with the US \u2014 part of a joint strategy to build an \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d bulwark against China. India is already deploying multiple US defence platforms, including helicopters, howitzers, and mobility aircraft, and is in the process of agreeing a major contract for long-endurance UAVs with General Atomics.\n\n\u201cI think the American offer is the most serious one,\u201d says Amit Cowshish, a retired senior civil servant formerly active in India\u2019s defence ministry. \u201cThe Americans could possibly be pushing harder with the kind of clout they have, which is much more than that of any other country.\u201d\n\nFrance has made an appeal based on its own burgeoning relationship with New Delhi. Safran employs just under 3,000 people in India \u2014 a number it says will grow as it expands its operations there. The French group, in which the government holds an 11 per cent share, plans to open a maintenance facility in the aerospace and tech hub of Hyderabad, a city in southern India\u2019s Telangana state, next year. The site will support the Leap engines Safran makes through its CFM International, a joint venture with GE Aerospace, and which power the majority of the Airbus A320 family of commercial jets.\n\n\u201cWe have stood by your side through thick and thin,\u201d Safran\u2019s chair Ross McInnes assured an audience at India\u2019s Defence Conclave earlier this month. \u201cThe same cannot be said of your other western partners,\u201d he added, noting that France was the only western country that stood with India after the uproar over its nuclear tests in 1998.\n\nErrera echoes the point, saying there is \u201cmore predictability and more stability in the relationship\u201d with France than with its rivals. And unlike the US, where Congress needs to sign off on big defence deals, the French government could green light any future co-operation.\n\nIndia\u2019s government and HAL have given no indication of when they will issue the first \u201crequest for information\u201d to potential engine partners.\n\nAlthough India\u2019s state-dominated defence establishment tends to move slowly, and with limited transparency, analysts and officials say New Delhi will need to quicken its pace if it wants to keep up on defence.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t make the decision, soon they will be missing the deadline\u201d for a decision on their engine programme, says Raji Pillai, resident senior fellow with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a Canberra-based think-tank. \u201cIndia\u2019s fighter jet numbers are depleting pretty fast.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f007cf0c-1e00-4ddc-bc3c-59aad46728ea"}, {"uuid4": "6a85460f-1f62-4dbc-9269-dd569ffe6f1c", "title": "India\u2019s belated oil rush", "description": "India hurries to extract oil before the sun sets on the fossil fuel industry", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2024-10-09T04:00:42.472Z", "content": "The head of KPMG US says the industry urgently needs to make it easier to become an accountant, and the EU is suing Hungary\u2019s government over a new security law it says is in breach of citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.

I was with BP a few days earlier. I have had meetings with Chevron [\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.] I went to Brazil and had a discussion with Petrobras,\u201d Hardeep Singh Puri told the Financial Times\u2019 Energy Transition Summit India in Delhi.\n\n\u201cI said you come, join Oil India prospecting off the Andaman waters. Don\u2019t make any investment, just come in. We will incentivise them. And if you strike oil and you are a partner, you will have first right of refusal,\u201d Puri added.\n\nThe minister said India had \u201cseveral\u201d oilfields the size of ExxonMobil\u2019s 11bn barrel discovery in Guyana waiting to be found and that the country needed to move quickly to tap them before the world switched to other forms of energy in order to hit net zero climate targets.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s a race,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it remains there unexploited, when the [energy] transition becomes total, there is a philosophical debate on that. I keep telling Guyana, you got a big find, but by the time the oil starts coming into the market, the transition already would be in a pretty advanced stage.\u201d\n\nThe Indian minister\u2019s remarks appear to signal that Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government intends to make up for lost time in offshore oil exploration and production, where some investment has been deterred by fluctuating regulations and persistent red tape.\n\nEstimates of India\u2019s potential oil wealth differ hugely. S&P Global Commodity Insights believes there may be as much as 22bn barrels of oil in unexplored basins. Rystad, an energy consultancy, puts the figure at just under 8bn.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts at the International Energy Agency are pessimistic about the chances of a significant increase in the country\u2019s 700,000 barrels per day of production.\n\n\u201cIn part, the absence of international companies may be due to lacklustre discoveries since the turn of the century,\u201d they wrote, in their annual Indian Oil Market outlook. Over the past 23 years, 2bn barrels of oil have been discovered in India, compared with 10bn in each of Angola, Norway and Guyana and 40bn in Brazil.\n\n\u201cAgainst the backdrop of capital discipline, major players may be waiting on the sidelines for a world-class find before establishing operations in the country,\u201d they added.\n\nPuri, who promised in July more than $100bn of investment opportunities in the sector by 2030, is trying to reduce India\u2019s overwhelming dependence on imported oil.\n\n\u201cWe just took our eye off the ball. There was neglect,\u201d he said. Only 10 per cent of India\u2019s potentially oil-producing basins were being explored, while the country imported 85 per cent to 88 per cent of its oil and spent $150bn a year on foreign energy resources, Puri said.\n\nTo trigger more oil exploration, he said he would radically change India\u2019s legal framework. \u201cWe sat down with the majors and said: \u2018Look, guys, tell us which are the areas where you want tweaking in policy?\u2019 In the next session [of parliament], which will be fully next month, I will get that bill passed and it will be enacted into law,\u201d he said.\n\nThe proposed legislation reforms regulation of oilfield development to protect companies against sudden windfall taxes and gives them the right to arbitrate any disputes outside India, among other changes.\n\nPuri said India had also opened more than a million square kilometres that were previously \u201cno-go areas\u201d because of military or other restrictions, and had put \u201call the data which people require\u201d on a repository at the University of Texas in Houston.\n\nBP, Reliance and Vedanta were among the companies that submitted bids this year in India\u2019s ninth licensing round, for nine onshore blocks, eight shallow-water blocks and 11 ultra-deepwater blocks. Puri said 38 per cent of the bids were for areas that were previously restricted.\n\nForeign oil companies are hoping India\u2019s status as one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing big economies will underpin future demand for crude. \u201cIndia is growing and looks very, very healthy,\u201d said Darren Woods, chief executive of ExxonMobil, at the company\u2019s last results call.\n\n\u201cIndia is where the real growth is going to come, so it has an underlying advantage,\u201d said Puri.

But in written remarks issued through his office ahead of his arrival in India, Muizzu described India as \u201cour closest neighbour, with whom we share deep historical, cultural and economic ties\u201d.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s proximity and long-standing support have been pivotal in the Maldives\u2019 development and stability,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Maldives\u2019 net or usable foreign exchange reserves fell to about $36mn in September, the country\u2019s monetary authority said on Monday, underscoring the depth of a crisis facing the dollar-pegged rufiyaa currency.\n\nThe swaps would be \u201cinstrumental in tackling the ongoing financial challenges faced by the Maldives\u201d, Modi\u2019s office said after his meeting with Muizzu.\n\nIndia has already rolled over $100mn of short-term dollar loans to the Maldives this year, allowing the country to make an interest payment this month on a $500mn Islamic sukuk that comes due next year.\n\nInvestors had worried that the Maldives would be the first country to default on a sukuk, a form of debt that follows Islamic strictures against interest.\n\nMuizzu this year told India to withdraw its small military contingent from the islands, a force that mostly helped in medical evacuations and maritime surveillance.\n\nMuizzu also alarmed India by paying one of his first foreign visits as president to China \u2014 New Delhi\u2019s biggest regional rival. However, the Maldives and India have since reconciled and civilian personnel have replaced the soldiers.\n\nMuizzu said the Maldives had also \u201ccultivated a robust relationship with China\u201d, which he described as \u201cone of our top development partners\u201d, including through projects under Beijing\u2019s flagship global infrastructure programme, the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nLast month the state-owned State Bank of India agreed to lend $50mn to the Maldives, days before it faced a roughly $25mn coupon payment on the sukuk.\n\n\u201cGiven its ambitions of being a net security provider in the Indian Ocean, India has no way of turning away the Maldives,\u201d said Indrani Bagchi, chief executive of the Ananta Centre, a New Delhi-based think-tank.\n\n\u201cThere has also been a better realisation of the actual role India plays inside the Maldives, including a fairly large humanitarian role \u2014 something which cannot be replicated by any other power,\u201d Bagchi said.\n\nThe Maldives\u2019 foreign exchange reserves fell to critically low levels after its tourism economy was battered by Covid-19 travel restrictions and debt ballooned because of high spending on infrastructure projects and imports.\n\nThe country\u2019s sukuk maturing in 2026 plummeted to trade at 70 cents on the dollar last month over investor fears of a sovereign default. They rose 0.4 per cent to 80 cents on the dollar following Monday\u2019s bailout news.\n\nWary of Chinese influence in its backyard, India has sought to assist regional neighbours suffering economic difficulties.

After downgrading the state, the government blocked the internet there for months and carried out mass arrests of separatists, activists and others.\n\n\u201cThe BJP\u2019s jackboot policy has created fear,\u201d said Tariq Hameed Karra, Jammu and Kashmir president of the Indian National Congress, India\u2019s biggest opposition party. \u201cThere\u2019s anger in every part of the state over the legal, constitutional, cultural, religious and economic oppression of the people.\u201d\n\nPeople were \u201cnot allowed to air their grievances\u201d, he said.\n\nIltija Mufti, a candidate for the regional People\u2019s Democratic party, which wants restoration of statehood and autonomy, said the Modi government had \u201cdisempowered and dispossessed\u201d people in the territory.\n\nWhile deadly encounters between Indian security forces and insurgents remain common, the number of people killed has fallen, according to security analysts.\n\nThey said this was in part because Pakistan, which backs Kashmiri separatism, had in the past few years been focused more on Afghanistan and on its own economic problems, according to Ajai Sahni, executive director of the Institute for Conflict Management in New Delhi.\n\n\u201cThere is a very sustained downward trend in fatalities because of improvements in Indian security force capabilities and a weakening of the economy and security force capacity in Pakistan,\u201d Sahni said.\n\nAccording to the institute\u2019s South Asian Terrorism Portal, 134 fatalities among Indian security forces, insurgents and civilians were reported in the region in 2023, down from an average of well over 1,000 per year at the height of the conflict from 1990-2006.\n\nIn Sopore, a town in lush northern Kashmir, farm workers took time off from the harvest season to queue early at a polling station surrounded by willow trees used to make cricket bats.\n\nMohammad Ramzan Ganai, 78, a supporter of Kashmir\u2019s oldest party, the National Conference, said people wanted elected representatives who would defend their basic interests, including seeking the restoration of the territory\u2019s statehood and autonomy. \u201cThis vote is different because we want our basic rights back,\u201d Ganai said.\n\nWhile the election will allow some transfer of power to a 90-seat regional assembly, Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s status as a union territory means New Delhi will have much more direct control than it does in Indian states.\n\nBringing Kashmir under the same regime as India\u2019s other states has long been a pet project for the BJP. But while Modi has voiced support for restoring statehood, the party has dismissed any suggestion it could give Jammu and Kashmir back substantial autonomy and the special rights previously granted to people defined as permanent residents.\n\nAnalysts said New Delhi\u2019s direct rule by handpicked bureaucrats had left a gap in public representation. \u201cPeople feel a disconnect with governance,\u201d said Nisar Ali, an economist on a central government data committee. \u201cTheir motivation is to elect local representatives so that they can access government services through them.\u201d\n\nIntense development of roads and other infrastructure over the past five years has converted swaths of the picturesque mountainous territory into construction sites.

Investors are attracted to country\u2019s large market, it is the world\u2019s most populous nation with 1.4bn people, and manufacturing potential at a time when economic activity is faltering in China.\n\nThe French company has fallen behind global rivals Unilever and Nestl\u00e9 in India\u2019s fast-moving consumer goods industry, where revenues are estimated by a government promotion agency to hit $616bn by 2027.\n\nDe Saint-Affrique, who has led Danone since 2021, has been charged with turning around lagging performance following a period of boardroom turmoil that resulted in the ousting of his predecessor Emmanuel Faber.\n\nSince then, Danone has sought to reverse falling sales volumes and under-investment. The company\u2019s second-quarter sales volumes this year climbed 2.9 per cent on an annual basis, beating expectations.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the top-three countries of Danone, it\u2019s [the] US, China, France,\u201d said de Saint-Affrique, speaking in the north Indian city of Chandigarh. He added that it was the company\u2019s \u201cambition\u201d for India to rank among the top five.\n\nDe Saint-Affrique, who was visiting India to announce a four-year \u20ac20mn investment to expand Danone\u2019s existing plant in Punjab, warned that if companies do not scale in India over the next decade \u201cyou will be less relevant as a global player\u201d.\n\nThe maker of Activia yoghurt and Evian bottled water has struggled to make inroads in India, the world\u2019s biggest producer of dairy products, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nHarit Kapoor, lead consumer analyst at Investec India, described Danone\u2019s history in the country as \u201cstop-start\u201d and said its current market share was \u201ctiny\u201d.\n\nDanone\u2019s 13-year partnership with Indian biscuit giant Britannia Industries, which is owned by the billionaire Wadia family, ended in 2009 following an acrimonious branding dispute. In 2018, the French company stopped producing fresh dairy and UHT products \u2014 sterilised, long-life goods that do not need refrigeration \u2014 in India.\n\n\u201c[Danone\u2019s] brands are not highly penetrated, they are very, very small,\u201d said Sachin Bobade, analyst at Mumbai-based Dolat Capital. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen their products frequently.\u201d\n\nBobade said that India\u2019s dairy market is not easy to penetrate. Dairy co-operatives, such as Amul brand owner Gujarat Milk Marketing Federation, control a 60 per cent share of Indian dairy product sales, according to estimates by Investec.\n\n\u201cOrganically creating size in the Indian market is extremely hard,\u201d said Investec\u2019s Kapoor.\n\nDanone is an \u201cexceptionally late entrant\u201d, he said. \u201cThe only way to build up quick scale, especially in say water or dairy, is to acquire.\u201d\n\nDe Saint-Affrique said that Danone had a later start in the country compared with rivals, including his former employer Unilever, which has been operating in India for decades. \u201cWe are only at the start of our growth journey in India,\u201d he said.\n\nThe chief executive did not rule out Indian acquisitions, but added: \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of things that we can do organically.\u201d\n\nDanone\u2019s experience in China and Indonesia, the company\u2019s two biggest markets in Asia, gives the company \u201ca good blueprint on what we could do in India\u201d, de Saint-Affrique added.\n\nChina, North Asia and Oceania is Danone\u2019s fastest-growing region, registering 8.4 per cent annual like-for-like sales growth in the second quarter. The company does not provide country specific data for India.\n\nIndia is \u201cof high interest to us\u201d, said de Saint-Affrique.

Wood Mackenzie expects cell manufacturing in countries outside of the main hubs of China and south-east Asia to more than double over the next couple of years, with India making up 40 per cent of new capacity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no modular manufacturer in India who is not thinking of exporting,\u201d said Subrahmanyam Pulipaka, chief executive of the National Solar Energy Federation of India, a lobbying group that counts big developers such as Adani Group, Tata Power and ReNew among its members.\n\nUS imports of Indian panels and cells surpassed $1.8bn last year, up from about $250mn the year before, according to BloombergNEF.\n\nIndian manufacturers are also investing in US factories following President Joe Biden\u2019s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, which included lucrative subsidies for domestic producers, with Waaree and VSK Energy announcing manufacturing commitments worth at least $1bn each last year.\n\n\u201cThe main advantage is that they\u2019re not Chinese,\u201d said Martin Pochtaruk, chief executive of Heliene, which operates a solar panel factory in Minnesota.\n\nThe company used to source its cells from Vietnam and Malaysia, but now purchases primarily from India to insulate itself from new tariffs. In July, Heliene announced a $150mn joint venture with Premier Energies, India\u2019s second-largest solar cell manufacturer, to build a US factory.\n\nThe Biden administration has raised protections against solar imports with ties to Beijing, doubling the duty rate for Chinese cells, applying anti-circumvention tariffs on Chinese companies in south-east Asia, and banning goods linked to forced labour in Xinjiang. The White House also maintained Trump-era tariffs that applied to solar products from most countries.\n\nDespite the efforts, US imports of panels sit at record highs. Several manufacturers, including VSK Energy, have delayed or scrapped their US manufacturing plans despite the availability of federal tax credits.\n\n\u201cTariffs haven\u2019t worked,\u201d said Pol Lezcano, a senior analyst at BloombergNEF.\n\n\u201cManufacturers don\u2019t come to the US. They don\u2019t really find the right business and supply chain environment that they need to scale up manufacturing.\u201d\n\nRapidly declining prices for imported panels have helped transform solar into the leading source of new power on the US grid. The Energy Information Administration expects solar installations this year to grow 42 per cent, reaching 127 gigawatts.\n\nIn April, the largest US solar manufacturers, First Solar and Qcells, and others filed a petition for tariffs on cells to be applied to four countries in south-east Asia in order to rescue a struggling domestic industry.\n\nLuigi Resta, president of rPlus Energies, a developer, warned that the tariffs would slow down the pace of deployment and raise prices for consumers. The company has started to source from Indonesia, another emerging solar manufacturing market, to safeguard it against trade impacts.\n\n\u201cThe nature of the industry is that we have to be very flexible,\u201d Resta said. The company now sources about 1GW of panels between Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\nIndustry executives and analysts expressed concern that plans to build production lines in tariff-exempt markets may lead the US government to play a game of \u201cWhac-A-Mole\u201d with tariffs and fine those countries in the future, risking billions in capital expenditure.\n\n\u201cIf too many people go to one place, it just ruins it for everybody,\u201d said Jim Wood, chief executive of SEG Solar.\n\nLast week the company broke ground on a $500mn factory near Jakarta, which will help supply cells to its panel factory in Texas.", "tag": "india?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/78f52ebd-13ba-4a38-843a-c156f2415e8b"}, {"uuid4": "77fd85d7-6d5e-4df3-a907-96f5da013c6b", "title": "Collector Kiran Nadar on Indian art and building museums  ", "description": "Her 15,000 artworks range from the Bombay Progressives to Olafur Eliasson and Anish Kapoor ", "author": "Georgina Adam", "published_date": "2024-10-05T04:00:46.579Z", "content": "\u201cI never had any formal art training: I just learnt as I went along,\u201d says Indian collector and philanthropist Kiran Nadar. Her vast collection of South Asian art now numbers 15,000 pieces, a small selection of which is being shown in a major exhibition at the Barbican cultural centre in London, The Imaginary Institution of India: Art 1975-1998.\n\nIn Nadar\u2019s London home, an elegant apartment in a listed building overlooking Regent\u2019s Park, one wall is dominated by a painting of horses by MF Husain \u2014 often known as the \u201cPicasso of India\u201d \u2014 while, on another wall, a painting by Manjit Bawa shows a flautist playing to a group of grey cows. Small sculptures by Henry Moore are dotted around on the tables and a beautiful inlaid ivory cabinet stands by the door.\n\nNadar, wearing a flowing green, pink and orange robe, is relaxed, friendly and open as we sit down to talk about how she started collecting, her philanthropy and the new museum she is opening in Delhi.\n\nHer collecting began once she was married. After studying English literature at university in India, Nadar met her husband, Shiv Nadar, the billionaire founder of India\u2019s HCL Technologies, when she was working in advertising and he was a client. \u201cMy first major art purchase was of two works by MF Husain for our home \u2014 in fact he was asked to paint one but he brought us two, so we kept them. And then I bought a graphic male nude, \u201cRunners\u201d (1982), by Rameshwar Broota \u2014 my husband was horrified! I was a bit crestfallen and told him we had to go to the studio and apologise [for changing our minds], but when he met the artist he said I was right to have the painting. And it is in his study to this day.\u201d\n\nBut it was only after buying work by Manjit Bawa that she became \u201cgalvanised\u201d: \u201cI never really thought I was collecting, just acquiring. But then it reached a stage that we had no more wall space and I was just putting them into storage. It wasn\u2019t even formalised storage, it was in the basement. I realised it was a bit futile to leave them like that.\n\nBy 2010 she had acquired 500 works, so she decided to create a space to show them, the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA) \u2014 initially on the HCL campus in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, then in South Court Mall in New Delhi, supported by the Shiv Nadar Foundation. A vast new museum, designed by Adjaye Associates, will open on a 100,000-square-metre site directly across from the Indira Gandhi international airport in New Delhi in 2026 or 2027.\n\nI ask her about the choice of the Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye for her new museum. Since that decision was taken in 2019, Adjaye has been accused of sexual assault, sexual harassment and promoting a toxic work culture according to an investigation in the Financial Times last year, allegations which he has denied.\n\n\u201cThe choice [of Adjaye] was made by a jury\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009which whittled applicants to six, out of the initial 60. And Adjaye was the outright winner,\u201d says Nadar. (A 2019 press release said there were five on the shortlist from 47 applicants.) \u201cAt that stage, we had absolutely no idea about David\u2019s personal life and we had paid about two-thirds of what our commitment was. So we continue to work with Adjaye Associates and David will not be involved as a person, on any of our projects, until such time that we are comfortable. That\u2019s the way it stands today.\u201d\n\nWhile her collecting focus was on works by the Bombay Progressive Artists\u2019 Group, a Mumbai-based collective of artists synthesising Indian art history and European Modernism from 1947, she also bought contemporary art: \u201cI bought at huge prices. Then the crash came and even today some of the works haven\u2019t reached what I paid for them at that time.\u201d That \u201ccrash\u201d, specifically in Indian art, took place in 2006-07 and was fuelled by speculation and the creation of art funds. Prices continued to fall over the next few years, in some cases, as she says, never to recover.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re keen that Indian art gets more international recognition,\u201d she says. KNMA part-funded the Indian pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2019 (only the second time the country has staged one) and this year organised a retrospective of MF Husain there. \u201cIndia is such an important country. Every country has a pavilion [at the Biennale] and so should we; if there is no space in the Giardini, there must be another important space [the Biennale organisers] can give us. I think at the next Biennale, India will have its own space.\u201d\n\nAs well as Indian art, Nadar\u2019s collection includes western names: she mentions Antony Gormley, Olafur Eliasson and William Kentridge, as well as South Asian diaspora artists such as Shahzia Sikander, Anish Kapoor and Raqib Shaw.\n\nArt isn\u2019t her only passion. \u201cI\u2019m actually very multi-dimensional!\u201d she exclaims, waving a hand in the air. She is one of India\u2019s foremost bridge players and will represent her country at the World Bridge Games in Buenos Aires this year.\n\nI bring the conversation back to the future of her collection. \u201cFor the moment it is funded by the foundation, but there will be an endowment. I can\u2019t be here for ever, and I can\u2019t leave it in hands where it\u2019s not going to serve: we will make sure it will be very, very professional.\u201d\n\n\u2018The Imaginary Institution of India: Art 1975-1998\u2019 runs to January 5, barbican.org.uk", "tag": "india?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/09d5a41c-0da4-4fdb-a6d0-d235cb13c296"}, {"uuid4": "19867e81-cf76-48eb-b234-e8184c3dfaac", "title": "India is getting serious about wine. What will that mean?", "description": "The latest hobby enjoyed by affluent Indians might give producers reason to be cheerful", "author": "Jancis Robinson", "published_date": "2024-10-05T04:00:46.309Z", "content": "When I arrived in India for a few days recently, I was puzzled by Indian consumers\u2019 and producers\u2019 attachment to powerful reds. The country\u2019s most celebrated wine, J\u2019Noon, is a blockbuster if ever there was one. Surely, in India\u2019s sultry climate, the refreshment of whites and ros\u00e9s is needed, or at least a lighter red such as a Pinot Noir?\n\nWhen, for the third night running, I got back to my hotel room shivering from the aggressive air conditioning during dinner, the penny dropped. Wine in India is becoming increasingly common, but it\u2019s the drink of the well-off and the well-off are devoted to fiendish air con. Perhaps they need those full-bodied reds to warm themselves up?\n\nDespite punitive import duties of 150 per cent by value, and complex regulations and taxes that differ state by state (some of which are dry), wine has steadily been replacing cocktails and whisky among affluent Indians.\n\nDuring my time in Delhi and Mumbai I was told that many Indian drinkers believe that red wine is good for their health. The World Health Organization may disagree but the burgeoning Indian wine trade is not minded to draw their customers\u2019 attention to this. And the theory that India\u2019s highly spiced food doesn\u2019t go with wine has largely been abandoned.\n\nWe enjoyed a range of wines carrying nine of India\u2019s most respected labels with the excellent Indian cuisine of Masque restaurant in Mumbai\u2019s old mill district, the fashionably grungy equivalent of east London or Brooklyn. This was at a special dinner organised by India\u2019s one and only Master of Wine, Sonal Holland. The wines had improved considerably since my last visit in 2017.\n\nHridhay Mehra, Masque\u2019s head sommelier, confirmed the cultural hurdles that wine has had to overcome in many sectors of Indian society. \u201cIt took ages for me to convince my parents that I drink for a living. I used to have to hide bottles of wine in my bedroom cupboard,\u201d he told me. A few days later, back in London, I was to meet a young Indian-born wine writer who emigrated to America with her parents as a teenager. Her mother, a keen wine drinker, still drinks it out of a cup rather than a more revealing glass, she said.\n\nThe Masque dinner was the first time these nine producers had met socially. Holland asked them each to provide one wine and found, perhaps inevitably, that most of them wanted to show a full-bodied red. A notable exception was the LVMH-owned sparkling-wine producer Chandon, which provided our sparkling ros\u00e9 aperitif made in the same way as its stablemate in Champagne, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon. But even this definitively effervescent company has just launched a still red, Aurva Shiraz 2021, under a screwcap.\n\nShiraz is the most-prized variety of winegrape in India and does well in the heartland of Indian viticulture, Nashik, a four-hour drive north-east of Mumbai. Cabernet Sauvignon does better in Solapur, seven hours to the south-east of Mumbai, where the nights are warmer. Chenin Blanc is the most popular grape for white wines.\n\nThere is now a Wine Growers of India association, encouraged by Ashwin Rodrigues, owner and chief winemaker of Good Earth Wine, who gained his winemaking experience in the Barossa Valley. He excitedly told me that the association now holds technical meetings \u201cfor winemakers, not CEOs\u201d at which they serve each others\u2019 wines blind and comment on them, all in aid of improving the quality of Indian wine overall.\n\nHe was seated at our table at this dinner, and I heard him ask Ipsita Das, managing director of Mo\u00ebt Hennessy India, why she recently raised the price of Chandon quite substantially, to the equivalent of about \u00a325 a bottle. \u201cWe thought India was ready for a premium wine,\u201d she answered with a careful smile, before admitting, \u201cIt has been a tough journey.\u201d As a fellow Indian wine producer trying to balance the books, Rodrigues expressed deep gratitude for her move, although a more cynical diner at our table observed, \u201cIndians are still learning to drink sparkling water, let alone sparkling wine.\u201d\n\nPer capita consumption of wine may have risen in recent years, but it\u2019s still not much more than two centilitres a year. Although, as one wine professional pointed out, \u201cIf we all consumed wine, there\u2019d be none left for anyone else in the world\u201d. This seems unlikely, given the extreme poverty experienced by so many Indians, but a report from research group IWSR on prospects for alcoholic drinks identified India as the country with the greatest volume growth last year and one of the few expected to grow in future.\n\nPartly because of those import taxes, 75 per cent of wine sold in India is Indian and Rajeev Samant of Sula Vineyards has a 60 per cent share of that 75 per cent. Inspired by what he saw in California, Samant has been in the business for 25 years. Countless Indians have had their first-ever taste of grape-based wine at Sula\u2019s tourist-focused winery in Nashik, so Samant bears considerable responsibility for the prospects of the Indian wine market. Sula has become so ubiquitous that Samant has been developing other labels such as The Source and R\u0100S\u0100 (another full-bodied red).\n\nBut the really well-heeled drink imported wine. At another dinner, I sat next to one wine lover who commutes between London and Mumbai and told me he always loads up at the Mayfair wine treasure trove Hedonism before travelling back to India and goes gamely, and expensively, through the red channel on arrival.\n\nWhen Holland started out in wine 17 years ago, there were very few Indian wine professionals, but the Indian wine importers I met recently were admirably well informed. I was told that Italian reds, particularly from Tuscany, are currently popular but that the reputation of Bordeaux has been harmed by too many poor-quality wines.\n\nIn another sign of the times, this month sees the establishment of the Sommeliers Association of India by Bordeaux-based Master of Wine hopeful Amrita Singh. There are apparently already 35 to 40 candidates for professional somm exams, and the first Indian qualified as a Master Sommelier in August. Kamal Malik currently works for a wine importer in the Maldives.\n\nThe Indian sommeliers I met were unanimous that more somms are needed in their country, pointing out that there are probably a thousand bartenders for every wine waiter. Supply is hindered by the fact that even top hospitality schools are not allowed to serve alcohol to anyone under 25 \u2014 virtually all their students.\n\nThere may be only 10 Indians resident in India who have reached the top, Diploma, level of Wine & Spirit Education Trust courses, but early evening wine tastings have become a popular leisure activity. Devati Mallick, a young woman who organises them, assured me that when Indians travel, they tend to become interested in wines from the regions they explore.\n\nSusmita Bomzon worked in Dubai before returning to her native India to set up, in 2023, the country\u2019s first wine bar, Captain\u2019s Cellar, in the basement of the Taj Mahal hotel in New Delhi. Thanks to Enomatic wine dispenser cabinets, she offers 48 wines, Indian and imported, by the glass. According to Master of Wine Holland, \u201cFifteen years ago this would have been unthinkable.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that Australia, having been crippled by punitive tariffs imposed by China in 2020, decided to look to India for new export opportunities, concluding a trade agreement in 2022. This is one rapidly growing market that gives the world\u2019s wine producers, concerned about shrinking sales elsewhere, some reason to be hopeful.\n\nTasting notes, scores and suggested drink dates on Purple Pages of JancisRobinson.com.

The value of the company plunged, and investors were forced to write off stakes worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nCreditors of Byju\u2019s are now in US courts to locate almost half of a $1.2bn loan, while the company fights insolvency proceedings in India over delayed national cricket authority sponsorship dues.

While the platform still has about 7mn paying users, the number of employees \u2014 more than half of them teachers \u2014 has plunged from about 80,000 at its peak to about 27,000 today, Raveendran said.\n\nSubramanian questioned why investors tolerated Byju\u2019s delayed filing of accounts and pointed out that the company did not have a chief financial officer for 16 months between 2021 and 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Byju\u2019s saga has a general resonance,\u201d Subramanian added. \u201cThere is an element of caution and more scrutiny of start-ups, investors are expecting more due diligence and a path to profitability. No more is there a blind throwing of money.\u201d\n\nTotal annual funding to Indian start-ups was $32bn last year, less than half of the 2020 peak of $67.3bn, according to Tracxn.\n\n\u201cThe different layers of scandal that have draped this company for the last couple of years create a very complex cocktail of issues,\u201d said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, a Singapore-based analyst at Aletheia Capital. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for the tech ecosystem in India.\u201d\n\nA lawsuit launched in Delaware by a group of more than 100 creditors to recover $533mn of the $1.2bn syndicated loan to Byju\u2019s secured in November 2021 has revealed disorganisation at the edtech company.\n\nEarlier this year, Raveendran\u2019s brother Riju struggled to explain to a US judge that he did not know the whereabouts of $533mn of the loan. Riju, who was the sole director of US-based Byju\u2019s Alpha, a company created to receive loans, said in May: \u201cI really don\u2019t know where the money is.\u201d\n\nRiju, who lives with Raveendran and his wife Divya Gokulnath, the company\u2019s husband-and-wife co-founders, in Dubai\u2019s affluent Emirates Hills community, said he had sent emails asking them where the money was.\n\nRaveendran said Riju had not lied as he had restricted information to him.\n\nRiju\u2019s attempts to find the funds \u201cwere tepid at best\u201d and his \u201ctestimony lacks all credibility\u201d, said US bankruptcy judge John Dorsey at the May hearing. The court found him in contempt and in July imposed a fine of $10,000 a day until the money was located.\n\n\u201cI have struggled in my own mind whether we are seeing ineptitude\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009or we\u2019re seeing something more nefarious,\u201d said Ravi Shankar, a Kirkland & Ellis advocate acting for Glas Trust, an agency representing more than 100 Byju\u2019s creditors. \u201cTwo brothers doing whatever it can take to salvage a crumbling empire.\u201d\n\nAfter Byju\u2019s Alpha was accused by the creditors of default, they removed Riju as sole director of the company in 2023 and installed Timothy Pohl, a restructuring expert. Last month, Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court affirmed that default.\n\nPohl unearthed bank accounts that showed transfers signed off by Riju to a little-known Florida-based hedge fund Camshaft Capital. It was set up in 2020 and registered with the address of an IHOP pancake restaurant in Miami by then-23-year-old William Morton, a high school dropout with no investment qualifications.\n\nIn a separate Florida suit, the creditors\u2019 lawyers allege Morton splurged on Ferrari, Lamborghini and Rolls-Royce cars after the Byju\u2019s transfer, as well as a condo with an ocean view with a listed monthly rent of $29,000.\n\nMorton\u2019s lawyers said Camshaft \u201cvigorously denies\u201d the allegations. In June, they told the Delaware court that millions of dollars in fees he received in the deal were \u201cnot with us today\u201d.\n\nEarlier this year, it emerged in court that Camshaft transferred the funds to OCI, a British company. The creditors\u2019 lawyers are now seeking documents about the transfer in UK courts. Morton and OCI did not respond to a request for comment. Raveendran said Camshaft had not lost the company money and declined to comment on OCI.\n\nRiju\u2019s lawyers at the end of July said in court that funds were spent on goods and services for Byju\u2019s and \u201cnot for an improper purpose\u201d. Byju\u2019s has launched a counter-lawsuit in New York against the lenders, accusing them of unfairly accelerating the loan terms and negotiating in \u201cbad faith\u201d.\n\nRaveendran added \u201cthere has never been any fraud\u201d and \u201cnot a single dollar\u201d of the loan was transferred to India or personal accounts.\n\nByju\u2019s faces more legal challenges in India. The Qatar Investment Authority \u2014 the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, which invested in the company and loaned Raveendran $250mn in 2022 \u2014 is fighting in a Karnataka court to claim back more than $200mn from him. Raveendran declined to comment on the QIA case.\n\nByju\u2019s was also pushed into bankruptcy proceedings in India by the country\u2019s national cricket authority over unpaid sponsorship dues. Although the company settled the case in August, India\u2019s Supreme Court stayed the settlement order after the US creditors alleged Byju\u2019s might have used money from their loan to pay the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Byju\u2019s has denied the allegation.\n\nThe lenders know that time is not on their side. Earlier this year, they said the cost of recovering the funds could make \u201cfinding the money nothing more than a Pyrrhic victory\u201d.Raveendran said Byju\u2019s would pay back the lenders. \u201cIf they have the patience, come work with me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will make a comeback.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8788b2d7-98c1-469b-acbc-fd5fadd97939"}, {"uuid4": "0fd94f01-c35c-4e7d-8fc3-01bcdd2341ec", "title": "Indian appetite for Swiss watches grows", "description": "Brands increase exports to meet demand from exponentially growing luxury market", "author": "Kate Youde", "published_date": "2024-10-04T03:00:32.634Z", "content": "Swiss watch exports have fallen this year, but one market is showing strong growth: India. Exports to the country rose 20 per cent in value, year on year, in the first seven months of 2024 to SFr139.5mn ($165mn), compared with a 2.4 per cent fall globally. And that export value represents a 41.4 per cent increase on the same period in 2022 \u2014 the largest rise recorded by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry for any market, over such a timescale.\n\nNow, a trade deal is set to make watch exports even easier. In March, India signed an agreement with the European Free Trade Association to phase out custom duties on Swiss watches (about 20 per cent) within seven years and give improved protection around the use of the terms \u201cSwiss\u201d or \u201cSwitzerland\u201d.\n\nIndia is, in many ways, an ideal watch market. It was the fastest-growing major economy in last month\u2019s World Bank update, and one in which the number of millionaires (in US dollars) will rise 22 per cent between 2023 and 2028, to 1,061,463, according to the latest UBS Global Wealth Report. The Deloitte Swiss Watch Industry Study 2023 flagged the country as the \u201cnext big growth market\u201d, and found that 94 per cent of Indian consumers wear a watch (in the US, it is 79 per cent).\n\n\u201cAs the population is getting more wealthy and developing, and the luxury market is exponentially growing compared with the consumer market, there\u2019s an upgrade [in the watches people buy],\u201d says Karine Szegedi, consumer industry and fashion and luxury lead at Deloitte Switzerland, and the study\u2019s co-author.\n\nWatchmakers are expanding their retail presence. IWC opened its first boutique in India, at Jio Mall in Mumbai, last November. Then Breitling launched boutiques in Chennai and Pune earlier this year, having opened its first Indian store in Hyderabad in 2023. It plans to have boutiques in each of the country\u2019s top eight to 10 cities.\n\nThis focus comes amid a slump in sales in China, the second-largest export market for Swiss watches. There, the value of exports fell 23.2 per cent, year on year, between January and July, to SFr1,269.5mn. \u201cWe\u2019re being asked if [India] will be offsetting the maybe softer results in China,\u201d says Szegedi. \u201cNot yet, because it\u2019s an immature market\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009We believe that now, as well, with the EFTA agreement, you have to enter it to test it and see how the market responds to your brands.\u201d\n\nGerald Charles started working with Ethos Watches, an Indian retailer, in Delhi and Mumbai last November after noticing rising demand from rich Indians who were travelling to, or had homes in, Dubai. It launched in two further locations, Bengaluru and Kochi, last month. Federico Ziviani, Gerald Charles chief executive, says there will be a fifth opening next year \u2014 bringing the brand, which he says makes 1,500 watches a year, to capacity for the country .\n\nHe says the Indian market, where the brand\u2019s emerald green watches are popular, is robust because it is driven by internal demand. \u201cThinking about what happened during Covid, where travelling was blocked, only the strong local markets performed well,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to be in India, rather than selling to Indian collectors from abroad, because this creates a service to them, because they have the watch right at [their] doorstep. [It also] creates robustness in case of any geopolitical or economic changes.\u201d\n\nZiviani says the challenge in a country of 1.4bn people is getting the watch \u201con the right wrist\u201d. \u201cWe have the advantage that the Gerald Charles watch\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009is very polarising,\u201d he says. \u201cYou hate it or love it\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009so there is a strong component in the client choosing us.\u201d\n\nCricket \u2014 a sport beloved in India \u2014 is influential in growing brand awareness. Panerai previously had former India captain MS Dhoni as an ambassador and collaborated with him on two limited edition timepieces exclusive to the Indian market in 2019. Mohit Hemdev, Panerai brand manager for India, says this \u201creally helped the brand get the right kind of visibility in the market\u201d.\n\nJean-Marc Pontrou\u00e9, chief executive of Panerai, says exposure through cricket and the \u201cevolution\u201d of India meant the time was right for expansion. \u201cYou see the number of planes this country is ordering, the new facilities built, new industries growing \u2014 that is contributing to the development of the country, which creates a growing affluent customer group,\u201d he says. However, he says Panerai\u2019s growth will depend on \u201cthe speed of the luxury industry\u201d \u2014 such as the development of malls.\n\nPanerai opens its fourth India boutique, in Bengaluru, this month. The brand also has 10 points of sale across six cities with partners including TimeVall\u00e9e, the Richemont-owned multi-brand retailer. Pontrou\u00e9 says Panerai has tripled its business in India since 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s by far the fastest-growing nationality we see appearing more and more with knowledge of luxury watches,\u201d he says.\n\nPontrou\u00e9 says that, while India has a long association with jewellery, the more recent appetite for high-end watches is driven by interest in gold, jewellery watches, and Switzerland. Hundreds of Bollywood films have been at least partially shot in Switzerland, against scenic backdrops such as the Alps. \u201c[For] a lot of Indians, their first or second European destination to visit becomes Switzerland,\u201d says Hemdev.\n\nRado, which has worked with Indian Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan since 2011, took on British Bollywood actress Katrina Kaif as an ambassador last October to target female customers. Adrian Bosshard, Rado chief executive, says there has been an \u201coverproportion increase\u201d in its women\u2019s watch segment in India this year and last.\n\nOther brands are seeking to attract clients with special releases. Carl F Bucherer launched a Heritage BiCompax Annual Hometown limited edition dedicated to New Delhi, featuring city landmarks engraved on the case back, with Ethos Watches in June. Raymond Weil, which has traded in India since the early 1980s, launched the Freelancer Ganges India limited edition last October to celebrate 20 years of its own collaboration with Ethos.\n\nRado saw India overtake China as its largest market for sales about two years ago, says Bosshard. The brand has 33 boutiques in India and more than 200 other points of sale. Bosshard says Rado has built \u201ccustomer confidence\u201d, which helps as Indian consumers \u201care very cautious to have value for money\u201d. For this reason, the brand\u2019s ceramic watches are popular, he says, because their \u201cscratch resistance\u201d means they have \u201ca long-term beauty on your wrist\u201d.\n\nAn informal survey of about 100 partners and directors from Deloitte Consulting in India in July found that, while Rolex was the most recognised Swiss watch brand, it was followed by Swatch Group houses Omega, Tissot and Rado, respectively, showcasing the early investment that group made in the market. Popular high-end brands, including Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and Richard Mille, did not feature in this top 10 for brand recognition in India.\n\nBosshard compares the situation in India to what he saw in China 20 years ago. \u201cPurchasing power is growing and, of course, in this kind of environment people want to celebrate themselves.\u201d\n\nOne opportunity identified in the Deloitte Swiss Watch Industry spotlight on India, from July, is to tap into wedding gifting. It found 40 per cent of Indians planning to buy a watch within 12 months would do so for a present, compared with 27 per cent globally.\n\nDeloitte\u2019s 2023 study predicted India would be in the top 10 of Swiss watch export markets within a decade. It was 22nd in July. However, Bosshard would not be surprised if this happened within seven, or even five, years.", "tag": "india?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7acfb8fa-993a-408f-a256-fc5f2dfbdee1"}, {"uuid4": "334d81ae-f05b-4b34-8de4-2374ce573363", "title": "India\u2019s economic mismatch: not enough jobs and not enough workers", "description": "Employment crisis looms over Narendra Modi\u2019s third term as opposition looks to unseat ruling BJP in regional polls", "author": "Jyotsna Singh", "published_date": "2024-10-02T04:02:35.842Z", "content": "Ajesh Kumar, a college graduate in a village in Haryana, a rural state bordering Delhi, recently applied to work as a cleaner. But there were more than 400,000 jobseekers for an estimated 5,000 positions, making the 30-year-old\u2019s chances about one in 80.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no hope, no chance\u201d of getting one of the government posts, Kumar said, which are prized because of the guaranteed hours, wages and benefits, however low, of public sector work. Among the applicants were two of his family members.\n\nKumar is one face of India\u2019s most intractable public policy issue: a chronic shortage of formal jobs in the world\u2019s most populous country and, according to companies, a corresponding shortage of suitable candidates to fill them.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s economic record will again be on the agenda in Haryana on Saturday in one in a series of regional polls in which the opposition will seek to build momentum against his Bharatiya Janata party. The opposition managed to push the BJP into a parliamentary minority for the first time since 2014 in nationwide elections this year, in part by highlighting persistently high joblessness.\n\nIndia\u2019s economy is failing to create enough jobs for its young and growing population and train the skilled workers its companies need to harness that demographic dividend. This mismatch is feeding widespread grievances and represents one of the biggest challenges for Modi as he enters his second decade in power.\n\n\u201cEvery month about a million formal job seekers are being added to the workforce,\u201d said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder of Teamlease, which describes itself as India\u2019s biggest staffing company. \u201cNine out of 10 of them go into the informal sector \u2014 jobs where there is no employment contract, no social security benefits, no protection, and no wage guarantees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe poorest Indians tend to take on daily wage jobs in things like construction because there aren\u2019t too many alternatives,\u201d said Shruti Rajagopalan, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, in Virginia.\n\n\u201cThe people in the middle are still waiting, and would rather hold out for a government job, or work on the family farm because at least it provides them food security.\u201d\n\nModi\u2019s government has taken steps to tackle India\u2019s joblessness. In the first post-election budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an apprenticeship scheme aimed at benefiting 10mn young people over five years. The government has also promised training subsidies for companies, stipends for apprenticeships and help for vocational schools to amend their curricula to align with job market demands.\n\nIn its previous term, Modi\u2019s cabinet also cut corporate taxes and took steps to amend labour laws in a bid to stimulate job growth.\n\nCorporate India, however, laments a shortage of qualified candidates for its top jobs. Conglomerate Larsen & Toubro said in June that it faced a shortage of 45,000 skilled labourers and engineers across its businesses, which range from construction to information technology.\n\nAnalysts said the skills gap bodes ill for Modi\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d manufacturing push, and attests to neglect and uneven standards at Indian secondary institutions.\n\n\u201cSo many people come out of these colleges, but we can do a lot to make them more employable in the industry,\u201d K Krithivasan, chief executive of Tata Consultancy Services, India\u2019s biggest IT company, told the Financial Times earlier this year.\n\nMohandas Pai, chair of private equity firm Aarin Capital and former chief financial officer at IT giant Infosys, said most industries were struggling to find skilled workers as India\u2019s economy expands at an annual clip of about 7 per cent, with job openings outpacing the supply of employable workers.\n\nAt the same time, he said: \u201cMany industries are not willing to spend money to hire them, skill them and train them.\u201d\n\nA study published this year by Quess Corp, an Indian business service provider, and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry argued that India faced a wage \u2014 rather than an employment \u2014 problem. About 80 per cent of jobs pay less than Rs20,000 ($238) a month, not enough to meet rising living expenses, the study\u2019s authors argued.\n\nOn the supply side, economists say cumbersome labour regulation is also holding back industry from creating jobs. Much of the legislation only kicks in for companies employing 10 people or more, points out George Mason University\u2019s Rajagopalan. \u201cEither people are not hiring the 10th worker, or they hire the worker informally,\u201d she said.\n\nModi\u2019s government in 2020 approved an overhaul of India\u2019s patchwork of labour laws, which regulate areas ranging from maximum shift hours to the number of clocks per factory floor. But the reforms have yet to take effect.\n\nThere is even disagreement over how to measure India\u2019s unemployment. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a think-tank, publishes the most widely cited indicator, which is conducted monthly. In August, it showed a jobless rate at 8.51 per cent, and unemployment on a rising trend.\n\n\u201cThis is a pretty high unemployment rate in a country growing at 7 to 8 per cent per annum,\u201d said Mahesh Vyas, CMIE\u2019s managing director. \u201cWe have also been seeing the unemployment rate very high for a long period now in both rural and urban regions.\u201d\n\nModi\u2019s political circle favours the Periodic Labour Force Survey, which reports quarterly rural and urban unemployment rates and shows the jobless rate at below 5 per cent and falling.\n\nAnalysts said the discrepancy was because of what counted as work, including part-time agricultural work.\n\nVyas claims the definition of a job in the PLFS is \u201ctoo relaxed\u201d. He also pointed to growth of India\u2019s net fixed assets at companies, which he said served as a proxy for employment and joblessness and had been growing at only about 5-6 per cent in recent years.\n\n\u201cEmployment will increase only if investments increase, and I don\u2019t see that,\u201d Vyas said.\n\nKumar, in Haryana, for example, might or might not qualify as unemployed depending on who is counting. He is earning some money on commission for a company that sells cattle feed, and is considering setting up a dairy business with his brother.\n\nLike many young Indians, he also aspired to an army post, completing a correspondence degree in political science and passing the written test three times. But he was rejected in the interview.\n\n\u201cYou need sources and contacts when you reach that level,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cI did not have them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have given up looking for jobs,\u201d he added.\n\n\u200bLetter in response to this article:\n\nIndia\u2019s rich are the main beneficiaries of growth\u00a0/\u00a0From Deepankar Basu, Associate Professor, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, US", "tag": "india?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/14fc147e-8f11-45d7-9e7f-2ee97f899eea"}, {"uuid4": "5fa5599c-3c20-4156-93cb-451b61e89bae", "title": "India tightens derivatives trading rules after retail options frenzy", "description": "Regulator aims to clamp down on country\u2019s retail trading mania", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2024-10-01T15:56:51.117Z", "content": "India\u2019s capital markets regulator has raised the barriers on derivatives trading to curb the frenzy among millions of young retail investors who have piled into high-risk options and short-term bets on the country\u2019s booming stock market.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India on Tuesday imposed tough measures including raising the minimum contract size on index derivatives by about three times to at least Rs1.5mn ($18,000). It also reduced the amount of tradable weekly options contracts to one per exchange from November.\n\nThe crackdown comes after the watchdog and India\u2019s finance ministry repeatedly issued warnings about the risks involved in derivatives markets. Investors can use options to leverage their bets, by borrowing many times the amount they have on deposit, but they can magnify losses as well as gains.\n\nThe Indian stock market has soared in recent years as the country has become the world\u2019s fastest growing large economy. While its expanding number of middle-class households are increasingly investing their savings in domestic equities, analysts have likened the fevered interest in derivatives trading to gambling in a nation where betting is not legal.\n\n\u201cThe equity cult has been going up in India,\u201d said Kranthi Bathini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities in Mumbai.\n\nThe problem is \u201cuninformed, uneducated investors are becoming prey to this retail speculative frenzy, that\u2019s where the regulator and the ministry of finance is concerned\u201d, he added.\n\nMany Indians have also been spurred on by a proliferation of cheap discount online brokerages and popular, if largely unregulated, \u201cfinfluencers\u201d who dish out trading tips on social media.\n\nIn a recent study, Sebi said fewer than one in 10 future and options traders made a profit.

Most of them resided in the country\u2019s smaller cities and were below the age of 40.\n\nThe trend has drawn wider global attention after the notional value of options on India\u2019s benchmark Nifty 50 index overtook those on the S&P 500 and quant trading firm Jane Street reportedly made $1bn on trades in the country\u2019s option market last year.\n\nSebi\u2019s action is just the latest attempt to cool India\u2019s retail trading mania. While its latest order was published after local market hours, in July shares of listed Indian brokerages, which have cashed in on the derivatives boom, fell after new rules mandated uniform charges that are not discounted for high volumes.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s new curbs would \u201chave some impact\u201d, Bathini said.", "tag": "india?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/27e14b48-fcaa-459d-b036-a059af67b9a0"}, {"uuid4": "978d2a4c-d7b4-4ef2-8171-0d0366a6057f", "title": "The key to India\u2019s economy?

The 31-year-old lay down to sleep in a seminar room at the end of a 36-hour shift. The following morning, the woman \u2014 known publicly by the pseudonym Abhaya (\u201cfearless\u201d) because of an Indian law protecting the identities of victims \u2014 was found dead with appalling injuries, including signs of sexual assault.\n\nAccording to her colleagues, the state-run hospital lacks adequate facilities; doctors and patients of both genders are forced to share bathrooms, conditions described as both unsanitary and unsafe.\n\nThis is hardly the first instance of a brutal attack against a woman to cause shock and outrage across India. But the crime \u2014\u00a0and the protests \u2014 are resonating with unusual force. \u201cNowhere is safe for women,\u201d says Shyamadra Sarkar, 24, a medical student in Kolkata.

But the nation currently employs only about a third of its women.\n\nThe prime minister has voiced frequent support for women-led development, including at last year\u2019s international events around the G20, which India chaired.\n\nSpeaking in August shortly after the murder, Gita Gopinath, deputy managing director of the IMF \u2014 one of India\u2019s most globally prominent professional women \u2014 described women\u2019s safety as \u201cnon-negotiable and crucial in getting more women employed\u201d, adding: \u201cThat cannot happen if women do not feel safe at work.\u201d\n\nMany economists have argued that encouraging more women to enter the paid workforce is one of the most important steps that India could undertake to turbocharge growth.\n\nThe World Bank has estimated that if women\u2019s participation in the workforce were to reach 50 per cent, India could boost its annual growth rate by 1.5 percentage points. Christine Lagarde, then IMF managing director, stated in 2015 that India\u2019s GDP would be nearly 30 per cent larger if the participation of women were to match that of men, describing this as an \u201ceconomic no-brainer\u201d.\n\nMany of Asia\u2019s successful manufacturing economies have benefited from creating safe, welcoming workplaces for women. Female workers notably played a key role in building the economy of China, India\u2019s biggest neighbour and rival. In Vietnam, nearly 70 per cent of women are in paid work, far above the global average.\n\nAdding to the pressure for change is India\u2019s aspiration to draw in foreign direct investment from companies exiting China. Multibillion-dollar government subsidies for export industries, part of the country\u2019s bid to become a \u201cChina plus-one\u201d manufacturing power, have targeted electronics \u2014 a sector where producers like Samsung and Apple tend to prize female workers\u2019 focus and dexterity over men\u2019s.\n\n\u201cGender is now macro-critical in India,\u201d says Radhicka Kapoor, a senior specialist on employment with the International Labour Organization in New Delhi. \u201cWhen you have all these targets of becoming a developed economy by 2047, you need additional drivers of growth \u2014 and addressing the gender gap is an important part of that.\u201d\n\nIndian politicians agree there is a clear link between women\u2019s safety \u2014 their ability to get to and from jobs unharmed, and work without fear once they are there \u2014 and their underrepresentation in the workforce. Families and lawmakers routinely cite safety concerns as a reason to keep women out of the labour force, or restrict where and when they can work.\n\n\u201cConversations around the safety of women can switch into very high gear,\u201d says Rukmini S, an independent data journalist and author of the book Whole Numbers and Half Truths. \u201cThis has an impact on perceptions and the willingness to send women out to work.\u201d\n\nAccording to India\u2019s national crime record bureau, the recorded rate of all crimes against women rose about 13 per cent over the four years to 2022, though analysts say it is hard to assess whether this is attributable to better reporting and more women speaking out, or a genuine increase in incidents.\n\nThe Georgetown Institute\u2019s 2023 Women Peace and Security Index ranked India 128th out of 177 countries globally, and highlights areas for improvement in women\u2019s empowerment, justice and safety. The ranking noted a marked drop in women\u2019s perception of their own safety since 2017, when the survey began.\n\nA report by the economic think-tank Prosperiti recently highlighted persistent workplace discrimination against women, noting that more than 50 laws limit employment in industries deemed hazardous, as varied as in the petroleum industry and liquor sales. Twenty-four of India\u2019s 36 states and territories restrict women\u2019s right to work on night shifts, while 11 states prohibit women entirely from working at night \u2014\u00a0measures designed to protect women, but which have the effect of limiting their participation in the workforce even further.\n\nCampaigners have called for reforms to address gender stereotypes in legislation and encourage solutions like CCTV and safer transport. But change has been slow. Since 2022, a few states, including Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, have eased their restrictions on night shifts \u2014 partly because of pressure from manufacturers such as Apple and its supplier Foxconn, which are expanding their operations there.\n\nWomen do, of course, contribute enormous amounts to the Indian economy, but largely via unpaid work at home, in family businesses or in agriculture. Because of entrenched patriarchal and cultural norms, Indian women are heavily burdened by caregiving responsibilities, analysts say, limiting workforce supply. A recent government report estimated that childcare and home commitments kept 44.5 per cent of women out of work.\n\nAs so often, it is a vicious cycle. \u201cEmployers discriminate against women as they are perceived as less attached to their jobs than men,\u201d says the ILO\u2019s Kapoor. And in a country where good jobs are scarce, opportunities are more limited still.\n\nComparative data shows that India lags most of its south Asian neighbours when it comes to women in paid work \u2014 even poorer countries like Bangladesh, where women dominate one of the continent\u2019s biggest garment industries. And such discrimination spans class divides, with some wealthier families keeping women at home because they can afford to.\n\n\u201cIn India, more prosperous families prefer that the daughter-in-law doesn\u2019t work outside the house,\u201d says Swati Narayan, author of Unequal, a book about how India compares to its neighbours in areas such as health, education and work.\n\nDespite being in a weakened position after an election in which his party lost its majority, Modi is pushing forward with his Viksit Bharat programme.\n\n\u201cIt would be harder for India to become a Viksit Bharat by 2047 if one-third of the population is not engaging \u2014 most likely not out of choice but because there are limited opportunities,\u201d argues Poonam Gupta, director of the National Council of Applied Economic Research.\n\nThe government has put in place policies and benefits designed to support women, including a Rs100 ($1) cut in the price of cooking gas \u2014 announced on March 8, International Women\u2019s Day. According to a statement put out by the prime minister, this was a way of \u201cempowering women and ensuring \u2018ease of living\u2019 for them\u201d.\n\nEconomists point out, however, that such policies incentivise women to stay at home, and that it might be more valuable for the state to create employment in areas where women are under-represented, including law enforcement; according to a 2022 study, women made up just over 10 per cent of India\u2019s police force.\n\nModi\u2019s own council of ministers features only seven women \u2014 fewer than 10 per cent of the total. Despite changes to legislation aimed at making boardrooms more inclusive, women hold just 18 per cent of board seats in India, compared with a global average of more than 23 per cent.\n\n\u201cFor women-led development, we need more women leaders,\u201d says Gupta. \u201cBuilding the pipeline for women\u2019s leadership requires both intention and concerted measures.\u201d\n\nA working paper on \u201cunshackling job creators\u201d, prepared under the auspices of Viksit Bharat by a government think-tank and published in June, envisions a future in which women make up more than half of India\u2019s high-skilled labour force, and makes recommendations on reducing \u201cstructural barriers\u201d to women\u2019s work, including childcare responsibilities and restrictive social norms.\n\nGupta, the NCAER economist, calls for measures that would allow women to move around and travel without fear \u2014 a key to the huge expansion of manufacturing in Vietnam, for example. \u201cWe have to make every space in the country safe for women,\u201d she says.\n\nSome have tried to find tech-based solutions. As long as a decade ago, in the wake of a Delhi gang rape that caused national outrage, tech giant Microsoft launched Guardian, an Indian-specific women\u2019s safety app that allows users to share their location with contacts in real time.\n\nIndia\u2019s southern states have taken the lead on this issue. On average, the south of India is more developed than the north and devotes more resources to female education, health and mobility. Data from the 2021-22 Annual Survey of Industries showed that more than two-thirds of all Indian women working in industry were in four southern states: Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. Tamil Nadu alone accounts for nearly half of India\u2019s female workers.\n\n\u201cLabour force participation is higher in southern states \u2014 that is a fact,\u201d says the data journalist Rukmini S.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, these are also the states keenest to attract foreign direct investment, and which are leading the way by promoting solutions for female workers such as safe bus transport and workers\u2019 hostels.\n\nSome Indian companies, including the diversified Tata Group and the consumer goods group Hindustan Unilever, are taking steps to increase female employment.\n\nKapoor, the ILO economist, says that India might start to tackle the problems around supply and demand by creating jobs in the care sector, which would enable new paid jobs \u2014 ones less likely to be endangered by artificial intelligence and automation \u2014\u00a0and free up more women to work.\n\n\u201cThis is something Indian women were traditionally comfortable working in, and it creates decent employment,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also represents an investment in human capital and the productivity of future generations.\u201d\n\nIn Kolkata, meanwhile, both female and male trainee doctors at RG Kar are still on strike, defying orders to return to work except in emergencies. \u201cOur parents say they must sit with us in the hospital, especially on night shifts, because authorities aren\u2019t doing enough,\u201d says Shreya Shaw, a spokesperson.\n\nNearly two months later and despite five arrests, Abhaya\u2019s case remains unsolved and still under investigation, which has intensified pressure on the authorities.\n\nAddressing the nation on independence day a few days after the murder, Modi condemned \u201catrocities\u201d against women. Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal state, where the crime occurred, and India\u2019s most powerful female politician, said the accused should be hanged. Yet even she has been attacked by figures in Modi\u2019s rival Bharatiya Janata party and others, who accused her of responding too slowly.\n\nThe protesters are not budging from their demands. The first of these is justice: they want the culprits who murdered Abhaya punished. Initial rumours suggested a case of suicide, and there was an unusual delay in filing a police report on the case, says Shaw. \u201cWe had the suspicion that something was not right.\u201d\n\nThe protesters are also demanding that Kolkata\u2019s commissioner of police resign, along with those responsible at the medical college (the former principal has been arrested on charges of evidence-tampering). As well as enhanced safety measures on the campus, including CCTV cameras and more security personnel, they also want more places where women can rest during and after shifts. \u201cThere are restrooms, but they are not sufficient and not adequate for women,\u201d Shaw says.\n\nShayamadra, the medical student, says that, even if even the numbers of women in paid work have increased in India, for far too long life \u201chas been hard\u201d for anyone wanting a career.\n\n\u201cEven though the numbers are going up, the changes are happening at a very superficial level,\u201d she says. \u201cI am hoping society will truly change in the future.\u201d\n\nData visualisation by Aditi Bhandari", "tag": "india?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/eb034596-406d-439f-8c3d-c884d7a9e633"}, {"uuid4": "8934abd9-3ce5-449e-894e-50562e994e98", "title": "BofA suspends bankers following probe into Asian stock offerings", "description": "An internal investigation is examining whether executives tipped off certain investors of upcoming secondary offerings", "author": "Kaye Wiggins", "published_date": "2024-09-27T18:10:19.069Z", "content": "Bank of America has placed two bankers in India on administrative leave as part of an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing in the US financial giant\u2019s Asian investment bank, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe internal investigation, which was launched earlier this year following a whistleblower complaint, is probing whether BofA and bankers in its Asian operations had tipped off certain investors of upcoming secondary offerings, allowing those investors to \u201cfront run\u201d the stock sales and profit from nonpublic information.\n\nA spokesperson for BofA declined to comment.

In August, central bank governor Shaktikanta Das reiterated his concern about the continued growth of loans \u201cmostly for consumption purposes\u201d.\n\nIndian household debt is accelerating, though it remains low in comparison to developed countries. The country\u2019s household debt to GDP hit a record high of 40 per cent in the most recent financial year ending in March, according to economists at financial services group Motilal Oswal. Personal disposable income in India has not kept pace with the country\u2019s broader economic expansion and net financial savings were at a four-decade low last year, according to the Mumbai-based group.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts said in August that there were \u201crising concerns of deterioration in asset quality\u201d in India, warning that the continued growth in unsecured loans \u201chas led to significant over-leveraging of some households\u201d.\n\nRegulators have started trying to address the rise in delinquencies. In November last year, the RBI said lenders had to increase the risk weight, the minimum amount of capital they must hold in relation to the asset, for personal loans from 100 per cent to 125 per cent.\n\n\u201cRBI is worried about the rising cases of delinquencies at the unsecured borrower level and they want to pre-empt it,\u201d said Abhay Agarwal, founder and fund manager at Indian asset manager Piper Serica in Mumbai, which exited its holdings in the country\u2019s lenders in July.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want the bubble to become so big that when it blows, it hurts the entire financial lending system.\u201d\n\nThe RBI\u2019s moves have helped ease growth in credit card and unsecured personal loans, with the overall pace of retail lending by banks moderating to 14 per cent in July from 31 per cent a year earlier, according to the central bank\u2019s most recent data.\n\nBut Nomura analysts estimate that personal loan delinquencies in India overdue by more than 90 days have increased to 5.1 per cent in the last financial year from 3.9 per cent.\n\nRajeev Jain, chief executive of Bajaj Finance, the country\u2019s largest non-bank lender, told the FT it had been pruning back its own exposure to unsecured lending after it became \u201chot\u201d.\n\n\u201cSupply in a business like credit always finds demand\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009when so many people jump in it leads to some level of exuberance,\u201d Jain said. \u201cWe are watching it carefully to see whether there could be more problems down the road.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s shadow banks are expected to be hit by a rise in delinquencies of between 30 to 50 basis points in the year through to March 2025, resulting in increased credit costs, according to ICRA, an Indian rating agency owned by Moody\u2019s Ratings.\n\n\u201cThey had a great time post-Covid,\u201d said Agarwal, referring to the lending sector. \u201cBut that party is now over.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0665c6d4-9a24-4a5c-8bb5-82b57c1bb9c4"}, {"uuid4": "c7575523-84a9-41e0-b45a-f9f0ea0f8406", "title": "Chess: India win Olympiad gold as new generation dominates in Budapest", "description": "Puzzle: find the win that the world No 3 missed", "author": "Leonard Barden", "published_date": "2024-09-23T12:07:21.846Z", "content": "A new generation is taking over at the top of world chess.

That implies roughly 131 tonnes of bullion imports, the sixth-highest total on record by volume, according to a preliminary estimate from consultancy Metals Focus.\n\nThe high gold price \u2014 which is up by one-quarter since the start of the year \u2014 has traditionally deterred price-sensitive Asian buyers, with Indians reducing demand for gold jewellery in response.\n\nBut the Indian government cut import duties on gold by 9 percentage points at the end of July, triggering a renewed surge in demand in the world\u2019s second-largest buyer of gold.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the duty cut was unprecedented, it was incredible,\u201d said Philip Newman, managing director of Metals Focus in London. \u201cIt really brought consumers in.\u201d\n\nThe tariff cut has been a boon for Indian jewellery stores such as MK Jewels in the upmarket Mumbai suburb of Bandra West, where director Ram Raimalani said \u201cdemand has been fantastic\u201d.\n\nCustomers were packed into the store browsing for necklaces and bangles on a recent afternoon, and Raimalani is expecting an annual sales boost of as much as 40 per cent during the multi-month festival and wedding season that runs from September to February.\n\nRaimalani praised India\u2019s government and \u201cModi ji\u201d, an honorific for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for reducing gold duties.\n\nExpectations of rapid interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve have been the main driver of gold\u2019s huge rally this year, according to analysts. Lower borrowing costs increase the attraction of assets with no yield, such as bullion, and are also likely to weigh on the dollar, in which gold is denominated.\n\nThe Fed cut rates by half a per cent on Wednesday, pushing gold to yet another record high, just below $2,600.\n\nBut strong demand for gold jewellery and bars, as well as buying by central banks, have also helped buoy prices.\n\nIndia accounted for about a third of gold jewellery demand last year, and has become the world\u2019s second-largest bar and coin market, according to data from the World Gold Council, an industry body.\n\nHowever, that demand has meant that domestic gold prices in India are quickly catching up to the level they were at before the tariff duty cut, according to Harshal Barot, senior research consultant at Metals Focus.\n\n\u201cThat entire benefit [of the tariff cut] has kind of vanished,\u201d said Barot. \u201cNow that prices are going up again, we will have to see if consumers still buy as usual.\u201d\n\nJewellery buying had been flagging before the cut in import duty, with demand in India in the first half of 2024 at its lowest level since 2020, according to the World Gold Council.\n\nIndia\u2019s central bank has also been on a gold buying spree, adding 42 tonnes of gold to its reserves during the first seven months of the year \u2014 more than double its purchases for the whole of 2023.\n\nA person familiar with the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s thinking called the gold purchases a \u201croutine\u201d part of its foreign exchange reserve and currency stability management.\n\nIn China, the world\u2019s biggest physical buyer of gold, high prices have meant fewer jewellery sales, but more sales of gold bars and coins, which surged 62 per cent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier.\n\n\u201cWe observed strong positive correlation between gold investment demand and the gold price,\u201d wrote the World Gold Council, referring to China.\n\nAll of this has helped support the physical market and mitigate the impact that high prices can have in eroding demand.\n\n\u201cIt acts as a stable foundation for demand,\u201d said Paul Wong, a market strategist at Sprott Asset Management. \u201cIn parts of Asia, gold is readily convertible into currency,\u201d making it popular for savings, he said.\n\nWestern investor demand has also been a big factor in bullion\u2019s rally, with a net $7.6bn flowing into gold-backed exchange traded funds over the past four months.\n\nAfter hitting a fresh high on Wednesday, analysts warn there could be a correction in the gold price.\n\n\u201cWhen you have this scale of anticipation [of rate cuts], for this long, there is room for disappointment,\u201d said Adrian Ash, London-based director of research at BullionVault, an online gold marketplace. \u201cI think there is scope for a pullback in precious alongside other assets.\u201d\n\nWhether or not gold pulls back from its record highs, Indian jewellery demand looks set to remain strong through the coming wedding season, according to MK Jewels\u2019 Raimalani.\n\nSoaring prices of bullion have been no deterrent to his customers, he added. \u201cIndians are the happiest when prices go high because they already own so much gold.

Some $38bn of domestic money has flowed into Indian equities this year, exceeding the annual level of each of the past 16 years.\n\nIndian companies have rushed to take advantage of the country\u2019s soaring stock markets, with Ola Electric and mortgage provider Bajaj Housing Finance among the biggest initial public offerings so far this year.\n\nMore than $38bn has been raised on its equity market this year, the highest in Asia and more than double the amount over the same period a year ago, Dealogic data shows.\n\nEarlier this month the free float of Indian stocks also supplanted Chinese counterparts as the largest country in the MSCI Emerging Markets investable index, at 22 per cent to 19 per cent.\n\nWhen not adjusted for free float, China remains ahead of India in the closely watched MSCI Emerging Markets index, which does not include small-cap companies. But China has seen its share fall from 40 per cent in 2020 to a quarter while India\u2019s has risen to a fifth from below 7 per cent 10 years ago.\n\nEven so, China and India, and emerging markets as a whole, are still overshadowed by the bull run in US stocks, which make up two-thirds of the world index.

Narendra Modi\u2019s government has since confirmed she is in India, but is declining to say more. That has not stopped tongues from wagging.\n\nWith various degrees of credibility, members of India\u2019s chattering classes have privately claimed that the deposed strongwoman is in an Indian government safe house; staying with her daughter Saima Wazed, who took a Delhi-based regional job with the World Health Organisation in February; or has even been glimpsed strolling with her entourage around one of the capital\u2019s poshest parks, Lodhi Garden.\n\nThe Modi government, Hasina\u2019s top foreign backer when her Awami League party ran Bangladesh, is maintaining a decorous silence on the topic. Delhi\u2019s local and foreign press have mostly stopped pretending they will get Hasina\u2019s first post-overthrow interview.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this.\u00a0Muhammad Yunus\u2019s acting government, which took power after Hasina was toppled, has accused her of responsibility for hundreds of killings during the past summer\u2019s unrest. India and Bangladesh have an extradition treaty \u2014 signed by Hasina\u2019s own government in 2013 \u2014 which could in theory be used against her should the new regime seek her arrest.\n\n\u201cAccording to the extradition agreement with India, we may demand her extradition to Bangladesh,\u201d Asif Nazrul, minister of law, justice and parliamentary affairs in Yunus\u2019s interim cabinet, tells the Financial Times. \u201cFor now, we expect India not to allow her to instigate instability in Bangladesh, which she is trying to do by spreading lies and misinformation.\u201d\n\nFollowing recent press reports relaying controversial remarks attributed to Hasina, Yunus himself said (in words that in turn ruffled some in the Indian establishment): \u201cIf India wants to keep her until the time Bangladesh wants her back, the condition would be that she has to keep quiet.\u201d\n\nIndia has a history of offering refuge to fleeing regional leaders. The Dalai Lama settled in India after fleeing the Chinese takeover of Tibet in 1959. Though he has handed over political affairs to a civilian exile administration (also based in India), the Tibetan spiritual leader recently received a US Congressional delegation, a move that riled Beijing and which analysts say would not have taken place without the Modi government\u2019s assent.\n\nAfghan leader Mohammad Najibullah\u2019s family fled to India in 1992, where his wife Fatana Najib and children still reportedly spend much of their time. (They keep a low profile; Najibullah himself was kept from fleeing and, after years sheltering in a UN compound, was killed and strung from a traffic light pole by the Taliban as they swept into Kabul\u00a0in 1996).\n\nHasina herself, along with her sister Sheikh Rehana, took refuge in India for several years after 1975, when their father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of their family were murdered in Dhaka in a coup. \u201cThere has been a host of precedents of leaders coming to India from the neighbourhood,\u201d says Shivshankar Menon, a former foreign secretary and national security adviser under Manmohan Singh\u2019s government. \u201cWe have always allowed them to stay, and in most cases they respect our wishes that they stay clear of political activity.\u201d\n\nHasina is widely supported across the Indian political spectrum, where she is seen as a bulwark against Islamist extremism, and remembered with respect for her late father\u2019s pivotal role in Bangladesh\u2019s 1971 war of independence, in which Indira Gandhi\u2019s government supported the winning side, at huge human cost.\n\nThe theory that Hasina\u2019s ousting and Yunus\u2019s installation as acting prime minister was a \u201ccolour revolution\u201d or a regime change backed by the US, which supported Pakistan in 1971, has broad currency in India, and not just in pro-Modi circles.\n\nThe sensitivities of Hasina\u2019s sojourn in India, say analysts, also mean a cloak of discretion is likely to surround her whereabouts for now \u2014 and by New Delhi\u2019s design.\n\n\u201cThese are the problems of intimacy, and things are delicate when it comes to our neighbours,\u201d says Menon. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re dealing with countries on the other side of the world.\u201d\n\njohn.reed@ft.com", "tag": "india?page=5", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/06d1339f-6b8e-414a-bdde-38eb426dc293"}, {"uuid4": "3fd00f33-7732-46a7-b7a0-27d0d82f2690", "title": "The FT foreign correspondents\u2019 guide to business dining around the world ", "description": "The top tables for breaking bread and sealing deals in great global cities ", "author": "Adrienne Klasa", "published_date": "2024-09-18T04:00:49.183Z", "content": "This article is part of FT Globetrotter\u2019s guide to power dining\n\nWhile the pull of the West End remains strong, the banks, law firms and other offices around the Square Mile are increasingly flocking to a reinvigorated Farringdon, where Mayfair\u2019s asset managers can now blast in from Bond Street along the Elizabeth Line.

Longer-running establishments remain perennially popular too: St John, the nose-to-tail pioneer (it celebrates its 30th anniversary this year) might as well be one neighbouring law firm\u2019s staff canteen; Quality Chop House (and its confit potatoes) needs no introduction; and Luca, with its Michelin-starred Italian fare and excellent wine list, offers ample temptation to test the limits of the company card.\u2014 Niki Blasina, deputy editor, FT Globetrotter\n\nSydney\u2019s restaurant scene often takes a back seat to the foodie hub of Melbourne, but the Emerald City has plenty of hotspots for business lunches, including the burger and steak stalwart Rockpool Bar & Grill and newcomer Shell House, with its louche dining room and impressive terrace. Yet the \u201ctop end\u201d of Sydney has started to show its more modish side in recent years, with places such as modern Cantonese-style restaurant Mr Wong providing an alternative to the leather-seated comfort of more traditional business hotspots. Mr Wong, hidden down an alleyway near Circular Quay, is a bustling two-storey affair and is the marque restaurant run by the Merivale company, a 1960s fashion house turned hospitality business, that has opened most of the trendiest places in town. Mr Wong is an energetic place with the kitchen operating in full view of the tables upstairs and Peking ducks artfully displayed in rows.

But this summer\u2019s favoured haunt of Eurocrat expense accounts has been Portuguese relative newcomer Puro, for cod and vinho verde to wash down the diplomatic gossip. Located in a space formerly inhabited by a dive bar of undistinguished reputation yards from the EU\u2019s car-park-esque HQ, Puro leans heavily into seafood and Portuguese tradition (even if the caricature\u00a0pen portraits of Cristiano Ronaldo and Eus\u00e9bio on the walls are a bit\u00a0much). Brussels\u2019 Portuguese community is long-standing, and you can find their kitchens on every corner in some parts of the city\u2019s now-hip St Gilles neighbourhood, but Puro is the first to take a stab at the EU bubble. Like most of its rivals, it understands that crowd\u2019s penchant for a two-course, one-hour, half-a-bottle approach to lunch.

However, the venue \u2014\u00a0co-owned by founder Enrico Buonocore and the Moncler-controlling Ruffini family \u2014 has an extra ingredient that makes it particularly appealing to business people and big spenders: the cool factor, which is reflected in everything from the design and the bar to\u00a0the endless wine list. It recently opened in Paris and has other locations in St Moritz and Portofino.

Its menu offers the usual Italian fare and wine that would win a nonna\u2019s approval. The pizzas are a must-have. In a city with limited high-quality dining options and a constant search for the next big thing, it\u2019s no surprise the well-heeled throng to Farfallino.

Trailblazers such as Michelin-starred Seven Swans, with its plant-based menu made from seasonal and regionally sourced roots and leaves (and chic neighbouring cocktail bar The Tiny Cup, located in the narrowest building in Frankfurt), set the stage for this shift more than a decade ago. Now, newcomers such as the hip, tapas-inspired Leuchtendroter and the (aesthetically\u00a0at least) more traditionally German Hohenheim & S\u00f6hne are joining the scene, turning Frankfurt into an unexpected hotspot for inventive vegan cuisine \u2014 a vibrant counterpoint to its traditional culinary tapestry.\u2014 Patricia Nilsson, Frankfurt\u00a0correspondent\n\nIn Brazil\u2019s financial capital, a gastronomic hub has emerged in the past few years on Rua Ferreira de Ara\u00fajo, in the Pinheiros neighbourhood. The street is a 10-15 minute drive from the big banks and investment firms on Avenida Faria Lima, the nation\u2019s version of Wall Street. Among its dozens of restaurants and bars, there\u2019s Italian at Pi\u00f9, Modern Mamma Osteria (MOMA) and Tartuferia, which specialises in dishes with truffles.\u00a0Canto do Picu\u00ed offers cuisine from the north-eastern Brazilian state of Alagoas.

Stuck in Midtown? Try the classic Casa Lever, a space-age cathedral with your choice of private booth or main-floor dining, which is best known for its crudos and osso bucco alla Milanese. Venturing downtown, dine at the recently opened Roscioli in SoHo. The tasting menu of Roman delights or cacio e pepe will bring you back to the restaurant\u2019s origins in Campo dei Fiori in the heart of Italy\u2019s capital. Seafood perhaps? Then Santi may be worth the wait.

This grand dame of the Zurich restaurant scene survives all attempts of flashier, more on-trend, more novel, more \u2014 frankly \u2014 delicious restaurants to unseat it. Perhaps because, with its starchy but friendly mix of formality and egalitarianism, its heavy r\u00f6stis and cream sauces on the table, thick china plates below Mir\u00f3s on the wall (and Braques and Chagalls and Bonnards), its intimacy and its openness (they\u2019ll get you in if they can), not to mention its epic timelessness, it is as if this restaurant is mainlining Z\u00fcrchers ur-conception of self and Swissness.\n\nEveryone is here. (Everyone who has of course, vaulted the high financial bar of this most expensive to live in or visit of cities.) Eating here is like being on the Orient Express of old, in the Christie conception, only without the murder. The dark wood and brass and the booths of the downstairs \u201cbrasserie\u201d room add to the sense of a wagon-lit. But what really does it is the cast of fellow diners: princesses and swindlers and bank CEOs and DJs and ruby-wedding celebrants down from the mountains and jobbing poets and you. \u201cCeci n\u2019est pas un mus\u00e9e,\u201d the restaurant declares on its website, paraphrasing Magritte with a wink.

Others head to international Asian chains such as Hakkasan and Yauatcha. But more restaurants have drawn the after-work crowd with less-bloating modern takes on Indian or fusion-type\u00a0cuisine.\u00a0A powerful Mumbai corporate lawyer recommends the recently opened Ode in Worli, whose menu including pizza and spiced buffalo tenderloin draws on the Maharashtrian and European heritage of\u00a0Rahul Akerkar,\u00a0one of the city\u2019s most renowned chefs.\u00a0More established favourites include the nearby Bombay Canteen and its sibling restaurant O Pedro in the glitzy BKC district, known for their seasonal and Goan delicacies. \u2014 Chris Kay, Mumbai correspondent\n\nThe exquisite demands of Madrid\u2019s power lunchers have helped make the city a global gastronomic hub, and today the business crowd flocks to Calle de Jorge Juan in the chichi Salamanca neighbourhood, a narrow thoroughfare of towering trees and whitewashed apartments, its terraces bubbling over with conviviality. Celebrity chef Dani Garc\u00eda does seafood at Lobito de Mar. Amaz\u00f3nico is a jungle-themed place with a gonzo playfulness.

It is stone\u2019s throw from Lazard and Morgan Stanley, so bankers abound. Le Bristol for breakfast (the fruits rouges are a delight, if wildly pricey) and for drinks in the evening \u2014 the martinis are among the city\u2019s best. Matsuhisa\u2019s Japanese-Peruvian\u00a0fusion in Le Royal Monceau-Raffles Paris is a welcome reprieve when you\u2019ve had your fill of beef and butter, and the airy setting\u00a0allows for privacy. Au Petit Riche (ninth arrondissement) is an institution for a reason, and everything you could wish for in a classic French restaurant. Across the river, Ja\u00efs (seventh arrondissement) offers a lobster salad worth crossing the city for and is heavily frequented by Left Bank lawyers. Finally, if you want to\u00a0impress with your cultural nous, Ogata\u2019s immaculate Japanese set menus in the Marais should help you close the deal.\u00a0\u2014 Adrienne Klasa, Paris correspondent\n\nRome is beloved for its classic pastas, from amatriciana to cacio e pepe, but it can be rather hard to go back to work after partaking of such rich fare. Hence the popularity of Ginger Sapori e Saluti, with its health-conscious menu focusing on seasonal organic ingredients.\u00a0Roman ladies who lunch and business diners flock here for its gourmet panini and generous salads laden with Italian treats such as Parma ham, fresh buffalo mozzarella and Parmigiano Reggiano; Ginger\u2019s own take on more classic fare including pastas, grilled meats and burgers; and more unexpected offerings such as a quinoa or tuna poke bowl. Vegetarians and vegans are well catered for, while fresh fruit smoothies are an antidote to the typical Italian carb overdose. Don\u2019t miss the amazing vegan raspberry cheesecake, even if you aren\u2019t a vegan. Ginger has expanded to three prime sites in the historic centre, the latest of which opened a year ago in the courtyard of an 18th-century palazzo.\n\nThose searching for greater tradition can opt for the old Roman favourite Ciampini \u2014 in the nearby Piazza di San Lorenzo in Lucina \u2014 where Italian political power brokers famously go to see and be seen, as much as for the food.\u00a0\u2014 Amy Kazmin, Rome correspondent\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite city for business dining?

Fabiano Caruana, the world No2, began in fine form but Hikaru Nakamura, the No3, already has Olympiad gold from 2016 so gave priority to his streaming\u00a0career, while Hans Niemann\u2019s results surge in recent weeks came too late for the team selection. Four of the five Americans previously played in Olympiads for other nations.\n\nBanned Russia is absent, while\u00a0China, which won gold on its last appearance, has been handicapped by the continuing\u00a0poor form of Ding Liren, the reigning world champion, who began with a series of four tame draws and a loss while\u00a0his challenger\u00a0Gukesh started with four wins and a draw.\u00a0India\u2019s fast improving world No 4 Arjun Erigaisi is the only player to win all six games.\n\nAfter six (of 11) rounds on Tuesday\u2019s rest day, India\u00a0leads the open Olympiad with a maximum 12 points, followed by Vietnam, China and Iran with 11. If both field their best teams, India v China on Wednesday will\u00a0be a preview of\u00a0 the Ding v Gukesh world title match.\u00a0England is 10th\u00a0with 10 points, but has yet to meet any of the leaders.\n\nIndia leads\u00a0the women\u2019s Olympiad with 12 points, followed by Georgia and Poland with 11.\u00a0England is 28th with nine.

A SAR is a temporary measure designed to keep services running, and suppliers and staff paid, in the event of a corporate collapse.\n\n\u201cWe are ready now, we could do one [SAR} today, if we had to,\u201d said one official. \u201cIncidentally, being ready for a SAR is also the strongest lever that we as government can have to make sure that another market-led, private-led solution is found.\u201d\n\nThames Water is struggling under its \u00a319bn debt pile and has warned that it will run out of cash in March unless the High Court signs off a controversial \u00a33bn loan at a hearing in early February.\n\nAnother government official said that there had been \u201cinformal engagement\u201d with certain consultancies over a special administrator role but no formal interview process.\n\nSteve Reed, the environment secretary, said in October that he had \u201cruled out nationalisation\u201d.\n\nOfficials insist that taking the company into SAR would not technically be a nationalisation despite it being a big state intervention.\n\nBut plunging Thames Water into special administration may be unavoidable if the court blocks the loan agreed with its senior creditors, or if the company runs out of cash earlier\u00a0than expected. The \u00a33bn loan is controversial because it would carry an interest rate of 9.75 per cent as well as fees and incentives for the existing Thames Water management.\n\nThe agreement is being challenged by a separate group of Thames Water\u2019s junior creditors \u2014 which have proposed a cheaper deal \u2014 and by environmental campaigners who argue that the company would be better off in special administration.\n\nThe loan would buy the company time to raise at least \u00a33bn of equity in a parallel process. Companies including Castle Water, Covalis and CKI Infrastructure are among investment groups lining up to put in potential bids for the utility.\n\nBidders and creditors are waiting to see if the company appeals to the Competition and Markets Authority over regulator Ofwat\u2019s decision last month on the level by which water companies can hike customer bills over the next five years. Thames Water has not yet made a decision whether to appeal Ofwat\u2019s decision to the CMA, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nOfwat has said that Thames will be allowed to raise bills 35 per cent \u2014 much lower than the 59 per cent increase it had sought \u2014 taking average bills from around \u00a3436 now to \u00a3588 between now and 2030.\n\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Thames Water and Ofwat did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\nEY, Teneo and Interpath declined to comment.\n\nIn an update to the market on Wednesday, the company\u2019s chief restructuring officer, Julian Gething, said: \u201cOur plan delivers for customers and stakeholders by unlocking up to \u00a33bn of new money and securing a total of \u00a33.5bn of debt maturity extensions over the next two years and cash releases, so we can continue investing the billions of pounds required to improve our network\u2019s resilience.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is the only implementable solution to enable the equity investment required to provide stability and certainty in the longer term and will not impact customer bills.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s choice of administrator may be complicated by potential conflicts of interest. Teneo is already an adviser to Thames Water and has received \u00a35mn in fees since August 2023. It had also received at least \u00a360mn from running the special administration of collapsed energy supplier Bulb, according to the National Audit Office.\n\nIt has also written a report to the High Court supporting the senior creditors\u2019 \u00a33bn loan, while\u00a0Interpath has written a separate report on behalf of the junior creditors.\n\nSir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at Oxford university, has argued that a SAR would enable Thames Water to focus on a restructuring and on delivering improvements, rather than on negotiating a deal with creditors.", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/23bd3059-c569-4d05-9f1e-32cebbd03fa6"}, {"uuid4": "c4c53a0e-e2d4-4fb6-a66c-c2c7d1cbb3ff", "title": "Southport killer sentenced to at least 52 years in prison", "description": "Judge says \u2018highly likely\u2019 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana will \u2018never be released\u2019 ", "author": "Jennifer Williams", "published_date": "2025-01-23T17:10:36.525Z", "content": "A teenager has been handed one of the longest jail terms in UK history for the \u201csadistic\u201d and \u201cmeticulously planned\u201d murder of three small children in Southport last July.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 18, was sentenced to life with a minimum of 52 years in prison on Thursday after admitting to the murder of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Da Silva Aguiar, nine, at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class.\n\nHe had also pleaded guilty to 10 attempted murders, as well as possession of an al-Qaeda training manual and the toxic substance ricin.\n\nAfter time already served, the minimum sentence was 51 years and 190 days. Sentencing, Mr Justice Goose said: \u201cIt is highly likely that he will never be released.\u201d\n\nRudakubana is said to have shown no remorse since the attacks six months ago, which prompted riots across the country and questions about how authorities failed to spot multiple warning signs about his behaviour.\n\nLiverpool Crown Court heard that he had gloated about the killings at a police station after his arrest, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing those children are dead\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009so glad\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009so happy.\u201d\n\nThe court heard harrowing details about the attack itself, and that Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time, had planned his rampage for several weeks beforehand.\n\nSix minutes before leaving his house at 11.10am on Monday, July 29, he searched the social media platform X for footage of a terror attack that had taken place in Australia a few months earlier, in which the bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel was stabbed at a church in Sydney.\n\nDoorbell footage then shows him pacing up and down outside his house with his hood up.\n\nArmed with a 20cm kitchen knife, he caught a taxi to the workshop in the Hart Space centre, Southport, where 26 children had gathered to dance, sing and make friendship bracelets.\n\nThe court heard that Rudakubana went upstairs to the class and 30 seconds later began stabbing children wordlessly.\n\nHe stabbed some victims in the back as they tried to escape. Alongside the three murdered children, eight other children and two adults were also injured.\n\nPolice found Rudakubana silently standing over a child\u2019s body on the landing, still holding the kitchen knife he had used to carry out the attack.\n\nLater searches of the house he shared with his parents in Banks, Lancashire, uncovered a machete, a set of arrows, bottles with matches attached, and an Apollo Cerbera knife identical to the one used in the attack. Both knives had been bought on Amazon on July 13, using a virtual private network to encrypt his internet address.\n\nPolice also found a plastic box containing a \u201cpulp\u201d-like substance under his bed. Tests by the UK government laboratory Porton Down confirmed it to be the deadly substance ricin, which he had made in his bedroom.\n\nPolice also seized 43 electronic devices from his home, 32 of which they were able to access.\n\nWhile his internet search history had mostly been deleted, they uncovered more than 164,000 downloaded documents spanning a vast range of extreme violent imagery and information. Subject matter included beheadings, genocides, wars in Iraq, Rwanda, Gaza and Sudan, and images of weapons.\n\nRudakubana had also downloaded an academic paper containing an excerpt from an al-Qaeda training manual.\n\nMr Justice Goose concluded that Rudakubana had followed the instructions it contained in order to carry out the killings.\n\n\u201cI am satisfied that for some time, he had planned to kill as many people as he could,\u201d he said, adding that anyone who had heard the evidence in the case \u201cwould describe what he did as evil\u201d.\n\nMerseyside chief constable Serena Kennedy said the murders had amounted to a \u201csadistic\u201d rampage carried out by a teenager with an \u201cunhealthy fascination with violence\u201d.\n\n\u201cHaving researched atrocities committed by others, the evidence suggests that he set out to emulate them on July 29,\u201d she said, adding that there was no evidence he ascribed to \u201cany particular political or religious ideology\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t fighting for a cause,\u201d she said. \u201cHis only purpose was to kill and he targeted the youngest, most vulnerable in order to spread the greatest level of fear and outrage, which he succeeded in doing.\u201d\n\nRudakubana \u2014 who had been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and had been known to children\u2019s and mental health services, as well as the anti-extremism programme Prevent \u2014 said nothing in formal police interviews.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s hearing Rudakubana shouted over the prosecutor and demanded to see a paramedic.\n\nThe court heard he had stopped eating while on remand. He was taken away for medical checks and did not return to court, after promising to continue disrupting proceedings.\n\nThe attack last July helped to spark a wave of riots across the UK, including in the Merseyside town of Southport itself, after misinformation spread online that the attacker was an illegal immigrant.\n\nRudakubana, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan immigrants, was not charged with an act of terror, although he was convicted of possessing terror-related material. Police and prosecutors said that current legislation did not allow for a terror charge due to Rudakubana\u2019s apparent lack of ideology.\n\nThey said there was no evidence he had been working with others, or of activity in online chats or forums.\n\nHowever, he had been known to the government\u2019s anti-extremism programme Prevent, to whom he was referred three times between 2019 and 2021.\n\nOn the first occasion, in November 2019, he was referred by his school after searching for information on school shootings during an information technology class.\n\nIn February 2021, he was referred after a fellow pupil raised concerns over his Instagram posts about former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi. Two months later he was referred by a teacher who noted he had two tabs open on his computer about the London Bridge terror attacks of 2017.\n\nIn each case, the programme took no further action, noting a lack of overriding ideology.\n\nAhead of the sentencing Vicki Evans, senior national co-ordinator for Counter Terrorism Policing, said the Prevent programme\u2019s understanding of such extremism had still been \u201cevolving\u201d at the time.\n\nEarlier this week Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced a public inquiry into the killings, as well as a review of the Prevent programme.\n\nLancashire police were contacted five times about Rudakubana between 2019 and 2022.\n\nIn March 2022, he went missing and was found by police in possession of a knife. He told officers that he wanted to stab someone and had thought about poisoning people.\n\nRudakubana had also been convicted under the youth justice system after attacking a fellow pupil with a hockey stick in 2019. He had taken a knife into school 10 times previously.\n\nLancashire police said prior to sentencing that it had reviewed each of its call-outs to Rudakubana but could not discuss the details further, due to the forthcoming public inquiry.\n\nIn court, victims and their families read out harrowing accounts of the impact last July\u2019s attack had on their lives.\n\nLeanne Lucas, who had organised the dance class in Southport, was stabbed by Rudakubana and helped many of the children escape.\n\n\u201cAs a 36-year-old woman,\u201d she said, \u201cI cannot walk down the street without holding my breath as I bypass a person and then glance back to see if they\u2019ve attempted to stab me.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/667cd691-79ee-45aa-8002-1ab88cc428ec"}, {"uuid4": "2c36769a-932f-4770-989c-ae64f90b4853", "title": "The UK begins to shift the narrative on growth", "description": "Also in this week\u2019s newsletter: why exports are the drivers of economic expansion", "author": "Peter Foster", "published_date": "2025-01-23T17:01:55.275Z", "content": "Good afternoon. It\u2019s been hard to know where to look this week, what with the second Trump administration\u2019s opening salvo on taxes and tariffs alongside Rachel Reeves\u2019 increasingly aggressive demands on regulators to deliver growth, but I choose the home front.\n\nThe ousting of Marcus Bokkerink as chair of the Competition and Markets Authority on Tuesday evening \u2014 pour encourager les autres \u2014 was part of a concerted attempt by the government to shift the narrative on growth.\n\nReeves let it be known that growth \u2014 including potentially expanding Gatwick and Luton airports and adding a third runway at Heathrow \u2014 must trump all other priorities, including the drive to net zero.\n\nAt the same time, the government announced the next raft of planning reforms, including establishing a \u2018Nature Restoration Fund\u2019 where developers can pay into a pot for projects that offset the damage caused by developments.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, there are already complaints and objections from this apparently gung-ho approach, including from backbench Labour MPs who are reportedly \u201cholding their heads in despair\u201d at the sight of a Labour chancellor pedalling a Tory narrative on deregulation.\n\nBut I suspect Reeves won\u2019t mind that too much, because there really is a need to change the narrative \u2014 not just of this government, which has had a wretchedly flat-footed beginning, but of the entire post-Brexit period.\n\nTurning the page, telling a story\n\nLast week Labour Together, the party\u2019s in-house think-tank, published a timely report setting out how post-Brexit UK needs to get its mojo back, in a \u201cmore dangerous and competitive world\u201d, as evidenced this week by Trump\u2019s return to the White House.\n\nThe report\u2019s author, Jonathan McClory of strategy firm Sanctuary Counsel, assembled a panel of UK and international diplomats, academics and investors to create a semi-structured focus group to try to identify a new way forward.\n\nEven though none were asked specifically about Brexit, almost all brought it up. This is not about trade barriers, per se, but about the reputational damage caused to the UK as a place to do business and the failure to build a compelling new national narrative outside the EU.\n\nAs one interviewee noted:\n\n\u201cThe chaotic political handling of Brexit has left an impression of a country that doesn\u2019t know what it wants, doesn\u2019t have the capacity to think about its interests, and is consumed by slogans rather than strategy\u201d.\n\nThree other key takeaways: firstly, the UK interviewees were gloomier than the international ones, which tells you that too much self-flagellation over Brexit is counterproductive. As Sir Keir Starmer keeps saying, \u201cwe need to move on\u201d. But it\u2019s actions that matter, not words.\n\nSecondly, that the UK\u2019s future softpower advantage should be centred on \u201cscience, technology, and innovation\u201d \u2014 AI, green technology, bioengineering \u2014 at least as much as traditional cultural advantages.\n\nThis is not to dismiss our traditional values around history \u2014 the UK invented most of the world\u2019s sports, for example \u2014 and we\u2019re good at the flummery that comes with an active royal family. But in this new ground zero world of AI, rampant tech, pandemics and climate change, the argument is that \u201cit\u2019s time to move on\u201d.\n\nAnd thirdly, and most importantly, that the rebirth starts at home. We can tie ourselves in knots over the \u2018EU reset\u2019 and how to handle Donald Trump (\u201cHeaven help us\u201d, as one senior government insider put it to me this week) but the foundations that need fixing first are here.\n\nAs another interviewee said, \u201cThe UK needs to put its domestic affairs in order first,\u201d adding, encouragingly: \u201conce [the UK] manages that, it could really be a leader on many of the areas the global community is struggling with.\u201d\n\nSaying is not doing, but it\u2019s a start\n\nObviously, putting domestic affairs in order is not just about giving speeches in Davos to please corporate investors, but that\u2019s not a bad place to start if you\u2019re trying to stem the tide of relentlessly negative reactions to a Budget that has weighed on hiring and investment.\n\nThe next step is to join the dots. As a reader pointed out after last week\u2019s newsletter, it sends a powerful signal that Angela Rayner overruled the Environment Agency to green-light a Cambridge housing development last December that had been blocked over water scarcity concerns.\n\nBut that needs to be accompanied by an actual plan to reduce water consumption, release finance for a new water pipeline and, ultimately, deliver a new reservoir after a period of 35 years when the UK has failed to build a single one.\n\nAs well as long-term investment, that requires lining up all the strategic regulators, from Ofwat to the Environment Agency and to actually get it done \u2014 and have it seen to be done. Reeves made a start on that this week.\n\nIt also means, for example, that if you\u2019re going to have an industrial strategy that draws talent from all across the world, prevailing on the Home Office to make visas easier and more plentiful \u2014 and daring to make the political argument why this is necessary.\n\nAnd it means, if you\u2019re going to have a \u2018trade strategy\u2019, actually injecting some urgency and ambition into the EU-UK \u2018reset\u2019 (still not too late), which leads to another argument over immigration and the repeated failure of a homegrown skills strategy.\n\nOr it could mean, according to Chris Southworth at the International Chamber of Commerce, taking aggressive steps to remove what he calls the \u201cover zealous regulation\u201d that makes it so difficult for SMEs in particular to obtain trade finance.\n\nSo while there probably isn\u2019t much in the coming EU \u2018reset\u2019 that will fix things for SMEs who\u2019ve been hammered by Brexit, Southworth argues there are steps \u2014 on access to finance and trade digitisation \u2014 that the UK can do at home to get UK companies exporting.\n\nHe\u2019s not convinced that the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority is going far enough to remove barriers that are a legacy of 9/11 and the 2008 financial crash and are stifling the ability of SMEs to obtain low risk, short-term working capital.\n\n\u201cI would have liked to see far more radical and ambitious ideas such as removing capital requirements for SMEs altogether. This would inject far more confidence into the market that the PRA are getting serious on supporting growth,\u201d he says.\n\nMake no mistake, the mood is pretty grim. But as I heard while chairing the annual Executive Survey for MakeUK, the manufacturing body, this morning, it\u2019s far from terminal if the government can build a compelling narrative for Britain.\n\nBusiness is labouring under heavy additional costs as a result of the Budget but as the CEO of medical products maker Vernacare Alex Hodges said, there is also a well of optimism waiting to be tapped \u2014 they just want the government to lean in a bit.\n\nSo I can think of lots of reasons why various growth-enhancing measures (some examples above) won\u2019t happen; but after making such a desperately low-key start to their term in office, ousting a prominent regulator and promising to \u2018build baby, build\u2019 is at least sending a strong signal that you intend to have a serious go at it.\n\nThis week\u2019s chart comes from a thought-provoking report by the Centre for Cities think-tank which maps the link between places engaged in exporting activities and higher wages and productivity.\n\nThe report uses national data to show that exporting activities are the drivers of UK productivity growth, with sectors like IT, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and finance leading growth since 1997.\n\nThis is because exporting activities, particularly in the new industries, have a \u201cgreater ability to absorb new innovations and use creativity to create value\u201d, and also have greater resilience because they can access more markets and ride out cyclical downturns.\n\nThis is the mechanical link between trade and growth. So as the Centre for Cities chief executive Andrew Carter observes, the report highlights the need \u2014 political constraints aside \u2014 to deepen that relationship as far as possible.\n\n\u201cWe clearly need to have the most advantageous relationship and arrangement with Europe as we can possibly get. There\u2019s the difficult politics of that but the further we move away from the best version of an arrangement, the harder it gets,\u201d he says.\n\nFor all that, the government remains committed to a deeply limited EU \u2018reset\u2019 strategy, hemmed in by its red lines on single market and customs union membership.\n\nWe\u2019ll see if the fallout from Trump leads to a pinking of those red lines in a bid to unlock areas that would help attract investment, via improved access to the UK\u2019s largest export market for both people and goods.\n\nWe are now approaching the point, as the agenda is drawn up for the first EU-UK \u2018reset\u2019 summit in March or April this year, when we\u2019ll start to see how ambitious the UK is prepared to be.\n\nEven keeping to the red lines, there are things to be done: the youth mobility deal (which could bleed into elements of professional mobility), full alignment with the EU\u2019s carbon-markets (to reduce carbon border tax friction) and maybe even some fixes on customs.\n\nOne area that is being flirted with in London is the UK joining the Pan-Euro Mediterranean convention. This is a customs agreement between the EU and 20 countries, including several in the Middle East and the Balkans, where all countries share the same \u2018rules of origin\u2019.\n\nFor now, ministers are officially saying that the UK is not interested, but sectoral analysis and some business consultation is ongoing. Trade minister Douglas Alexander left the door open this week by telling MPs that the convention \u201cis an issue that we are open to looking at\u201d and the UK approach would be \u201cpragmatic\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s not a silver bullet and will do nothing to address regulatory frictions. But if you want to understand the possibilities (and some of the trade-offs) then a paper by Anna Jerzewska of the consultancy Trade & Borders, is a really clear piece of work on a tricky subject.

The tax authority has reported that the policy has been linked to at least 10 suicides and 13 attempted suicides.\n\nLabour committed to a new independent review of the loan charge before the general election last year. A previous report by Lord Amyas Morse in 2019 was criticised by MPs and campaigners for involving Treasury and HMRC officials.\n\nMurray said the government had \u201cgone to some lengths\u201d to ensure public confidence in the review, which will run until the summer and be staffed by civil servants who have no connection with or experience working on loan charge policy. They will work in a building separate to the Treasury.\n\nMcCann, a former president of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said he was \u201cpleased to be asked to help find ways\u201d to resolve the dispute.\n\nMcCann previously criticised how HMRC has sought to engage with loan charge campaigners, noting that \u201call the people [within the agency] who are working on loan schemes could be working on customer service\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, the government said the review would probe \u201cthe barriers preventing those subject to the loan charge from reaching resolution with HMRC and recommend ways in which they can be encouraged to do so\u201d.\n\nCampaigners who have demanded a wide-ranging probe \u2014 looking at the role of scheme developers, umbrella companies, recruitment agencies, accountants and tax advisers who recommended the schemes, as well as HMRC \u2014 hit out at the announcement.\n\nSteve Packham, of the Loan Charge Action Group, said the proposed review was \u201ca betrayal\u201d and would \u201cnot resolve the matter\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply worried about the impact on mental health that the announcement of this sham non-review will have,\u201d he added.\n\nMurray said his meetings with loan charge campaigners last year had alerted him to the policy\u2019s impact and that the government wanted the McCann review, to which it will respond by the autumn Budget, to \u201cprovide a way for taxpayers affected to come to a settlement\u201d.\n\nDespite some asking \u201cfor a review with a different scope\u201d, Murray added that his priority was \u201cto help those people who feel stuck\u201d.", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/274afe7a-c5aa-409b-89e3-4b2c81f5317b"}, {"uuid4": "ffe429d9-828e-4665-82e9-5ffee8425b2c", "title": "UK competition regulator to cut staff after \u2018budgeting error\u2019", "description": "Voluntary exit scheme comes as CMA reels from government\u2019s ousting of its chair", "author": "Suzi Ring", "published_date": "2025-01-23T15:53:01.249Z", "content": "The UK Competition and Markets Authority is planning to cut staff numbers by close to 10 per cent following a \u201cbudgeting error\u201d, as the agency reels from the ousting of its chair by the government.\n\nChief executive Sarah Cardell told staff at a town-hall meeting in December that the CMA was starting a voluntary exit scheme to cut staff numbers by about 100 because of an overspend, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nCardell referred to the overspend as a \u201cbudgeting error\u201d, the people said. The CMA has a total headcount of nearly 1,200 and its budget from the Treasury for this year is \u00a3139mn.\n\nAt another town hall meeting on Monday, Cardell said certain areas of the agency, such as mergers and the new digital markets unit, would be protected from the cuts, the people said.\n\nThe watchdog was seeking to avoid forced job cuts by starting with voluntary departures, one of the people added.\n\nThe cuts come as the regulator has found itself in the Labour government\u2019s crosshairs, with CMA chair Marcus Bokkerink ousted this week by ministers after complaints from business about the regulator.\n\nMinisters wanted to send a signal to the CMA and other independent regulators that the government wanted to prioritise growth, according to officials.\n\nBokkerink\u2019s exit has led antitrust lawyers and lobbyists to question whether the CMA will now take a softer approach towards Big Tech. Bokkerink has been replaced in the interim by former Amazon UK head Doug Gurr.\n\nIn a staff meeting on Thursday, Cardell sought to reassure employees that they did not need to be concerned about Bokkerink\u2019s departure and that the government had given assurances of its confidence in the agency, one person said.\n\nWhile the staff exit scheme was in train before Bokkerink\u2019s ousting, some employees are concerned that in light of the government\u2019s frustration with the agency there could be further staff reductions.\n\nStaff numbers at the antitrust regulator have grown considerably over the past eight years from about 600 staff in 2017 to 1,185 as of October 2024, according to the most recent disclosure.\n\nThe CMA has expanded its presence from London to a number of hubs across the UK. Part of the growth is down to its suite of powers under the new digital markets regime, which came into effect this month, and led to the creation of the digital markets unit at the agency to enforce it.\n\nUnder the new regime, the CMA will designate a number of Big Tech companies with a large presence in certain digital markets as having \u201cstrategic market status\u201d and force them to abide by certain conduct rules.\n\nGoogle and Apple became the first companies this month to face investigations to determine if they should be handed the status.\n\nThe CMA said:\u00a0\u201cThis is an historic budget issue which has been addressed swiftly and appropriately. The CMA is fully focused on its priorities for the coming year including working with the government and the new interim chair to help deliver growth.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury said it was \u201caware of this historic issue and worked with the CMA last year to resolve it\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are now moving forward with the second part of spending review discussions, as we are with all government departments.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2d6b74e6-f5dd-4aaa-af19-91225272c423"}, {"uuid4": "ff8f2452-b6c2-41e0-b025-7fa6189463cf", "title": "Sainsbury\u2019s to cut 3,000 jobs as rising costs hit business", "description": "Supermarket chain will lose a fifth of senior management roles and close in-store caf\u00e9s", "author": "Laura Onita", "published_date": "2025-01-23T14:10:03.473Z", "content": "J Sainsbury is axing 3,000 jobs, including senior managers, as the UK\u2019s second-largest supermarket chain accelerates cost-cutting after the Labour government increased taxes on employers in its\u00a0October\u00a0Budget.\n\nThe redundancies, which amount to 2 per cent of the group\u2019s workforce, will result from the closure of its 61 remaining in-store caf\u00e9s and sweeping changes at management level.\n\nAbout 20 per cent of senior management roles are expected to be axed, Sainsbury\u2019s said on Thursday.\n\nThe decision comes after dozens of large UK retailers, including Sainsbury\u2019s, warned in November that the higher costs arising from the Budget would feed through into job losses and higher prices for customers.\n\nThe move by one of the UK\u2019s biggest private-sector employers will make for awkward timing for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who is meanwhile attempting to woo business leaders and foreign investors at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nMore than half of UK retailers said they would reduce the number of hours for their workers, as well as head-office headcount, according to a survey of finance chiefs earlier this month by the British Retail Consortium.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s job cuts follow an announcement by the company last year that it would cut a further \u00a31bn in costs over the next three years.\n\nThe reorganisation also comes amid what chief executive Simon Roberts called \u201ca particularly challenging cost environment\u201d as retailers battle rising costs and taxes.\n\nThe retail sector has forecast bigger annual costs of up to \u00a37bn, largely stemming from increases in national insurance contributions and the national living wage.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s is facing a \u00a3140mn hit to its tax bill from the Budget. Some of the changes to its workforce were partly driven by this, according to one person familiar with the decision.\n\nIn October, Reeves announced that the rate of employers\u2019 national insurance contributions would rise 1.2 percentage points to 15 per cent from April while the earnings threshold at which the tax kicks in would be reduced from \u00a39,100 to \u00a35,000.\n\nThe minimum wage is also set to rise, adding to employers\u2019 cost pressures.\n\nAndrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThis news from one of Britain\u2019s biggest retailers is devastating but no surprise. Thanks to Labour\u2019s budget 3,000 jobs will be lost and 3,000 families will suffer without the security of regular pay.\u201d\n\nThe grocery chain said it was overhauling the structure of its central management teams \u201cto support faster decision making and drive performance\u201d at both Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos, which is also owned by the group.\n\nThis would lead to fewer, bigger head office roles with clearer accountability, the company said, adding that the changes would take effect in coming months.\n\nRoberts said the business \u201chad to make tough choices about where we can afford to invest and where we need to do things differently to make our business more efficient and effective\u201d.\n\nClive Black, head of consumer research at Shore Capital, said Sainsbury\u2019s had unveiled \u201cfurther, increasingly necessary steps post the autumn Budget, to manage its cost base to enable ongoing investment\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhilst very difficult, such steps are necessary to us, especially in the face of very considerable UK government-sourced cost expansion,\u201d he added.\n\nSeparately, the finance chief of Associated British Foods, which owns fashion chain Primark, warned that consumers were holding back from buying clothes partly because of increasing uncertainty over the security of their jobs.\n\nOn Thursday, the company blamed cautious consumers in its core UK market as it cut Primark\u2019s sales forecast for 2025.\n\nChief financial officer Eoin Tonge said \u201cother businesses \u2014 not us \u2014 start to talk about employment levels and recruitment, and the recruitment of temporary workers\u201d and \u201cthe spectre of unemployment seems to rise\u201d, having a knock-on impact on consumer sentiment.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing, especially in those lower income brackets, consumers being more [selective] around their purchasing habits.\n\n\u201cWe need a different narrative, we need more upbeat, positive, front-foot narrative to get some energy back into the system.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b3217267-f314-42c3-894e-86ae49d0003b"}, {"uuid4": "3d44f191-8f04-4f56-ae5c-19b3f70596af", "title": "Rachel Reeves to soften UK non-dom tax reforms", "description": "Chancellor tells Davos crowd that government had been \u2018listening to concerns\u2019", "author": "Jim Pickard", "published_date": "2025-01-23T13:00:28.354Z", "content": "Rachel Reeves is set to make a change to the UK government\u2019s crackdown on non-domiciled residents in an attempt to allay concerns about the tax reforms announced in October\u2019s Budget.\n\nThe chancellor told a fringe event at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday that the government would soon table an amendment to its own finance bill.\n\nThis will enable easier access to the temporary repatriation facility, which allows non-doms to bring foreign income and gains made before April 2025 into the UK and pay tax at a discounted rate of 12 per cent in the 2025-26 and 2026-27 tax years, rising to 15 per cent in 2027-28 \u2014 compared with the maximum\u00a0income tax rate of 45 per cent.\n\nThe change planned by the government would make it easier for certain funds to access the facility\u2019s flat tax rates. But while the measure may be useful for some non-doms, it is unlikely\u00a0to move the dial for many.\n\nReeves said at The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Davos event on Thursday the government had been \u201clistening to the concerns that have been raised by the non-dom community\u201d, responding to a question about an increase in the net number of millionaires leaving the UK in recent months.\n\nBusiness secretary Jonathan Reynolds later confirmed the planned change, first reported by The Times, telling journalists in the Swiss mountain resort: \u201cThere is a tweak to the finance bill\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009when you\u2019re changing a tax regime, people will want to know, and there\u2019ll be some uncertainty there, so we\u2019ve got to get that message out.\u201d\n\nReeves announced in the Budget that she was abolishing the non-dom regime, which allows UK tax residents whose permanent home or \u201cdomicile\u201d is overseas to avoid paying British tax on their foreign income or capital gains for 15 years.\n\nIt will be replaced from April 6 2025 by a four-year residence-based scheme to offer \u201cinternationally competitive arrangements for people coming to the UK on a temporary basis\u201d.\n\nDowning Street said the change would not lead to a fall in the tax take from replacing the non-dom regime, and the Treasury still expects to raise \u00a333.8bn over the next five years from the reforms.\n\nNon-doms have been most concerned about changes to inheritance tax on existing trusts, with the issue often mentioned as the key factor driving them to leave the country.\n\nRachel de Souza, tax partner at RSM UK, said that while an increase to the temporary repatriation facility was \u201ca good move\u201d, it was \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d to prevent wealthy non-doms from leaving the UK.\n\n\u201cThe way to stem this exodus would be to maintain the exemption from IHT to offshore trusts, but also reverse the proposed changes to agricultural and business property relief which impacts the farmers and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nRobert Brodrick, a partner at law firm Payne Hicks Beach, said: \u201cIt\u2019s reassuring to see that they are at last responding to the concerns of the many people who are affected by this, but I don\u2019t think this is going to be enough to stem the tide\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It\u2019s helpful but the inheritance tax exposure is the biggest nail in the coffin.\u201d\n\nThe chancellor also said on Thursday she wanted to allay concerns from countries including India that the rules changes would not affect double-taxation agreements: \u201cThat\u2019s not the case: we are not going to be changing those double-taxation conventions.\u201d\n\nA Treasury figure said: \u201cWe\u2019re always interested in hearing ideas for making our tax regime more attractive to talented entrepreneurs and business leaders from around the world to help create jobs and wealth in the UK.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d0799d9b-a6fe-4c24-a0a1-f9c9df428269"}, {"uuid4": "5de4269a-cbc9-44e7-ac8b-047f39be4f81", "title": "Ministers weigh signing up UK to Europe customs scheme", "description": "EU trade chief says adding Britain to pan-European area is something Brussels \u2018could consider\u2019", "author": "Peter Foster", "published_date": "2025-01-23T10:55:14.492Z", "content": "UK ministers are looking at joining an EU trade arrangement with neighbouring countries as part of post-Brexit \u201creset\u201d talks which begin in earnest this year, as Brussels confirmed it would be open to the idea.\n\nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the EU\u2019s trade chief who is leading talks with Britain, said on Thursday a \u201cpan-European [customs] area is something we could consider\u201d as part of talks between London and Brussels.\n\n\u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d referred in a BBC interview to the idea of Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention, a customs agreement between the EU and 20 countries, including several in the Middle East and the Balkans, where all countries share the same \u201crules of origin\u201d.\n\nUK trade minister Douglas Alexander hinted at the possibility of Britain joining PEM when he told MPs this week: \u201cIt\u2019s something we are open to looking at. We want to take a pragmatic view on where the national interest lies.\u201d\n\nHowever, officials said that discussions of the idea within government are at an early stage. Alexander told the House of Commons\u2019 business and trade committee: \u201cThere are some stakeholders who would argue there would be disadvantages to some business sectors in the UK.\u201d\n\nThe rules of origin in trade deals require exporters to demonstrate their products are sufficiently locally made, usually about 45 per cent, to qualify for tariff-free access to the market.\n\nUnder the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the UK agreed a set of rules of origin with the EU. But joining PEM would allow UK companies to use inputs from those countries in their supply chains in order to be able to export goods into the EU tariff-free.\n\nJoining PEM would not, however, remove other elements of red tape, such as veterinary certificates, licences and some compliance documents.\n\nAsked about the idea on the BBC Today programme, housing minister Matthew Pennycook said: \u201cAs for this particular arrangement, we\u2019re not seeking to participate in it at the present time.\u201d\n\nThe idea of Britain joining PEM has been promoted by Labour MP Stella Creasy. \u201cRed tape from Brexit hits British business in many ways,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cJoining PEM would help cut the paperwork connected to rules of origin requirements which is why we have long argued it should be a priority for the UK as one way to undo the damage to trade leaving the EU has done.\u201d\n\nThe British Chambers of Commerce, the trade association, has said the government should consider rejoining the convention on the basis it \u201ccould provide additional flexibility\u201d to businesses trading with the EU.\n\n\u201cThe UK should propose rejoining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention to offer greater cumulation in rules of origin for manufacturers,\u201d the group said in its 2023 trade manifesto, based in part on survey data from members.\n\nIndustry insiders also said the government had been consulting some sectors over whether they would benefit from joining PEM, but added that no decisions had been made and quantitative analysis of the pros and cons was still needed in Whitehall.\n\nSince the signing of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the EU has indicated that it would be open to the UK joining PEM in the absence of a decision by London to rejoin a full-blown customs union.", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ae70737d-3e41-4ead-9679-d96b8f089612"}, {"uuid4": "e75717d6-33fa-4d4c-acd9-4b36f8ee66a1", "title": "Pressures at home and away add strain on UK finances ", "description": "Government is in a double bind as global uncertainty and need to improve public services force tough choices on spending ", "author": "Georgina Quach", "published_date": "2025-01-23T09:31:00.083Z", "content": "Good morning. The biggest story in Westminster this week? The British government has revealed that the Russian spy vessel Yantar had been tracked in the English Channel. (Our story is here.)\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s posts over on his social media network, Truth Social, have raised hopes that he will not, as feared, force Ukraine into a peace deal that leaves Kyiv worse off and Europe\u2019s security at risk.\n\nI\u2019m not going to pretend to be versed either in the ins and outs of naval espionage or Trump\u2019s thinking: but one way or the other all of this further tightens the government\u2019s room for manoeuvre when it comes to fiscal policy. Some more thoughts on that below.\n\nThe future is unwritten, but it is likely that over the next year the British government will have to navigate either a still more acrimonious relationship with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and an unreliable US president. In all likelihood, I think it will face both. It just seems probable that there will be direct consequences for the UK from some kind of disaster that comes out of the Trump presidency. As Janan Ganesh writes in his column this week:\n\nAll of which is going to put further pressure on government spending. I know I am becoming a stuck record on this, but it remains true: the UK has a rising number of old people, which puts upward pressure on health spending. And the UK faces a highly uncertain global backdrop which increases upward pressure on defence spending.\n\nNow, you can also spend money in a smarter way \u2014 over at Reform (the think-tank, not the political party), Rosie Beacon has a smart blog about what the government should be doing on hospital building. And if you modernise and improve the UK\u2019s defence procurement then your money will go further.\n\nBut neither the health nor defence department is going to be able to deliver what it needs to on reform alone. In a terrific column, Chris Giles sets out the big challenge for Rachel Reeves (that the UK hasn\u2019t run a budget surplus for nearly a quarter of a century). There is a reward to be had for the Labour administration if it can demonstrate it has a path to doing so at a time when few governments can. But both the party\u2019s MPs and Labour voters want and expect improvements to public services.\n\nReeves and Keir Starmer hope that \u201cgrowth\u201d can sand off some of those edges, which is part of why the chancellor is making such warm noises about a controversial third runway at the UK\u2019s largest airport. But I think it\u2019s the other way around: we\u2019ve stress tested whether you can meet British voters\u2019 expectations of the state and control public spending through spending cuts. The Labour government must make tough choices on raising income tax on \u201cordinary\u201d taxpayers, and difficult choices on reforming public services to do more with fewer public sector workers (staff being among the biggest of the government\u2019s costs).\n\nReforming planning and trying to shift the balance in how UK regulators balance risk and return are important steps. But such moves on their own are not going to give the government a way out of overseeing a series of difficult budgets if they want to achieve the fiscal consolidation, improved security and a better running NHS that are vital both to their own electoral prospects and to the UK\u2019s hopes of a better tomorrow.\n\nI am really enjoying Joe Hisaishi\u2019s second symphony, which you can listen to here.", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f40ee93f-d63f-4f8c-9c6d-d09f8b91f3f4"}, {"uuid4": "b3d488f9-9c2b-4d20-adad-e908ef3b87d2", "title": "Rachel Reeves\u2019 offensive against regulators sparks alarm from consumer groups", "description": "Chancellor\u2019s pro-business intervention raises concerns that protections are being weakened", "author": "Martin Arnold", "published_date": "2025-01-23T05:01:00.304Z", "content": "For a Labour chancellor it was a bold move: Rachel Reeves went to Davos and told an audience of global plutocrats that she wanted to make their lives easier by creating a riskier regulatory environment for UK consumers.\n\nFar away from the Swiss Alps, Reeves\u2019 offensive against regulators was cheered on by right-wing Conservatives, but some Labour MPs despaired that their chancellor\u2019s quest for growth was taking the party into dangerous territory.\n\n\u201cPeople are holding their heads in disbelief,\u201d said one senior Labour MP.\n\nReeves, speaking at the World Economic Forum, was adamant: \u201cYou have got to get the balance right. I think the balance has moved too far in regulating for risk. You have got to be able to protect consumers but people should be able to take risks as well.\u201d\n\nMarcus Bokkerink, chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, on Tuesday became the highest-profile casualty of Reeves\u2019 new approach, as ministers forced him out of his job over his allegedly lukewarm appetite for growth-focused reforms.\n\nHis sacking was intended to serve as a warning to other regulators, according to government officials. This month, Reeves demanded that 17 watchdogs produce action plans to boost growth and has warned them she will be watching.\n\nJohn McDonnell, former Labour shadow chancellor, said Reeves could hand a propaganda victory to Nigel Farage, leader of the populist Reform UK party, if she aggressively pursued her agenda at the expense of consumers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m becoming increasingly worried that this will all provide our opponents, in particular Reform, the opportunity to portray the Labour party as defending corporate abuse and profiteers,\u201d he said.\n\nReeves\u2019 efforts to protect business from what is seen in government circles as a damaging \u201ccompensation culture\u201d has taken many forms in recent months, with a common theme: less money for allegedly wronged consumers.\n\nThis week, Reeves sought to intervene in a Supreme Court case to shield banks and other car loan providers from multibillion-pound payouts in a landmark mis-selling case, arguing that it would \u201cadversely affect the UK\u2019s reputation as a place to do business\u201d.\n\nLast year, the Treasury successfully put pressure on regulators to slash a proposed compensation limit for victims of payment fraud from \u00a3415,000 to \u00a385,000, amid fears the new regime could seriously damage some fintech companies.\n\nReeves has also pushed for a review of the Financial Ombudsman Service to prevent more mass consumer compensation events, such as the \u00a350bn paid out by banks over the payment protection insurance scandal.\n\nThe Conservatives find themselves in a curious position, egging Reeves on to push further with an agenda that began in 2023 under Rishi Sunak, when regulators were given a \u201csecondary objective\u201d to promote economic growth and competitiveness.\n\nAndrew Griffith, shadow business secretary, wants to see a broader clearout of regulators and has been a critic of the Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog. He thought sacking Bokkerink was \u201ca curious place to start\u201d.\n\nBim Afolami, former Tory City minister, said: \u201cThe chancellor is doing exactly the right thing on the regulators. My advice to her is to keep going.\u201d Another former Tory Treasury minister said simply: \u201cI think she is probably right.\u201d\n\nBut Conservatives also believe Reeves, presiding over a stagnant economy, is using regulators as a scapegoat. Harriett Baldwin, a senior Tory, said the chancellor should \u201cacknowledge some of her own mistakes rather than blaming everyone else\u201d.\n\nGiven that Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s government is in the process of introducing a wave of employment regulation, many business leaders agree with the Tory critique that deregulation should start closer to Number 10. Ministers may yet water down that package.\n\nRegulators say that in return for focusing on growth, Reeves has given a clear signal she will stand by regulators when things go wrong \u2014 as they inevitably will. \u201cWe feel she has our backs now,\u201d said one.\n\nNikhil Rathi, FCA chief executive, told the House of Lords on Wednesday that proposed rule changes \u2014 such as easing controls on mortgage lending \u2014 could lead to more defaults. \u201cOne or two things are going to go wrong here,\u201d he said, arguing that parliament should give the watchdog a \u201cmetric of tolerable failure\u201d.\n\nConsumer groups have expressed alarm. \u201cThe combination of anti-regulation rhetoric \u2014 and now the firing of the CMA chair \u2014 signals to consumers that the government stands ready to peel back the protections that were built for them,\u201d said James Daley, head of the Fairer Finance research group.\n\nRocio Concha, a director at consumer group Which?, said the government was \u201cabsolutely right\u201d to focus on growth and the role of regulators. But she added: \u201cStrong consumer protections are not an impediment to growth. They are vital for economic growth because they help to create level playing fields for dynamic\u00a0competition, while ensuring consumers are protected\u00a0from being ripped off.\u201d\n\nProfessor John Thanassoulis of Warwick Business School, who is also an independent CMA panel member, said the government should \u201cresist the temptation to beat up on the CMA\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt will not drive marketwide productivity growth. It will instead reward some well-connected firms to the detriment of the countless, but silent, majority who want a market which is not expensive, which is fair, and whose firms put the consumer first.\u201d\n\nDame Meg Hillier, Labour chair of the Commons treasury committee, said that while she supported Reeves\u2019 aim of pushing regulators to promote growth, it was \u201ccritical that economic stability and protections for consumers are not unduly put at risk\u201d.\n\nFor now, most Labour MPs are not mobilising against Reeves. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of muttering about not going back to 2008,\u201d said one Labour grandee, referring to the \u201clight touch\u201d regulatory landscape before the financial crisis. \u201cBut it\u2019s not in the mainstream of the party yet \u2014 it\u2019s still seen as a bit niche.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/98539783-f974-4869-8aa0-73e119e46158"}, {"uuid4": "4fd8b010-e58d-4e8f-8d9b-24e10aabbc12", "title": "Elon Musk warned Reform UK donation might be difficult after joining Trump administration", "description": "Tech billionaire told an associate that any funding would be harder after this week\u2019s inauguration  ", "author": "Joe Miller", "published_date": "2025-01-23T05:01:00.177Z", "content": "Elon Musk has privately downplayed the chances of making a donation to Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK, telling an associate it would not be easy to give money to the British party after he joined the US government.\n\nThe associate said Musk told them earlier this month that Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration would complicate his ability to donate to Reform because of the tech billionaire\u2019s role running a waste-cutting unit in the new administration.\n\nThough Musk met Farage in December at Mar-a-Lago, the pair did not meet again when the Reform leader travelled to Washington, DC, for Trump\u2019s inauguration, said two people familiar with the matter.\n\nMusk has dramatically intervened in UK politics in recent months, proclaiming Reform as the country\u2019s \u201conly hope\u201d and frequently criticising Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nLast month, Farage said the X owner and Tesla boss was giving \u201cserious thought\u201d to a donation to Reform. The UK\u2019s lax rules on political donations allow foreign-owned entities \u2014 such as Musk\u2019s X subsidiary in the UK \u2014 to give unlimited amounts to British parties.\n\nBut the pair have since clashed over Musk\u2019s support for the far-right agitator and convicted criminal Tommy Robinson, who is in prison for contempt of court in relation to Robinson\u2019s libel of a Syrian refugee.\n\nEarlier this month, Musk called for Farage to be replaced as leader of Reform, posting on X that the veteran politician did not \u201chave what it takes\u201d, and suggesting alternatives, including Rupert Lowe, another Reform MP.\n\nFarage has cultivated ties with Trump, appearing at his rallies in the past. Though he was not invited to the Capitol Rotunda for Monday\u2019s ceremony, he did attend several parties around the event, including an official post-inauguration ball.\n\nMusk did not attend an inauguration party hosted by Brexit-backing businessmen Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore \u2014 allies of Farage \u2014 in Washington on Friday, sending a close associate instead.\n\nMusk has been tasked by Trump with leading the cost-cutting \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d, or DOGE, which will sit inside an existing federal agency.\n\nThere is no US law preventing Musk from contributing financially to Reform, and he still may decide to make a donation. However, a financial gift by a senior figure within the Trump administration to a British opposition party would potentially generate diplomatic tensions between the US and UK, which are close allies.\n\nSpeculation that Musk could make a donation of up to $100mn, following a media report in November, has given the UK rightwing party momentum as it rises in the polls and attracts some low-level defections from the Conservatives, the UK\u2019s largest rightwing party and official opposition.\n\nA spokesperson for Reform confirmed that Musk had not made a donation to date, and said: \u201cWe have a good relationship with Elon Musk and will continue to do so.\u201d Musk did not respond to a request for comment.", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/634e821e-6381-417d-9b98-f1a3903a48a2"}, {"uuid4": "a5db6351-1721-442a-a659-83465f984228", "title": "Surge in young people admitted to hospital in England over mental health ", "description": "Study finds jump of 65% between 2012-2022 and suggests thousands may not be getting needed specialist care", "author": "Amy Borrett", "published_date": "2025-01-22T23:30:59.140Z", "content": "The number of young people admitted to general hospital wards in England with a mental health concern jumped 65 per cent in the 10 years to 2022, according to research that suggests thousands of children may not be receiving the specialist care they need.\n\nThe surge in admissions of those aged five to 18 for mental health \u2014 from 24,198 to 39,925 \u2014 compared with a 10 per cent increase in \u201call cause\u201d admissions between 2012 and 2022, according to the study published on Wednesday.\n\nAround the world, most countries have been grappling with big rises in demand for mental healthcare, an issue thrown into sharp relief by the coronavirus pandemic. The substantial increase in patients in England comes as the NHS is struggling to meet record demand across its services.\n\nThe researchers at University College London said their findings \u201cprovide important messages for health policy internationally on delivering care for children and young people admitted in acute settings due to mental health concerns\u201d.\n\nIncreases in mental health admissions in England were biggest among girls between the ages of 11 and 15, rising from 9,091 to 19,349, or by about 113 per cent, said the study, the first to analyse national trends in acute medical wards.\n\nA surge of almost 515 per cent in admissions related to eating disorders was one of the biggest drivers behind the overall increase, according to the paper in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal.\n\nThe researchers also identified steep rises in the admission of children between the ages of five and 10, \u201cwith striking rates of self-harm in females\u201d in this group, although absolute numbers were still low.\n\nLee Hudson, senior author of the study and clinical associate professor at UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, said acute medical wards were important places for caring for young people with mental health concerns, especially those who also had physical health problems such as starvation from an eating disorder.\n\n\u201cHowever, the increased intensity we describe is presenting real challenges for acute wards, both for patients and their families and the staff supporting them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe researchers cited recent findings from the Health Services Safety Investigations Body, an arms-length body, that in 13 of 18 paediatric units surveyed, the ward environment was \u201cnot safe\u201d for caring for children and young people with \u201chigh-risk behaviours related to mental health concerns\u201d.\n\nThe researchers suggested that while Covid-19 had contributed to deteriorating mental health among young people, annual increases were registered across the entire 10-year period they had studied.\n\nFurther work was needed \u201cto examine how trends have evolved as the pandemic has subsided, although early data suggest there has not been a reduction to pre-pandemic levels\u201d, they added.\n\nIn an attempt to protect mental health expenditure, all of NHS England\u2019s integrated care boards, which manage budgets in different parts of the country, are at present required to ensure investment in mental health rises at a faster rate than their overall budget.\n\nBut Hudson called for \u201cbetter co-working between physical and mental health professionals across hospital and community teams, including, for example, adequate provision of psychiatrists and mental health trained nurses to support physical medical care on the actual ward\u201d.\n\nResearchers did not reach a firm conclusion as to whether difficulty in accessing support at an earlier stage in the community, before mental health problems escalated, was partly to blame for the soaring admissions.\n\nBut \u201ca population-level increase in mental health conditions\u201d had emerged clearly from the data, Hudson added.\n\nClaire Murdoch, NHS\u00a0England\u2019s national mental health director, said treatment and awareness of such conditions had vastly improved over the past decade, \u201cbut that also means the health service is treating record numbers as well as dealing with new issues like the negative impact and pressures that social media has on body image\u201d.\n\nThe NHS had rolled out hundreds of mental health teams in schools and set up 24/7 crisis support \u201cbut sometimes an admission to hospital is in the person\u2019s best interest\u201d to reduce the risk of harm, she said. Despite the rise in demand for services dealing with eating disorders, more than four-fifths of children started urgent treatment within a week, Murdoch added.\n\n", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b5f12d09-5818-43a4-a05c-0405430aa6bc"}, {"uuid4": "67f8b8fb-a0eb-4de9-9711-b1660bac4666", "title": "Brussels proposes extending EU banks\u2019 access to UK clearing houses", "description": "European Commission wants to prolong existing arrangements that benefit City of London", "author": "Andy Bounds", "published_date": "2025-01-22T20:20:46.085Z", "content": "Brussels has proposed extending EU banks\u2019 access to UK derivatives clearing houses for another three years in a victory for the City of London.\n\nThe European Commission on Wednesday announced it had introduced a new \u201cequivalence decision\u201d, which would allow banks and other financial institutions in the bloc to use some of the world\u2019s most critical market utilities in London until June 2028.\n\nEU politicians have sought to capture the lucrative euro-denominated clearing industry since the Brexit vote in 2016 but have accepted its financial system still depends on the UK, which dominates the global business of derivatives clearing.\n\nClearing houses reduce market risk by standing between two parties in a trade.\n\nLondon frequently handles deals nominally worth about $3.5tn a day. It is a global centre for trading interest rate derivatives and Brent crude oil, with clearing of deals handled at London Stock Exchange Group\u2019s LCH and at Intercontinental Exchange.\n\nEuropean derivatives traders had lobbied hard to extend the City\u2019s permit, which expires on June 30 after three years.

On 16 January, supermarket Morrisons was granted a High Court injunction to block further protests.\n\nPrior to the October Budget, farm campaign groups slammed supermarkets for squeezing their margins with low food prices and undercutting them by not backing homegrown produce.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Office for Budget Responsibility released a short costing of the IHT policy, estimating that it would raise an extra \u00a3500mn for the Treasury annually between 2027 and 2029, in line with the government\u2019s estimates.\n\nBut the fiscal watchdog noted that receipts would probably taper off after seven years as farmers increasingly gifted their properties to children and modified their tax planning strategies.\n\nThe OBR also suggested that it would be \u201cmore difficult for some older individuals to quickly restructure their affairs\u201d in terms of inheritance planning to adjust to the new measures.\n\nVictoria Atkins, Conservative shadow environment secretary, said the government had \u201cchosen to destroy British family farming for little return. The OBR is clear that it will be near impossible for older farmers to restructure their affairs quickly in response to this vindictive tax.\u201d\n\nFarmers say the sector was struggling with the pressures of climate change, real-term cuts to subsidies, high inflation, wafer-thin margins and the prospect of increased competition as the UK strikes post-Brexit trade deals before chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the IHT changes.\n\nThe exemption was introduced in the 1980s to allow farms to remain in the same family after the death of an owner, a trend that many have warned will become much harder. However, it has helped push up the price of fields as wealthy individuals have bought agricultural land as a form of legal tax avoidance.\n\nFarmers looking to pass on their estate, and their spouses, are each eligible for \u00a31mn of relief before they start paying IHT on their land, on top of the usual inheritance allowances.\n\nGiven that couples already enjoy a threshold of \u00a31mn on their estates that means that two spouses would enjoy a threshold nearer to \u00a33mn, officials have noted.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cOur reform to agricultural and business property reliefs will mean estates will pay a reduced effective inheritance tax rate of 20%, rather than standard 40%, and payments can be spread over 10 years, interest free.\n\n\u201cThis is a fair and balanced approach, which fixes the public services we all rely on, affecting around 500 estates next year.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/db76df80-de96-4799-ab67-43983733badb"}, {"uuid4": "8929b49c-e77d-4616-a0da-757340313515", "title": "If the UK wants to lead in AI, it must fund more PhDs", "description": "Universities are the cornerstone of the country\u2019s reputation as a global research hub but the business model is in crisis", "author": "Jeremy Silver", "published_date": "2025-01-22T18:12:13.896Z", "content": "The writer is an honorary professor at UCL and former CEO of Digital Catapult\n\nThere has been much excitement at the UK government\u2019s plan to invest in artificial intelligence. The country\u2019s reputation as a global research and talent developer is proof of the immense contributions made by our leading universities. However, recent economic and social changes have put the business model of universities in crisis. This threatens their ability to maintain the country\u2019s reputation for developing AI pioneers such as Alex Kendall of Wayve and Sir Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind.\n\nFunding PhDs is a cornerstone of our track record. Unfortunately, PhD students with UK Research and Innovation funding in the UK fell under the previous government from 6,835 in 2018-19 to 4,900 in 2022-23, according to Times Higher Education.\n\nThe flow of gifted researchers from around the world is a key revenue driver for our leading research universities. For one thing, UK universities are heavily reliant on these students to deliver teaching. The average stipend for a UK PhD student is around \u00a320,000. These low-paid PhD candidates therefore bring enormous value to the UK. Quite simply, without a healthy PhD student population in this country, our capacity to deliver university teaching and carry out research will collapse.\n\nBetter still, talented PhD students and their start-ups are the hunting ground of global technology companies, attracting investment into the UK. The research that these individuals deliver under the tutelage of established academics is producing the foundational algorithms that play a key role in the global AI revolution.\n\nIf that hunting ground dries up because the flow of PhD students declines, big global tech players will look elsewhere. International academics will give up and move abroad. The economic value of our universities will decline in turn.\n\nThis is a challenge that UK universities have been facing since Brexit, which reduced the number of international students from the EU, and the previous government\u2019s* lack of industrial strategy.\n\nThe truth is that the business model of universities is poorly understood by many in government, even those who fund the sector. The majority of the population tends to only think about universities as places that teach undergraduates. But the engine of their innovation, growth and value lies in the work that is delivered by postgraduates, both PhDs and postdoctoral researchers.\n\nThese two areas are rarely examined together. Their funding is divided. The Office for Students is an independent non-departmental public body that reports to the Department for Education. It manages the viability of undergraduate teaching programmes and certifies degree-awarding powers in England. It also distributes an average annual budget of about \u00a31bn in grants. But research, development and innovation are funded by UKRI, a separate body overseen by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. Because they are split apart, it has been rare for anyone in government to look at the whole model.\n\nToo often the disbursement of PhD funding is driven by the politics of levelling up \u2014 redistributing funds to underperforming and neglected regions. This leaves the powerhouses of research and innovation that have brought significant economic benefit to the UK struggling to remain viable. Indeed, the whole innovation landscape is littered with different kinds of institutions attempting to collaborate despite various layers of regulation and governance policies that in effect keep them apart.\n\nGovernment tech adviser Matt Clifford\u2019s excellent AI action plan references many of the technology\u2019s opportunities for the country. But if we really want to build an AI growth programme for the UK over the long term, then we need to realise that the UK university business model is in urgent need of reform.\n\nWe can learn much from the way in which US universities such as MIT and Stanford fund their PhD programmes by encouraging greater numbers of external funders to offer scholarships and support. We also need to streamline the academic pipeline from research to development to innovation so that all those involved \u2014 from universities to technology centres known as \u201ccatapults\u201d to start-ups to major industry \u2014 work together and not in competition.\n\nIf the UK is to capitalise on its existing institutions, we need a root-and-branch examination of PhD funding, including whether the current agencies are optimal for disbursing precious government resources. AI provides a catalyst for change.

That means it trumps other things.\u201d\n\nShe is expected to signal in a speech next week that the government favours the expansion of Gatwick and Luton airports, whilst reaffirming her support for a third runway at Heathrow.\n\nHeathrow\u2019s expansion was previously opposed by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and several senior Labour figures.\n\nSome Whitehall officials believe Reeves is attempting to bounce Starmer into publicly endorsing a third runway. \u201cThat\u2019s not my assessment,\u201d said one ally of the prime minister.\n\nStarmer, asked about the issue in the House of Commons on Wednesday, refused to comment on \u201cspeculation\u201d, adding: \u201cWe as a government are committed to growth.

An unusual intervention by chancellor Rachel Reeves has reduced the risk that the sector becomes a total write-off.\n\nIt is not hard to see why Reeves has asked for permission to get involved in the case. The Supreme Court in April will decide whether lenders should be on the hook for tens of billions of pounds in compensation for historic loan agreements, which they thought to be legal at the time.\n\nThat would spook investors, not least because it is only five years since the saga of mis-sold payment protection insurance ended up costing more than 10 times initial estimates. One \u00a350bn bill could be seen as an aberration, but two in quick succession may start to look like a worrying trend. Even in heavily regulated sectors such as financial services, investors should be able to expect some level of consistency and predictability around the rules.\n\nBanks, too, can argue that they need predictability in order to lend money. Most restarted lending a few days after the October ruling plunged the industry into confusion. But it is difficult to make long-term investment decisions if you live in fear that policies currently considered standard will be retrospectively punished 10 years down the road.\n\nReeves is hardly alone in worrying that squeezing banks too hard could hurt the economy. American lenders squealed after regulators proposed a package of tough new rules known as Basel III, arguing that they would be forced to tighten the lending spigots.\n\nUK banks are still pricing in a hefty slug of risk. Shares in Lloyds Banking Group, which has the UK\u2019s largest car loan book, trade roughly in line with where they were last October \u2014 underperforming less-exposed NatWest and Barclays, which climbed 15 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively, over the same period.\u00a0Close Brothers, which has higher exposure relative to its overall balance sheet, has even more ground to make up.\n\nIt is still too soon to put the foot on the gas \u2014 the court will have the final say, and there is a good chance lenders will end up paying at least some level of compensation.\n\nStill, the fact that the Treasury has even tried to intervene could be seen as a positive for the industry more broadly.

As the cost of its borrowing has risen since the autumn, the chances of meeting its main self-imposed fiscal rule \u2014 to borrow only for investment by the end of the decade \u2014 have dwindled. The setback has been met with fierce rhetoric from the government. Whether from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves, his chancellor, or their spokespeople, the adjectives to describe the fiscal rules have tended to shuffle between \u201cironclad\u201d and \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d. Their attitude is always \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d.\n\nSentiment has improved in UK government bond markets over the past week, but many are yet to be convinced. Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of hedge fund firm Bridgewater Associates, is less than impressed, saying that gilts could be heading for a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d. Of course, this was overblown, but his comments reflect a broader concern in financial markets that a gap exists between tough fiscal rhetoric and the reality of UK budgetary policy \u2014 and it far precedes the current Labour government.\n\nWhat is needed to provide the budgetary stability on which the rest of the UK economy can build is therefore simple. No more rhetoric. No more announcements of tighter fiscal policy either now or some time in the future. Instead, Reeves needs to implement the tax increases and spending plans outlined in October without any compromise on when they are due to come into force in April.\n\nThese are sizeable. Along with the large and messy increase in employers\u2019 national insurance, there are continued income tax rises in the form of frozen allowances and far from lavish public expenditure increases. Together, the measures are set to reduce government borrowing significantly. The overall deficit is forecast to fall from 4.5 per cent of GDP in 2024-25 to 3.6 per cent in 2025-26, while the current budget deficit, excluding capital investment, is set to halve from 2 per cent of GDP to 0.9 per cent over the same period.\n\nThis will be an exercise in show, not tell. Reducing borrowing by this much is reasonably rare for UK governments \u2014 it will become clear by the summer whether Reeves and her policies are on track. Success would immediately demonstrate a difference between UK fiscal policy and that of similar countries.\n\nIn recent years, US administrations have shown no ability to run a deficit much under 6 per cent of GDP, and there\u2019s no improvement in sight. The European Commission expects the French budget deficit to have exceeded 6 per cent of GDP last year, with little prospect of a political agreement to deliver much improvement. Underlying German public finances are strong, but its economy is weak. And debt levels in the UK, though high, are still far lower than those in Italy.\n\nBond markets often have a mind of their own, but it would be difficult to single out the UK for special punishment if it is the one decent-sized advanced country with the ability to pass legislation to impose fiscal consolidation and actually see it through. This is what Reeves must do. If growth suffers, the Bank of England would be in a strong position to ease monetary policy and offset the fiscal tightening.\n\nThere are no guarantees in the business of persuading financial markets that they have more to lose if they bet against you. The UK government must also hope that consumers begin to spend their recent real income gains and improve growth. It needs to demonstrate that any expansion will come with some recovery in productivity growth. And that the increases in employers\u2019 national insurance must not have a much more damaging impact on jobs and prices than already expected.\n\nNone will be achieved with more speeches about non-negotiable commitments to ironclad fiscal rules.\n\nchris.giles@ft.com", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0266c1f4-5757-4077-875a-1b7536c15d4a"}, {"uuid4": "5b6041e9-a522-45ea-9710-7d809f20afea", "title": "Ousting of CMA chair prompts warnings of interference in UK regulation", "description": "Move was part of Labour government\u2019s drive to remove obstacles to economic growth", "author": "Jim Pickard", "published_date": "2025-01-22T14:05:06.256Z", "content": "Antitrust lawyers have questioned the \u201cextraordinary\u201d decision by ministers to force out the chair of Britain\u2019s competition watchdog, suggesting that it could have a \u201cchilling\u201d effect on other UK regulators.\n\nThe government confirmed the departure of Marcus Bokkerink as chair of the Competition and Markets Authority on Tuesday evening, after the Financial Times reported that business secretary Jonathan Reynolds had intervened.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves, speaking to Bloomberg in Davos on Tuesday, implicitly criticised Bokkerink: \u201cHe recognised it was time for him to move on and make way for somebody who does share the mission and the strategic direction this government are taking.\u201d\n\nThis month, ministers ordered 17 of Britain\u2019s biggest regulators to set out how they intend to help boost UK economic growth. Stephen Phipson, head of manufacturing lobbying group Make UK, on Wednesday applauded the government\u2019s efforts to make regulation \u201cfit for purpose\u201d.\n\nBut a number of lawyers and lobbyists said Bokkerink\u2019s resignation had come out of the blue.\n\n\u201cTo be honest it was a bit of a surprise,\u201d said one business lobbyist. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in lots of discussions with the CMA\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. and they seemed to be really getting it and making changes.\u201d\n\nOne antitrust lawyer at a London firm said the move would have a \u201cchilling and intimidating effect\u201d on independent regulators across the country.\n\n\u201cAlthough in the short term it seems reassuring for business, if competition policy is at the mercy of political fashion it becomes less stable and predictable, which undermines business confidence,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cIt is an extraordinary move by the government to interfere so much in a competition authority,\u201d they added.\n\nBokkerink\u2019s departure raises questions over whether ministers are prioritising the demands of big business over competing priorities such as consumer rights and the environment.\n\nThe government has appointed as new interim CMA chair Doug Gurr, who ran Amazon\u2019s UK business during the company\u2019s tussle with the CMA over its minority investment in Deliveroo, which the regulator ultimately approved in 2020.\n\nOne person said the forced exit looked like a \u201cdesperate move from a struggling government\u201d that was trying to win back popularity with business leaders after imposing extra regulations and taxes on corporations in last year\u2019s Budget.\n\nThe move has also led to speculation about the fate of the CMA\u2019s chief executive Sarah Cardell and whether she may also be replaced.\n\nAndrew Griffith, shadow business secretary, told the House of Commons on Wednesday that the Conservative party wanted regulatory reform so businesses \u201ccarry less deadweight\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut dismissing the non-executive part-time chairman of the CMA seems a curious place to start,\u201d he told the House of Commons. \u201cHe\u2019s not responsible for day-to-day decision making at the CMA. That\u2019s the job of the chief executive. Did they aim and miss?\u201d\n\nCardell has been at pains in recent weeks to emphasise that the regulator is taking the government\u2019s growth mandate seriously. In November, Cardell told the FT the agency was planning a review of its merger remedies, signalling more mergers could be approved based on undertakings such as price freezes rather than forcing the divestiture of assets.\n\nOne person familiar with the matter said Cardell had \u201cpositive discussions\u201d about her role with ministers since Bokkerink\u2019s resignation\u201d.\n\nMax von Thun, Europe director at the Open Markets Institute, said the CMA had been at the forefront of global efforts to push back against rising market concentration, particularly in the \u201cmonopolistic\u201d tech sector.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s decision to replace the authority\u2019s chair with a former Amazon executive, at a time when a handful of US tech giants are tightening their grip over the future of artificial intelligence, is a major strategic blunder,\u201d he said.\n\nLawyers and competition specialists noted that Clare Barclay, until recently Microsoft UK head and now in another senior role at the company, is chairing the government\u2019s new Industrial Strategy Advisory Council.\n\nIn a two-page statement released on Tuesday night, Bokkerink said he had helped to refocus the CMA to ensure it delivered on empowering \u201cconsumers and effective competition \u2014 instead of being held back by a few powerful incumbents setting the rules for everyone else\u201d.\n\nBusiness groups welcomed the government\u2019s intervention. Craig Beaumont, executive director at the Federation of Small Businesses, said he hoped the CMA \u201cwill now do more on growth\u201d. One banker said the CMA had been seen as an obstacle and the ousting of Bokkerink could be a way to send a message to the regulator\u2019s staff.\n\nHis exit comes as the CMA has been handed new powers to regulate digital markets.\n\nIt announced last week that Google would be the first company the watchdog would investigate to decide if the tech giant warranted a special market status in light of its position in search services, which could see it bound by tougher conduct rules.\n\nThe government is due to issue a \u201cstrategic steer\u201d to the CMA in the coming weeks, setting out its priorities for the regulator. However, beyond its desire for the watchdog to focus on growth, it was unclear what Labour actually wanted the CMA to do, lawyers said.\n\n\u201cThe government is obviously unhappy with the CMA but doesn\u2019t seem to have concrete views on what\u2019s wrong,\u201d said one senior antitrust lawyer.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ivan Levingston", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/976ca0e3-b47b-44c4-9583-a3fcdd713283"}, {"uuid4": "b0d5eaf2-09b0-4e3a-9f2c-e1c18cbb8723", "title": "Russian spy ship found \u2018gathering intelligence\u2019 in UK waters", "description": "Defence minister tells Moscow Britain will not shy away from \u2018robust action\u2019 amid fears of potential sabotage of undersea cables", "author": "John Paul Rathbone", "published_date": "2025-01-22T13:59:06.840Z", "content": "Britain\u2019s defence minister warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that \u201cwe will not shy away from robust action\u201d after telling parliament that a Russian spy vessel had been operating in UK waters for the second time since November.\n\nJohn Healey said the Russian spy ship, Yantar, had been tracked in the English Channel by a warship after loitering over critical undersea infrastructure.

Murdoch\u2019s company had been \u201cfinally held to account for its illegal actions and its blatant disregard for the law\u201d, he added.\n\nThe settlement will bring considerable relief to some of the Murdoch executives who were expected to be named in the case.\n\nThey include Rebekah Brooks, former editor of The Sun and now chief executive of News UK, and Will Lewis, who previously worked for Murdoch\u2019s UK newspaper business and is now publisher of The Washington Post.\n\nLewis\u2019s position in Murdoch\u2019s news group at the time has been closely scrutinised since he took the helm of the US newspaper more than a year ago.\n\nNGN has always said illegal voicemail interception took place only at the News of the World, which was shut down after it was disclosed that journalists at the paper had hacked the voicemail of murdered British teenager Milly Dowler.\n\nIt had, until Wednesday, made no admission of unlawful activities at The Sun, although it has previously reached financial settlements with individuals about the paper\u2019s activities without any admission of liability.\n\nForcing an admission of fault from NGN has been a primary motivation for the Duke of Sussex, who was facing considerable financial risk in pursuing the case.\n\nThe case was set to be the climax of the prince\u2019s campaign against Britain\u2019s tabloid press, which he blames for the death of his mother, who was chased by paparazzi photographers before her death in a car crash in Paris in 1997.\n\nThe prince previously secured damages of \u00a3140,600 from Mirror Group Newspapers and has outstanding claims against Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail.\n\nEmma Jones, board director at campaign group Hacked Off, said the settlement marked a \u201chumiliating day for The Sun and the senior executives at NGN, who have finally admitted that allegations of illegality made against the publisher are true\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that the public and parliament were lied to by the newspaper and its publisher, as part of the most extraordinary corporate cover-up in living memory,\u201d she added.\n\nThe settlement will mean the need for a further payout by Murdoch\u2019s US broadcaster Fox, which covers all the costs under the terms of the separation of News Corp and 21st Century Fox.\n\nFox, in a similar eleventh-hour deal in 2023, agreed to pay $787.5mn to settle a defamation case in which it was accused by voting machine maker Dominion of broadcasting false accusations of election fraud in the 2020 US presidential election.", "tag": "world-uk?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/417da3c7-6b28-4b6f-a4d1-b8fb0dd1bd33"}, {"uuid4": "7d456a4f-260d-4e14-bd02-eff2a2330cb8", "title": "Am I liable for tax if I sell unwanted goods online?", "description": "I\u2019m decluttering and using an online selling service to make money", "author": "Lucy Warwick-Ching", "published_date": "2025-01-22T12:01:58.054Z", "content": "My new year resolution for 2025 was to declutter our home before moving house later this year, so I began using an online selling service. However, HM Revenue & Customs\u2019 guidance suggests people who trade second-hand items through online selling services may need to pay tax and register for self-assessment. How much tax will I need to pay if I continue to sell unwanted items online, and is it worth it?\n\nZena Hanks, private wealth partner at Saffery, says online platforms will soon start sharing sales information and the personal data of its users with HMRC. If an individual has sold a certain number of items, generated sales of \u00a31,700 or more, or provided a paid-for service on a website or an app in 2024, they will be contacted by the platform in advance of their personal details and sales information being shared with HMRC. The principles of whether the sale of items or the provision of paid-for services is taxable remains unchanged.\n\nThe sharing of information is a move towards more transparency for the online platforms and underpins HMRC\u2019s efforts to tackle what it perceives to be a tax gap. With that in mind we need to be clear what does and what does not need to be reported to HMRC.\n\nGetting some money back for items no longer needed as part of a declutter is unlikely to qualify as an activity that generates a tax liability for two reasons. Under first principles there is likely to be a cost associated with the original acquisition of the item which would be taken into account when working out if any tax is due. In addition there needs to be an intention to make a profit. In the situation described here there is no suggestion that the sale is being motivated by a profit and it is likely the items sold would not generate sufficient proceeds to generate an overall profit.\n\nYou do however need to report sale activities when you are selling assets at a profit \u2014 for example you upcycle furniture, or you source clothes or furniture to sell on at a profit, or if you sell any personal possessions for more than \u00a36,000. There is a reporting requirement if you provide paid-for services for example garden maintenance, dog walking, taxi driving, delivering food. In addition, income and free products received from social influencing may also generate a taxable activity \u2014 all of this depends on the numbers involved. If there is sufficient activity and income, that may generate an obligation to report the income details to HMRC and any associated tax will need to be paid.\n\nThe rules on how to tax trading activities haven\u2019t changed and that includes the availability of the \u00a31,000 trading allowance. What has changed is that online platforms are being compelled to provide sales information and the associated sellers\u2019 personal information to HMRC. It is that information that HMRC will use to ensure that those generating income are paying the correct amount of tax. If you are in any doubt you should speak to a professional adviser as soon as possible. If income does need to be reported it is always better that an \u201cunprompted\u201d disclosure is provided to HMRC.\n\nThe management at the local golf club where my student son works part-time have told him that they are struggling to remain profitable, so they will not be replacing anyone who leaves. To ensure that my son keeps his job, could he offer to work as a self-employed contractor who invoices the golf club for hours worked?\n\nRachel Roberts, a partner in the employment and immigration team HCR Law, says the option of offering to work as a self-employed contractor may seem like a good solution but there are key considerations that your son may want to think about. First, and most important, it would not be possible for your son simply to switch from being a part-time employee to self-employed if, in practice, the nature of his role and his duties remain the same.\n\nWhile your son and the club could agree to change the label of his employment, there is a real risk that HMRC would challenge this. HMRC would apply a variety of tests to determine if your son is providing his services as an employee under the \u201cdisguise\u201d of self-employment.\n\nThe key difference between whether your son will be treated as a self-employed contractor or an employee is the degree of control the club has over him. For example, if your son is unable to choose his working hours, work for other businesses or appoint someone else to provide the services on his behalf, then there is a high probability that he will be treated by HMRC as an employee. This could have tax implications as HMRC could serve a demand for backdated PAYE and national insurance payments.\n\nEven if your son\u2019s work does meet the criteria needed to be deemed as self-employment, he will need to bear in mind that self-employed contractors accept a higher level of financial risk. Your son would be responsible for filing his own tax returns. There is also a risk of personal liability if your son provides his services directly to the club rather than through an intermediary, such as a limited company.\n\nAnother key consideration is that your son would be offering to give up his employment rights. Self-employed contractors are not afforded the same employment rights as employees. For example, your son would not be eligible for sick pay or holiday pay. The golf club could also terminate any contractual agreement with your son on relatively short notice if his services are not needed.\n\nAt this stage, it might be premature for your son to initiate discussions about working on a self-employed basis, particularly if his sole aim is to keep his job. The good news is that the club is considering alternative options to dismissal, such as freezing recruitment (as you have mentioned).\n\nIf the situation worsens, the club could consider other cost-cutting measures, such as reducing the number of working hours or shifts and possibly even reducing the rate of pay. Depending on how long your son has worked for the club, he could be entitled to a statutory redundancy payment if his role is terminated.\n\nThe opinions in this column are intended for general information purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice.

The first lady is only the second to serve non-consecutive terms of office: the Trumps follow Grover and Frances Cleveland, who served from 1885-89 and then again from 1893-97. But during her first time in office Melania barely registered in public, preferring to keep out of the spotlight while she raised Barron, the couple\u2019s son who was 10 at the time of the inauguration. She made almost no speeches, and started few initiatives: her Be Best platform, to raise the issues of child welfare, promote \u201ckindness\u201d and crack down on online bullying, fairly failed to launch.\n\nStill now, eight years on, she remains an enigmatic presence. The scant clues that have offered access to her inner thinking have been based on wardrobe semaphores and gestures as we attempt to understand the woman behind the sphinx-like gaze. In particular, the Trump marriage has been a constant source of speculation: is it real, an arrangement or a sham? When Melania finally conceded to move into the White House in June 2017, the couple reportedly became the first since Richard and Pat Nixon to take up separate rooms.\n\nOften, one gets the impression that Melania can\u2019t stand her husband, or can hardly tolerate his company. She wears an expression of barely concealed impatience when watching her spouse doing his peculiar \u201cYMCA\u201d boogies and recoils from the simplest physical advance.\n\nHer cool aversion was noted once again, in front of billions, during this week\u2019s inauguration when his attempts to plant a kiss on Melania\u2019s cheek were thwarted by a piece of millinery sporting an outsize and spouse-repelling brim. Potus was left puckered, flailing and humiliated; Melania sat stock-still. Any emotion in her face was also screened as most of it remained in the hat\u2019s shade.\n\nFor Trump, who likes to burnish his strongman image with a veneer of inviolable masculinity and power, Melania makes an extraordinary foil. While the Potus surrounds himself with yes men and supplicants, his own wife makes no secret of the fact that she often disagrees with Donald, and that her \u201cfirst priority\u2009is to be a mom\u201d.\n\nRare is the person in Trump\u2019s orbit who describes him as being less than a first concern. But could the testy nature of the Trump union help temper his more alarming Maga views? Maybe for all her husband\u2019s hubris, Melania holds more power than we realise. Just as Trump has \u201cemployed\u201d Barron as an unofficial adviser on youth-think, he seeks his wife\u2019s counsel, too. In his post-inauguration speech, made to supporters on Monday, Trump credited Melania with convincing him to tone down the list of grievances he had planned to air. In particular, she had \u201cbegged\u201d him not to raise the subject of the \u201cJ6\u201d insurrectionists who led the Capitol Hill riots, which he managed to stay mute on, at least until he left the stage.\n\nDuring her conversation with Fox & Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt last week, Melania spoke about their marriage, and how she sometimes holds a contrary point of view. The most significant point of difference, as revealed in her memoir, is that she supports abortion and a woman\u2019s right to choose. \u201cI\u2019m standing on my own two feet, independent. I have my own thoughts,\u201d said Flotus in the rare interview. \u201cI don\u2019t always agree [with] what my husband is saying or doing\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I give him my advice and sometimes he listens.\u201d For his part, Trump seems almost conciliatory and gentle when talking of his wife: when asked of her views on abortion, he told Fox News, that he had told her to \u201cstick with your heart\u201d and \u201cwrite what you believe\u201d.\n\nCompared to the gusty exposition of her husband, Melania\u2019s crisp exclamations seem almost erudite. And they indicate that behind the carapace of blankness there stirs a woman preparing to enter a new phase. Melania 2.0 has arrived in Washington in a different guise \u2014 and I don\u2019t just mean The Hamburglar suit. She is making a documentary about the transition, she is releasing crypto, having shepherded her son and first priority through adolescence to university she has given him the wings with which \u201cto fly\u201d. (Good luck with that lift-off, incidentally; Barron is staggeringly tall.)\n\nBut, like her husband, she is nursing grudges against those who treated her poorly last time around. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t accept me,\u201d she said of her first time in office, \u201cthey didn\u2019t understand me the way maybe they do now.\u201d This time, she continued. \u201cI know where I will be going, I know the rooms.\u201d\n\nSuch statements show signs of more ambition. She may only have been talking about how she prefers the decorative scheme. But if there is a microgram of hope for this new world order, one wonders if Melania will use her new resolve to try to use her influence for good. Imagine if she could actually get her Be Best platform off the ground. Last time she tried to engage the leaders of the \u201cstreaming platforms\u201d with her concerns over online safety she \u201cdidn\u2019t have much support\u201d. Perhaps now those same folk are quaffing Maga Kool-Aid and Nazi-saluting their supporters (we see you, Elon), she might have a better chance.\n\nOr perhaps she will simply elide any further public-facing duty and make house a second time in her new first home. That\u2019s the riddle of Melania, it\u2019s impossible to know.\n\njo.ellison@ft.com\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/dac5e30c-1043-4f88-9c66-8a59ecbd9b74"}, {"uuid4": "b95b8341-85dc-4490-bac0-d7a30d2a5d47", "title": "Supercomputers: the new superpower status symbol", "description": "US president\u2019s endorsement shows data-centre dominion is now a national priority", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-01-25T05:00:52.288Z", "content": "Almost a hundred years ago, New York\u2019s skyline became the scene of a bitter battle. The prize: displacing the Woolworth Building as the world\u2019s tallest property. Such superlatives mattered to a growing, industrialised nation keen to flex its dominance. The winner was 40 Wall Street, swiftly pipped by the Chrysler Building, which in turn lost the title to the Empire State Building.\n\nToday, there is a new superpower status symbol: data centres. The latest bid for digital supremacy is Stargate. This mammoth project led by artificial intelligence company OpenAI, and announced by US President Donald Trump, pledges to spend up to $500bn over four years to construct world-changing AI infrastructure \u2014 basically warehouses filled with clusters of microchips \u2014 on an unprecedented scale.\n\nTrump\u2019s endorsement, with a reassurance that no government money is involved, shows data-centre dominion is now a national priority. That is no surprise. New regimes love big gestures. Think of the \u201c10 great buildings\u201d with which Chairman Mao peppered Beijing in 1959, or The Line, a 106-mile sliver of a city under construction at the behest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin-Salman.\n\nStargate is a trophy too. But it is also an arms race, because OpenAI is in effect building a weapon. Co-founder Sam Altman\u2019s goal is to achieve \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d, the kind that outflanks human beings. That this is now a White House-backed initiative reflects a superpower reality: whichever country reaches AGI first poses a significant threat, commercially and militarily, to the rest.\n\nWhat does $500bn buy? First, assume the money can actually be raised; departed OpenAI co-founder and Tesla head Elon Musk is sceptical. The latest Blackwell chips from Nvidia could cost about $50,000 apiece, suggesting Altman\u2019s budget could cover 10mn of them. The biggest AI supercomputer in the world today, Musk\u2019s Colossus, has about 100,000. Size alone does not guarantee AGI success, but it is an important factor.\n\nAt its most mundane, OpenAI is following other big technology firms. So-called hyperscalers Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet are collectively on course to invest $260bn in capital expenditure next year, according to Visible Alpha. Stargate\u2019s plan of an average $125bn a year is big, but not substantially greater than theirs.\n\nBut Altman\u2019s scheme is undeniably different. Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are building computing power customers can use, with a path to sizeable near-term revenue. OpenAI\u2019s foray is more of a moonshot. Succeed, and vast profit awaits. Fail, and a surfeit of servers could push down prices and profit for the whole industry.\n\nIn the real world, meanwhile, traditional projections of power remain in fashion. China is planning 118 skyscrapers higher than London\u2019s Shard, to add to the 100 or so it already has, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. Saudi Arabia, keen to be an AI hub, is also eyeing what will be the world\u2019s tallest building, the Jeddah Tower. It\u2019s just that in the AI age, there are more ways to reach for the heavens.\n\njohn.foley@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/651339b1-bb08-4710-8fe5-7a68452ee3b1"}, {"uuid4": "52b64ec9-1d4b-462f-93b8-5507bf84217f", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s exit from Paris climate accord has \u2018huge impact\u2019, says Brazil\u2019s COP30 chief", "description": "US withdrawal will make it \u2018much harder\u2019 to curb global warming, says Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago", "author": "Michael Pooler", "published_date": "2025-01-25T05:00:52.243Z", "content": "The US withdrawal from the Paris climate accord for a second time under President Donald Trump will have a \u201chuge impact\u201d on efforts to curb global warming, the incoming head of the UN COP30 climate summit has warned.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, the experienced Brazilian diplomat and climate negotiator appointed this week, told the Financial Times that the exit of the US could also allow nations such as China, India and Brazil to take a bigger role in the world\u2019s most important climate talks.\n\nTrump fulfilled a pledge on his first day in office to once again pull the US out of what he described as an \u201cunfair, one-sided Paris climate accord rip-off\u201d. The US was the first country to withdraw during his first term as president in 2017, a move reversed by President Joe Biden in 2021.\n\nMany scientists already say the world is way off track to meet the Paris accord goals of limiting the global average temperature rise to well below 2C and preferably no more than 1.5C from pre-industrial times. The UN has predicted that the temperature rise will reach 2.9C this century.\n\nCorr\u00eaa do Lago said the US pivot \u201cis going to make it much more difficult\u201d to limit global warming and would \u201chave an immense impact on efforts to keep temperature rises below 1.5C\u201d.

China is constantly bringing forward its objectives, for example, this year it will sell more electric cars than internal combustion ones.\u201d\n\nThe FT reported this week that Argentina\u2019s libertarian President Javier Milei, among the few world leaders invited to Trump\u2019s inauguration, was also weighing an exit from the Paris Agreement.\n\nCorr\u00eaa do Lago said Argentina, while free to make its own decisions, could jeopardise its participation in the newly agreed trade deal between the EU and the Mercosur bloc of South American nations.\n\n\u201cYou have to remember that to be able to benefit from the EU-Mercosur agreement, you have to be a member of the Paris Agreement\u201d.\n\nThe 65-year-old veteran diplomat, who has served as ambassador to Japan and India as well as Brazil\u2019s lead climate negotiator, also faces the task of finding ways to plug a trillion-dollar gap in climate change funding ahead of the COP30 to be held in the Amazon port of Bel\u00e9m in November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that we think far outside traditional thinking on climate finance,\u201d he said, citing reports by former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers and Indian economist NK Singh on the role of multilateral banks and by a G20 group of experts on \u201cgreen growth\u201d. \u201cWe have to make mainstream investment favour climate [finance].\u201d\n\nBrazil has one of the world\u2019s greenest electricity grids, thanks to abundant hydropower, and has reduced Amazon deforestation sharply under the government of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\n\nBut agriculture remains a large source of its emissions, as the country is one of the world\u2019s biggest beef and soy producers.\n\nEnvironmentalists have also criticised Brazil for boosting oil production, with the aim of becoming a top global exporter by the end of the decade.\n\nCorr\u00eaa do Lago said Lula had been clear about the need for a \u201cfair transition\u201d away from fossil fuels that would not increase poverty or hurt living standards in a nation where many still live below the breadline.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we can do in the preparation for COP30 is to restore confidence that climate change can be fought in a rational way.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Attracta Mooney in London", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3a2b087d-0e54-414b-aa3a-0f23b15eeabe"}, {"uuid4": "34a010c6-e7fa-4c72-9713-64ac435d3663", "title": "Private chef\u2019s notebook: how to dodge the chaos of client kitchens", "description": "Sometimes the key to client-chef tranquility is to barely set foot in their home", "author": "Rosa Shipley", "published_date": "2025-01-25T05:00:52.242Z", "content": "When scrolling social media, I often land in the world of private-chef-tok: TikTok accounts run by people who do the same job I do of cooking in homes. This genre is immensely popular, in part for how visually pleasing these videos can be: luxurious kitchens, pristine counters, a pace of work that is somehow both zippy and unhurried.\n\nBut cooking from a client\u2019s home rarely looks like it does on social media. A kitchen is the heart of the home, the backdrop of groggy mornings, standing-up snacks and behind-the-scenes moments. I live and work in New York City, where the home is often the only oasis in the surrounding chaos. It didn\u2019t take me long to learn that when I enter a client\u2019s space as a person who is there to do a job, some of that tranquility gets unsettled.\n\nOften, clients don\u2019t totally know how to act. Should they talk to me? Can they speak frankly with one another while I\u2019m there? Sometimes clients fire off mid-recipe requests (I won\u2019t forget the diabetic who kept requesting bacon as I cooked him oatmeal). And I, of course, carry a low-level hum of anxiety with me. What if I break the heirloom knife? What if I spill flour all over myself? Am I meant to be keeping an eye on that toddler? I don\u2019t blame my clients for one second. Why shouldn\u2019t they move through their home freely?\n\nAll this has led me to an unconventional place: I am a private chef who prefers not to cook in my client\u2019s homes. I know how that sounds. One would assume that part of the job is producing food quickly and at close quarters, but I interpret good personal cheffing as something intimate, as opposed to immediate.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019ll never say a hard no to cooking in someone\u2019s home, but my preferred set-up holds surprising value for both of us. First, it removes the unnecessary hours of hauling around ingredients, knife kits etc that come with performing one\u2019s work in another person\u2019s space. Second, clients don\u2019t have to see the less glamorous elements of how the sausage is made \u2014 me scaling fish or peeling garlic or pounding cutlets. People who have hired a chef are often looking for some extra support, and doing these tasks away from their intimate space allows for it to stay uncomplicated and uncompromised. In my own space, I work quietly and quickly. The food is my only focus. My attention can go towards making the best experience for the client, as opposed to worrying about how the process looks.\n\nThe choice is also practical (and a bit bittersweet). Private cheffing relies on a strange relationship, one built on care but, ultimately, transactional. When budgets tighten, the chef is often the first cut. Cooking off-site keeps it sustainable for both sides. The idea of cooking in a separate space, then, isn\u2019t an avoidance of the intimacy that comes from the work; it\u2019s in fact in the interest of protecting it.\n\nI know personal chefs who have no problem showing up in someone\u2019s home, cooking and leaving. For them, work stays in the kitchen, whereas I seem to carry it with me.\n\nIn many ways, this is why aspirational private-chef-tok is so attractive to consume. No mess, no heavy loading of ingredients in and out of space, and \u2014 crucially \u2014 no clients! Just someone cooking on camera, in good light, for someone invisible.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend Magazine on X and FT Weekend on Instagram", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b076b820-9201-428d-a2fc-2c641876d57d"}, {"uuid4": "3e96afca-5c5f-4189-a8e3-02d7670b3dce", "title": "Swamp Notes: Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018vendetta agenda\u2019", "description": "Trump promised \u2018retribution\u2019 during his election campaign.

She also alleged that he had abused alcohol for years.\n\nThe former Fox News host is a departure from the typical defence secretary. His predecessor, Lloyd Austin, was a retired army general who oversaw US Central Command, which encompasses military operations in the Middle East.\n\nA vocal opponent of \u201cwokeness\u201d, Hegseth has vowed to bring a \u201cwarrior\u201d culture back to the US military as the Trump administration moves to do away with the federal government\u2019s diversity initiatives.\n\nHe also said one of his priorities will be to secure the US-Mexico border. The Pentagon on Wednesday said it would send an additional 1,500 active duty troops to the US\u2019s southern border, a 60 per cent increase, on the president\u2019s orders.\n\nMcConnell said he voted against Hegseth because the nominee lacks the \u201cstrategic vision\u201d for how to address the US\u2019s greatest national security challenges.\n\nHegseth \u201cprovided no substantial observations on how to defend Taiwan or the Philippines\u201d and did not \u201carticulate in any detail a strategic vision for dealing with\u201d with China, McConnell said. The incoming defence secretary also failed to demonstrate he can manage the Pentagon effectively.\n\nOn Thursday, Murkowski said she could not vote for him \u201cin good conscience\u201d, while Collins said she was \u201cnot convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed\u201d.\n\nAhead of the vote, Trump told reporters on Friday that he \u201cwas very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that\u201d, adding that \u201cPete\u2019s a very, very good man\u201d.\n\nHe also anticipated that McConnell would be a hold out too: \u201cOf course, Mitch is always a \u2018no\u2019 vote, I guess.\u201d\n\nTrump shocked Washington and defence circles when he selected Hegseth, who served in the Army National Guard, for the role. He has since been dogged by allegations of sexual assault, alcohol abuse, misogyny, sexism and racism.\n\nHegseth said in written answers to questions that he paid $50,000 to the woman who accused him of sexual assault in a California hotel room in 2017, according to Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nHegseth dismissed the allegations about the sexual assault, his character and preparedness for the top Pentagon job as \u201ca smear campaign\u201d at his Senate confirmation hearing last week. He also tried to revise his previous statements about women soldiers, saying they would \u201chave access to ground combat roles, given the standards remain high\u201d.\n\nOn air Hegseth became known for denouncing diversity, equity and inclusive initiatives. DEI policies in the military were \u201cdividing troops\u201d and forcing \u201ccommanders to walk on eggshells\u201d, Hegseth said at his hearing.\n\nMore Senate confirmation fireworks could come when two other contentious cabinet nominees, Robert F Kennedy Jr and Tulsi Gabbard, are grilled by senators on January 29 and January 30, respectively. Both ex-Democrats, Kennedy has been tapped for health secretary and Gabbard for director of national intelligence.", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/207424ee-2c60-422f-97e1-6b99ca1b5b2e"}, {"uuid4": "2a19d347-1ed8-4374-a4e4-1062107e533a", "title": "Marco Rubio demands immediate halt to virtually all US foreign aid", "description": "Secretary of state freezes contracts around the world, fulfilling executive order from Donald Trump", "author": "James Politi", "published_date": "2025-01-24T20:37:12.731Z", "content": "US secretary of state Marco Rubio has ordered an immediate halt to work on virtually all existing foreign aid programmes pending a review into whether they are consistent with President Donald Trump\u2019s policies, according to an internal cable seen by the Financial Times.\n\nThe move will affect international assistance contracts administered by Washington, including through the US Agency for International Development, worth billions of dollars and spanning countries around the world.\n\nIn the cable sent to the state department and USAID on Friday, Rubio said that all new foreign aid disbursements were to be suspended, and contracting officers and grant officers needed to \u201cimmediately issue stop-work orders\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009until such time as the secretary shall determine, following a review\u201d.\n\nThe review period is expected to last as long as 85 days, leaving the fate of hundreds of US foreign aid contracts, which were worth more than $70bn in the 2022 fiscal year, potentially in limbo for as long as three months.\n\nRubio also ordered that all foreign aid disbursed through any agency or department be approved by the secretary of state, centralising the vetting of all international assistance programmes within his office.\n\nRubio\u2019s cable implements an executive order signed by Trump on his first day in office. In it the president bashed the \u201cforeign aid industry and bureaucracy\u201d as \u201cnot aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values\u201d, and asked for assistance to be suspended.\n\nIn the first days of his second term in the White House, Trump has taken aggressive steps to reshape and redirect all agencies of the US government to implement his policies.\n\nScientific agencies such as the National Institutes of Health have also paused grant work pending review by the new administration, alarming researchers.\n\nThere are some exceptions to Rubio\u2019s aid freeze order, among them \u201capproved waivers\u201d for military financing for Israel and Egypt, as well as foreign emergency food aid. But the cable said that in addition to pausing new and existing contracts, US government agencies, including USAID, must stop publishing proposals for foreign aid projects.\n\nEarlier this week, Rubio said in a statement that Trump had asked him \u201cto place our core national interest as the guiding mission of American foreign policy\u201d, saying among his top priorities were curbing mass migration and scrapping climate policies that \u201cweaken\u201d America.\n\n\u201cEvery dollar we spend, every programme we fund, and every policy we pursue must be justified with the answer to three simple questions:\u00a0Does it make America safer?\u00a0Does it make America stronger?\u00a0Does it make America more prosperous?\u201d\n\nThe state department has been approached for comment.", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/45fc5347-7f2c-4a99-9d4e-e561eb5a9285"}, {"uuid4": "99333f0c-9dc7-4f2b-820d-05c21f598885", "title": "Trump\u2019s new economic war ", "description": "The president\u2019s ultimatums and demands on allies and rivals suggest he will use America\u2019s financial might as a cudgel", "author": "Keith Fray", "published_date": "2025-01-24T19:07:00.974Z", "content": "The televised image of Donald Trump towered over delegates in a conference hall in the ski resort of Davos on Thursday, embodying the outsized impact the new president has had just a few days into his second term in the Oval Office.\n\nPrime ministers, business leaders and the president of the European Central Bank had queued up to see him address the World Economic Forum, his first speech to a global audience since returning to the White House. One attendee joked about fetching some popcorn for the show.\n\nTrump did not hold back, provoking nervous laughter as he issued a series of demands and ultimatums to allies and rivals alike.\n\nSaudi Arabia and other producers must cut oil prices, global central banks \u201cimmediately\u201d needed to slash interest rates, and foreign companies must ramp up investments in US factories or face tariffs. The EU \u2014 which came in for particular opprobrium \u2014 must stop hitting big American technology companies with competition fines.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be demanding respect from other nations,\u201d the president said. His predecessor had \u201callowed other nations to take advantage of the US. We can\u2019t allow that to happen any more.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s demands came amid a frenetic first week in office in which the president launched a blitzkrieg of executive orders and announcements intended not just to reshape the state but also assert America\u2019s economic and commercial supremacy. Tariffs of up to 25 per cent could be slapped on Canada and Mexico as early as February 1, riding roughshod over the trade deal Trump himself negotiated in his first term.\n\nChina could face levies of up to 100 per cent if Beijing failed to agree on a deal to sell at least 50 per cent of the TikTok app to a US company, while the EU was told to purchase more American oil if it wanted to avoid tariffs. Underscoring the new American unilateralism, Trump pulled the US out of the World Health Organization, as well as exiting the Paris climate accord for a second time.\n\nStrikingly, Trump reached for an obscure, 90-year-old provision in the US tax code to threaten a doubling of tax rates for foreign nationals and companies if their home countries were deemed to have imposed \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d taxes on American multinationals.\n\nThis proposal throws a \u201chand grenade\u201d at international tax policymaking, says Niels Johannesen, director of the Oxford university Centre for Business Taxation at Sa\u00efd Business School. The move suggests a determination to \u201cshape other countries\u2019 tax policy through coercion rather than through co-operation\u201d, he adds.\n\nThe plans unveiled this week by the new president raise the spectre of a multi-front economic war as Trump uses the power of America\u2019s resurgent economy to rebalance the international order in his favour.\n\nThe key question, say investors and policymakers, is whether this amounts to a more intense version of the transactional, dealmaking approach seen in Trump\u2019s first term, or a shift towards unbridled unilateralism, where a White House unbound by the constraints of international law cajoles and intimidates foreign governments and businesses.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s weaponising everything: trade, tax and energy. I\u2019m worried that finance will get weaponised too,\u201d says the head of one of the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth funds. \u201cMost people are betting that he cares about the stock market \u2014 that\u2019s the only check. That and the fact that he has said he wants to be a peacemaker.\u201d\n\nIn Davos, leading US executives were eager to cheer Trump\u2019s agenda \u2014 suggesting there is little anxiety within the corporate sector about the US potentially rupturing the global rules-based order.\n\nTariffs are an \u201ceconomic tool. That\u2019s it,\u201d said Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, in a CNBC interview at Davos this week. \u201cIf it\u2019s a little inflationary, but it\u2019s good for national security, so be it. Get over it.\u201d\n\nThe US stock market rallied this week as investors digested the prospect of an easing of regulations governing banks and high-technology companies, as well as the announcement of a massive $100bn artificial intelligence infrastructure project launched by OpenAI and SoftBank.\u00a0By the end of the week (as of late Friday afternoon in New York), the S&P 500 index was up 1.8 per cent.\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, people talk to CEOs and say they all feel super-positive,\u201d says Mahmood Pradhan, head of global macro at Amundi Investment Institute.\n\n\u201cIf I ask myself what justifies the animal spirits, the banking deregulation stuff is real and the prospect of lower corporate taxes is real.\u201d\n\nYet, outside the US, the threat of a widening array of trade barriers and conflicts over tax policies is weighing on the economic outlook. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU\u2019s economics commissioner, says a fracturing of global trade would be of particular worry to economies like Europe, where trade accounts for more than a fifth of GDP.\n\nHe cites IMF estimates showing that extreme geoeconomic fragmentation in trade could wipe out 7 per cent of global GDP over the medium run.\u00a0\u201cIf this global economic fragmentation settles in \u2014 and there is\u00a0a risk of that \u2014 it is going to have sizeable negative economic consequences.\u201d\n\nEven while bracing for a tariff onslaught, though, some European policymakers claim to see potential upsides.\n\n\u201cIt is a new environment which is definitely less comfortable for Europe, but which also offers a lot of opportunities,\u201d says Alexander de Croo, Belgium\u2019s prime minister. \u201cEurope can show there that we have stability and that you are in a predictable environment where investment can take place.\u201d\n\nEuropean officials also say they could benefit from deeper trade ties with other countries that may be squeezed out of US markets. \u201cCountries are coming to us because they want to diversify away from the US,\u201d says a senior EU official.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep on being open but not being naive,\u201d says Spanish economy minister Carlos Cuerpo. \u201cWe need to have our companies competing under equal footing, equal conditions and a level playing field with respect to others. That was the case with China. That will need to be the case also with the US.\u201d\n\nWhile the US and Europe have long railed against Chinese trade practices, Beijing was quick this week to present itself as an upholder of the global, rules-based order rather than its nemesis.\n\nSpeaking the day after Trump was inaugurated, Chinese vice-premier Ding Xuexiang insisted that economic globalisation \u201cis not a \u2018you lose, I win\u2019, zero-sum game\u201d. The largest countries of the world needed to \u201clead by example\u201d he said, praising international bodies including the World Trade Organization and UN.\n\nThe irony of China presenting itself as a free-trading paragon while Trump seeks to extract concessions from his closest allies by brute economic force was not lost on Davos attendees watching Ding\u2019s performance.\n\nDespite the barrage of measures and statements fired out by the White House this week, most global policymakers are taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump\u2019s aggressive transactionalism, rather than leaping to conclusions about the longer-term ramifications for the global economic system.\n\n\u201cWhy put my cards on the table before he has?\u201d says the senior EU official.\n\nJonathan Reynolds, the UK\u2019s business secretary, acknowledges there remain \u201clots of questions\u201d about the president\u2019s approach. \u201cIs it about leverage around negotiations? Is it about revenue-raising in terms of tariffs?\u201d The UK, he says, will continue to argue for a \u201cmuch more open, global trading economy.\u201d\n\nThere is little question, however, that Trump is signalling a significant escalation in how he will wield trade as a weapon compared with his first term.\n\n\u201cThose around Trump have had time to build up a systematic, methodological approach for protectionist trade policy and it shows,\u201d says former UK trade department official Allie Renison, now at consultancy SEC Newgate. The approach will be to build up a case file of \u201cevidence\u201d against countries, she says, and then use it to extract concessions in areas of both economic and foreign policy.\n\nThe question remains how far Trump is willing to go. The danger of trampling on the rules-based order, says Jeromin Zettelmeyer, head of the Bruegel think-tank, is a complete breakdown in the diplomatic and legal channels for settling international disputes.\n\nIf Trump were to pull out of a wider range of international frameworks, such as the WTO or the IMF, he warns, then the arrangements that help govern the global economy could get \u201csubstantively destroyed\u201d.\n\nThe extreme case, he adds, is that \u201cthey really do a Putin\u201d \u2014 namely by violating the sanctity of international borders. Taking control of Greenland or the Panama Canal by force, as Trump has threatened, would amount to \u201cthe reintroduction of the law of the jungle\u201d.\n\nMichael Strain, director of Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute think-tank, questions whether Trump will reverse the \u201cfundamental forces\u201d that drive global economic integration \u2014 and whether the president even wants to do so. But regardless, he says, the uncertainty about his true intentions \u201cmakes it hard for business to plan, creates a chilling effect on investment, and creates tensions with our allies.\u201d\n\nSome caution against being awestruck by Trump\u2019s threats or his espousal of capitalism without limits, because his agenda was so incoherent.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is huge doses of American hubris,\u201d says Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez, dean of the Paris School of International Affairs at Sciences Po. \u201cWe are blinded by the intensity of all the issues put on the table and by Trump\u2019s conviction. But we are not looking at the contradictions. It\u2019s like we are all on an orange drug.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Harriet Agnew in Davos and Peter Foster in London\n\nData visualisation by Keith Fray", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f5006dab-8d12-4dbd-b053-3e3c70eb028c"}, {"uuid4": "1c5bc6a0-b398-4c65-990e-2c6e3e9e0570", "title": "Dollar falls after Donald Trump hints at softer stance on China tariffs", "description": "US president also says he would like to see interest rates fall \u2018a lot\u2019", "author": "Jennifer Hughes", "published_date": "2025-01-24T18:51:32.558Z", "content": "The dollar was on course for its biggest weekly fall in more than a year on Friday after US President Donald Trump suggested a potentially softer stance on tariffs against China and called for interest rates to fall.\n\nThe dollar slid 0.7 per cent against a basket of currencies after Trump said he would \u201crather not\u201d hit China with tariffs. Over the week, it has lost 1.8 per cent, its worst performance since July 2023.\n\nTrump also reiterated calls for looser monetary policy, saying he knew rates \u201cmuch better\u201d than the Federal Reserve and would like to see them fall \u201ca lot\u201d.\n\nThe euro, which has fallen sharply in recent months, jumped 0.9 per cent to $1.051, putting it on course for its largest weekly gain since November 2022. Sterling also gained 0.3 per cent to $1.249, on course for its strongest week in more than two years.\n\n\u201cThe main driver of the reversal of US dollar strength this week has been the scaling-back of investor fears over disruption to global trade from Trump\u2019s tariff plans,\u201d said Lee Hardman, senior currency strategist at MUFG, adding that these fears had \u201ceased further\u201d overnight on the China comments.\n\nMexico\u2019s peso, which has been hit hard by tariff worries, rose 0.6 per cent to 20.3 per dollar, poised for its best week in four months.\n\nAdarsh Sinha, strategist at Bank of America, said there was a persistent gap between where interest rates suggested the dollar should trade, which would be below its current price, and the level if the risk of tariffs were priced in \u2014 a threat still expected to loom large despite Trump\u2019s latest comments.\n\n\u201cEven with tariffs delayed, they are likely to be a key policy pillar for the new administration,\u201d Sinha added. \u201cMore importantly, uncertainty remains high with President Trump.\u201d\n\nThe resilience of the US central bank to pressure from the new president is a core theme for this year, fund managers say.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is going to be huge on the Fed,\u201d said Olivier De Larouzi\u00e8re, chief investment officer for global fixed income at BNP Paribas Asset Management.\n\nThere were \u201cgood reasons\u201d for investors in the coming quarters to start to price in rate rises for 2026, he added, and so the market would be \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d the Fed\u2019s communications over the coming months to see whether the Trump rhetoric was stopping that tightening bias coming through.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks come just days before the Fed\u2019s first policy meeting to be held during his administration.\n\nHowever, markets have been betting since early October that Trump\u2019s proposals for trade tariffs and tax cuts would stoke inflation, pushing the Fed to potentially hold off from further rate cuts.\n\nThe US central bank is widely expected to keep rates at their current level of 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent next week after lowering them by a full percentage point since September.\n\nInvestors priced in a slightly greater chance of earlier rate cuts this year after Trump\u2019s remarks. Another quarter-point cut is expected in June or July.\n\nDespite the president\u2019s efforts to steer monetary policy lower, some investors believe the central bank will have limited room to cut further, with the dollar expected to continue its rally of recent months.\n\nDan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at $2tn asset manager Pimco, told the Financial Times this week that the Fed was poised to keep rates on hold \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d and could even increase borrowing costs.\n\nAsian currencies, including the Japanese yen and Indian rupee, strengthened against the dollar following Trump\u2019s comments. The offshore Chinese yuan gained 0.5 per cent to Rmb7.25 to the dollar, its highest level since late November.\n\nIn early January the Chinese currency breached the 7.30 level as traders positioned for the impact of tariffs on Chinese exports to weaken the currency, but it has strengthened since Trump\u2019s inauguration.", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/59eb6186-7c61-433d-991a-46946e0e9dea"}, {"uuid4": "ab43fb00-0aad-4e90-bf5e-4462321acda3", "title": "Mexico and Canada forge united front in face of Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats", "description": "US trade partners warn new measures would harm consumers in all three countries", "author": "Ilya Gridneff", "published_date": "2025-01-24T18:38:59.983Z", "content": "Mexico and Canada are putting aside their differences and forming a more united front as they try to head off US President Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose steep tariffs on them as soon as next week.\n\nSince winning the election in November Trump has repeatedly threatened his country\u2019s two largest trading partners with tariffs of 25 per cent on all exports to the US in retaliation for what he says are rising levels of illegal immigration and the trafficking of the opioid fentanyl into the country. He has warned the tariffs could apply from February 1.\n\n\u201cTrump is black and white about this,\u201d said a person familiar with the Trump team\u2019s plans. \u201cWe give you access to the US market, what are you giving us?\u201d\n\nMexico and Canada send three-quarters of their exports to the US underpinned by a three-way trade agreement, USMCA, that was signed during Trump\u2019s last presidency, making them vulnerable to demands from Washington.\n\nMexico relies on the US for about 70 per cent of its natural gas and has long been blamed by Trump for illegal migrants and drugs coming into the US.\n\nThe Canadian chamber of commerce predicts the country\u2019s GDP would shrink 2.6 per cent or roughly C$78bn (US$54bn), if Trump made good on his threats, costing Canadians about C$1,900 per person annually.\n\nDespite the shared threat from Trump, the Mexico-Canada relationship soured last year, initially over Ottawa\u2019s ambassador raising concerns over an overhaul of the Mexican judiciary.\n\nThey worsened significantly in November after Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hinted he would be open to cutting Mexico out of USMCA and agreed with Trump that Chinese investment in Mexico was problematic, in an apparent attempt to curry favour with the newly elected president.\n\nThese and other comments prompted fury in Mexico City but the two countries are coming together in the face of Trump\u2019s tariff warning, with a flurry of calls between ministers taking place in the past month, officials said.\n\n\u201cPolitical noise may have caused delays and clouded judgments in Ottawa, but Canadians might have finally realised that better co-ordination with Mexico is crucial,\u201d said Diego Marroquin Bitar, the Bersin-Foster North America Scholar at the Wilson Centre think-tank.\n\nA key aim of the rapprochement has been to align the countries\u2019 narratives of how US tariffs would be a lose-lose proposition that would push prices up for consumers in all three countries.\n\nTrudeau this week said: \u201cTrump has announced he wants a \u2018golden age\u2019 for the American economy. That means they\u2019re going to need more energy, more minerals, more steel and aluminium, more lumber, more concrete, more of the things Canada is already sending them.\u201d\n\nOttawa and Mexico City have also have drawn up separate lists of retaliatory tariffs, while simultaneously sending public and private olive branches to the Trump team on border security, said people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMexico has readied tariffs dubbed locally as a \u201ccarousel\u201d of products squeezed for a few months before they are switched to other states targeting key Republican lawmakers.\n\nCanada has also signalled it is preparing tit-for-tat sanctions that would create \u201cthe greatest amount of angst in the US with the least amount of pain in Canada\u201d, said Jonathan Wilkinson, minister of energy and natural resources.\n\nA review of USMCA set for 2026 is under way, with Trump pressing for changes to reduce China\u2019s footprint in the region. Public consultations began this week in Washington and the president has asked the US trade representative to make recommendations on the pact\u2019s future by April 1.\n\nOttawa and Mexico City are bracing for Trump to push for a renegotiation of USMCA \u2014 which the president renegotiated during his first term in what he called a \u201ccolossal victory for American workers\u201d \u2014 rather than the loosely defined but narrower \u201creview\u201d scheduled under the pact.\n\n\u201cIt is his to play with, it is his to refashion,\u201d said Andrew Shoyer, a former USTR official and now trade lawyer at Sidley Austin.\n\nPeople familiar with the White House\u2019s plans say the US wants to make changes to limit foreign content in cars and to curtail growing Chinese links to Mexico\u2019s economy.\n\nTrump has also raised the US\u2019s high trade deficits with the two USMCA partners, warning Ottawa that Washington could use \u201ceconomic force\u201d to make Canada the country\u2019s 51st state.\n\nCanada \u201ccan always become a state, and if you\u2019re a state, we won\u2019t have a deficit\u201d, he told the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need their lumber, because we have our own forests. We don\u2019t need their oil and gas. We have more than anybody,\u201d he added.\n\nIn fact, the US imports about 40 per cent of the crude it refines, with 60 per cent of that coming from Canada and 11 per cent from Mexico.\n\n\u201cImposing tariffs will adversely affect not only American consumers but also American energy security interests,\u201d said Mark Scholz, the chief executive of the Canadian Association of Energy Contractors.\n\nCanada has responded to Trump\u2019s border demands, pledging to spend more than $1bn on security with helicopters, drones and increased manpower \u2014 although Trudeau on Thursday noted only 1 per cent of the illegal migrants and illicit drugs entering the US come from Canada.\n\nMexico has also stepped up immigration enforcement and will now take back asylum applicants waiting out their US claims.\n\nTrump has threatened to deploy the US special forces to Mexico to take out drug cartels, and said in Davos that the US was also \u201cdealing with Mexico very well\u201d.\n\nHis approach has had a dramatic effect on what are usually routine amendment procedures in most trade deals, Shoyer said.\n\n\u201cThis is maximum chaos, shock and awe\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009he\u2019s using all this as leverage,\u201d he said.\n\nData visualisation by Alan Smith", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/77b2bd4f-4b2e-4b03-9668-5e3bb5c9c37f"}, {"uuid4": "d8a4ecc5-9fee-49dd-b788-26b5dcee903e", "title": "Donald Trump in fiery call with Denmark\u2019s prime minister over Greenland", "description": "US president insisted he wants to take over Arctic island ", "author": "James Politi", "published_date": "2025-01-24T18:03:51.553Z", "content": "Donald Trump insisted he was serious in his determination to take over Greenland in a fiery telephone call with Denmark\u2019s prime minister, according to senior European officials.\n\nThe US president spoke to Mette Frederiksen, the Danish premier, for 45 minutes last week. The White House has not commented on the call but Frederiksen said she had emphasised that the vast Arctic island \u2014 an autonomous part of the kingdom of Denmark \u2014 was not for sale, while noting America\u2019s \u201cbig interest\u201d in it.\n\nFive current and former senior European officials briefed on the call said the conversation had gone very badly.\n\nThey added that Trump had been aggressive and confrontational following the Danish prime minister\u2019s comments that the island was not for sale, despite her offer of more co-operation on military bases and mineral exploitation.\n\n\u201cIt was horrendous,\u201d said one of the people. Another added: \u201cHe was very firm. It was a cold shower. Before, it was hard to take it seriously. But I do think it is serious, and potentially very dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe details of the call are likely to deepen European concerns that Trump\u2019s return to power will strain transatlantic ties more than ever, as the US president heaps pressure on allies to give up territory.\n\nTrump has started his second term musing about potentially taking over Greenland, the Panama Canal, and even Canada.\n\nMany European officials had hoped his comments about seeking control of Greenland for \u201cnational security\u201d reasons were a negotiating ploy to gain more influence over the Nato territory. Russia and China are both also jostling for position in the Arctic.\n\nBut the call with Frederiksen has crushed such hopes, deepening the foreign policy crisis between the Nato allies.\n\n\u201cThe intent was very clear. They want it. The Danes are now in crisis mode,\u201d said one person briefed on the call. Another said: \u201cThe Danes are utterly freaked out by this.\u201d\n\nA former Danish official added: \u201cIt was a very tough conversation. He threatened specific measures against Denmark such as targeted tariffs.\u201d\n\nThe Danish prime minister\u2019s office said it did \u201cnot recognise the interpretation of the conversation given by anonymous sources\u201d.\n\nGreenland, home to just 57,000 people, is an entry point to new shipping routes gradually opening up through the Arctic; it also boasts abundant but hard to access minerals.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has been clear that the safety and security of Greenland is important to the United States as China and Russia make significant investments throughout the Arctic region,\u201d a White House National Security Council spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThe President is committed to not only protecting US interests in the Arctic but also working with Greenland to ensure mutual prosperity for both nations.\u201d\n\nTrump threatened in early January to impose duties on Denmark if it opposed him on Greenland. He also declined to rule out using military force to take control of the island.\n\n\u201cPeople really don\u2019t even know if Denmark has any legal right to it but, if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security,\u201d Trump said at a press conference days before taking office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about protecting the free world,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We\u2019re not letting that happen.\u201d\n\nM\u00fate Egede, Greenland\u2019s prime minister, has repeatedly stressed that the island\u2019s inhabitants want independence rather than US \u2014 or Danish \u2014 citizenship. But he has welcomed US business interest in mining and tourism.\n\nFrederiksen held a meeting with chief executives of large Danish companies including Novo Nordisk and Carlsberg last week to discuss Trump\u2019s threats, including potential tariffs against her country.\n\nOn the day of the Trump call, she told Denmark\u2019s TV2: \u201cThere is no doubt that there is great interest in and around Greenland. Based on the conversation I had today, there is no reason to believe that it should be less than what we have heard in the public debate.\u201d", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ace02a6f-3307-43f8-aac3-16b6646b60f6"}, {"uuid4": "b95650e2-a2f9-4fa6-b1bd-5793d069a962", "title": "Animal spirits in markets risk running too far", "description": "Giddy investors have pushed up stocks in one of the stronger opening months to any year in the past decade", "author": "Katie Martin", "published_date": "2025-01-24T18:00:50.366Z", "content": "Now would be a good time for investors to curb their enthusiasm, just a little. This year has begun with the bulls largely in control. Already, US stocks have risen about 4 per cent, making this one of the stronger opening months to any year in the past decade.\n\nThe re-inauguration of Donald Trump as US president has ushered in a new period of \u201canimal spirits\u201d among business executives, as veteran investor Stan Druckenmiller put it this week. Chief executives are \u201csomewhere between relieved and giddy\u201d at the election result, he told CNBC. Meanwhile, US banks are in \u201cgo-mode\u201d, a senior JPMorgan executive told the Davos crowd, while crypto is on the cusp of entering the \u201cbanana zone\u201d, according to its boosters. (Nope, me neither. Apparently that\u2019s good, though, indicating prices are about to surge.)\n\nHSBC is sticking with the good vibes. Its multi-asset team this week outlined an \u201cextremely positive\u201d backdrop for risky assets in the first half of this year \u2014 a scenario it described as \u201cGoldilocks on steroids\u201d, quite the mental image.\n\nAt the risk of spoiling all the fun, some market watchers \u2014 including some of the optimists \u2014 are getting a little nervous. The first big reason is the global government bond market, which has got off to a wobbly start to the year. This is not entirely a bad thing \u2014 it reflects a continuation of the US economic growth miracle. But it also reflects an expectation that inflation will continue to stick around and that the Federal Reserve will therefore struggle to keep reducing interest rates \u2014 no matter how much Trump would like it to. On the margins, it also suggests asset managers demand a somewhat higher rate of return for feeding government coffers.\n\nWhatever your preferred narrative here, the point is that bond investors have been wrongfooted (again) and that the resulting drop in prices has pushed yields up (again). The most important benchmark of them all \u2014 the US 10-year yield \u2014 is sitting well above 4.5 per cent. That marks a recovery in prices since mid-January but is still high enough to undermine the case for loading up on stocks.\n\nAs my colleagues reported this week, US stocks have now reached their most expensive point relative to bonds in a generation. It is becoming ever harder to justify venturing further into stocks when their expected profits compared with earnings have sunk so far below the risk-free rate.\n\nPeter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, noted at an event at the bank\u2019s swanky London office this week that stocks had largely shrugged off this competition from bonds so far \u2014 in large part because optimism around growth is so strong. But that leaves equities now \u201cvulnerable to further rises in yields\u201d.\n\nIt is mildly silly but nonetheless true that much here depends on round numbers, which act as useful psychological signposts to investors. The big test would be if US yields hit 5 per cent. At that point, one of two things would happen: the bond haters would capitulate and snap up some bargains to pull the yield back down again, or selling would intensify and every asset class would feel the pain. My strong hunch is the former.\n\nWe are not at that point yet, but as Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, put it this week, \u201cwe\u2019re still at a critical level\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really getting close to the zip code where slightly slower growth and slightly higher rates become a deadly combination for the markets,\u201d she said. As a result, she is sceptical that equities in general, and highly concentrated, highly tech-dependent US stock markets in particular, can continue the spectacular run of the past two years. Shalett is anticipating gains in US stocks of between 5 and 10 per cent this year. That is not bad, by any stretch, but it would not be a repeat of the 20 per cent-plus performance in each of the past two years.\n\nAnother factor tapping on the alarm bells is the level of optimism itself, especially among retail investors. The American Association of Individual Investors reported that sentiment had \u201cskyrocketed\u201d in its latest monthly survey. Expectations that stock prices will rise over the next six months jumped by some 18 percentage points to January, the AAII said.\n\nEven optimistic wealth managers, who advise a lot of these investors, are having a hard time holding them back. Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist for Baird Private Wealth Management, told me this week that he believes in the bull market, albeit with half an eye on bond yields, which have moved \u201cup and to the right with no obvious reason\u201d. But he sees anecdotal signs that the American exceptionalism theme is becoming overly entrenched among his clients. \u201cI\u2019m starting to get questions about whether you need to diversify at all,\u201d he said.\n\nNone of this is a reason to run to the hills and shelter in the safest assets you can find. But the air is getting somewhat thin at these heights and the potential for slip-ups from the new US presidential administration is strong. Glassy-eyed optimism rarely ends well, no matter how muscly Goldilocks becomes.\n\nkatie.martin@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4d3eed1b-22aa-437f-8337-460f00e35363"}, {"uuid4": "971da95f-fb00-4e45-b40b-11110bb0a38e", "title": "US securities regulator opens door for Wall Street banks to hold crypto", "description": "Securities and Exchange Commission overturns guidance that made it costly to hold digital assets for clients", "author": "Brooke Masters", "published_date": "2025-01-24T17:25:10.615Z", "content": "Wall Street\u2019s securities watchdog has made it easier for banks to expand their cryptocurrency businesses by overturning a Joe Biden administration rule that made it prohibitively expensive to hold digital assets.\n\nIn one of the first pro-crypto moves of Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency, the Securities and Exchange Commission late on Thursday reversed guidance known as SAB 121, which had called for institutions to treat digital tokens held for customers as liabilities on balance sheets.\n\nThe shift underscores expectations that Trump will take a far more welcoming approach towards the digital asset sector, undoing the more sceptical stance the SEC took during Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nMainstream groups are taking more serious interest in crypto assets and technologies, with BlackRock chief Larry Fink this week calling on the SEC to \u201crapidly approve\u201d the ability of companies to create tokens backed by stocks and bonds.\n\nIn a sign of Trump\u2019s more supportive crypto strategy, the president on Thursday had also issued an executive order laying out his priorities regarding cryptocurrencies and calling for cabinet-level officials to report back several months from now with recommendations for regulatory and legislative proposals.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s pick to lead the SEC, Paul Atkins, is still awaiting US Senate confirmation, acting chair Mark Uyeda and another Republican commissioner, Hester Peirce, have put the regulator on a more crypto-friendly track, forming a task force and dismantling SAB 121.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s SAB 121 had \u201ccreated a punitive framework that effectively prevented US banks from offering custody services for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\u201d, said Mark Palmer, an equity research analyst at The Benchmark Company. \u201cTraditional banks will now be able to offer crypto custody services without facing de facto penalties.\u201d\n\nEven before the SEC took action, big US banks were eagerly anticipating the ability to court crypto customers as Trump and his allies in the executive and legislative branches smoothed the road for digital assets.\n\n\u201cWe do want to have the ability to offer spot crypto, and our expectation is that at some point, the regulations around crypto are going to allow us to do that,\u201d Rick Wurster, chief executive at Charles Schwab, told analysts on a call this week.\n\nThe American Bankers Association and other industry lobbyists last year called on Biden to formally disapprove of the SEC guidance after measures to do so passed both houses of Congress in May 2024.\n\n\u201cThis is a step in the right direction,\u201d said Kevin Fromer, president of the Financial Services Forum, which represents the biggest banks.\n\nBrian Daly, a lawyer at Akin Gump, noted custody services were \u201ca predicate to everything\u201d for financial institutions when offering crypto services to customers. The old rule \u201cbasically made it impossible for all the responsible banks and broker-dealers and financial intermediaries that we rely on to be crypto custodians\u201d, Daly said.\n\nThe price of bitcoin rose more than 1.5 per cent on Friday to about $105,800, shy of its all-time high of roughly $109,000.", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/24854c53-98ef-42b5-96ed-efd6f5b70271"}, {"uuid4": "5c5a2940-182b-4751-8042-6c5d125d8094", "title": "How to respond to Trump 2.0", "description": "America\u2019s partners must defend their values as well as their interests", "author": "The editorial board", "published_date": "2025-01-24T17:14:21.619Z", "content": "Donald Trump has started his second term as predicted: with a fusillade of executive orders, memos, vows, musings and overheated rhetoric. The world has had at least a year to brace itself for the return of the America First agenda to the White House. No one can say they are surprised by this approach, or by most of Trump\u2019s initiatives \u2014 radical and divisive as some of them are. Even so, his full-throated unleashing of the animal spirits of American capitalism has unnerved some traditional allies. Now the world has to decide how to respond to the whirlwind that seems set to accompany, if not encapsulate, Trump\u2019s second administration.\n\nAmerica, too, has a big question to answer. Much of the focus in the opening days of Trump\u2019s new presidency has been on issues that secured his re-election, in particular reducing immigration and cutting back what his supporters call the \u201cdeep state\u201d, otherwise known as the federal government. He is right to attend to the concerns of the voters who sent him back to the Oval Office. But how should Americans respond if, as his opponents fear, he indulges his baser instincts and starts undermining the pillars of its democracy?\n\nThere is a simple answer to both questions: values in addition to interests. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord cannot, for example, become an excuse for the EU to slow its decarbonisation agenda; it should, though, ease the regulatory burdens and simplify its rules.\n\nOn the domestic front, too, now is the time to pick the right fights. US courts should be prepared for a battle royal over Trump\u2019s more controversial initiatives, such as his bid to end birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the 14th amendment of the constitution.\n\nTrump\u2019s opening foray has underlined a widespread sense that an era has ended. It has met a wearied response from America\u2019s allies, who see it as intensifying the threats to the multilateral order. But it is important to note that many elsewhere in the world view Trump more favourably and like the idea of a more inward-looking America. It is possible, too, that some of his initiatives may have desirable outcomes. It will take more than Trump\u2019s threat of tougher sanctions on Russia to bring Vladimir Putin to the table to negotiate a fair peace deal in Ukraine. But the president\u2019s blunt \u2014 and unexpected \u2014 warning this week was a step in the right direction, as well as a reminder of how he sees unpredictability as an asset.\n\nMore broadly, allies have to accept that some of Trump\u2019s prescriptions may prove a much-needed call to action. Just as in his last term he prodded Nato\u2019s members to spend more on defence, this time his backing for less regulation and bureaucracy and lower taxes will force EU leaders to confront with greater urgency the continent\u2019s problem of competitiveness.\n\nThese are early days. The fact that Trump has not started a new trade war with China or Europe does not mean one will not be under way next week. Whatever unfolds, it is a time for cool heads. Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, told the Financial Times this week that he and other east Asian leaders thought that, after an initial period of turmoil, the global trading system would survive intact. We have to hope he is right.\n\nTrump is now at the height of his powers, controlling both houses of Congress, with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court and with the following wind of re-election. At home and abroad, it is vital not to be distracted by the more performative elements of his agenda, to accept that sometimes he may be right, but most of all to stand up for what matters.

Instead it was a policy wonk, Stephen Miller, the architect of Donald Trump\u2019s second-term policy agenda and anti-immigration ideologue.\n\n\u201cThey were so sure they were going to crush this movement out of existence,\u201d bellowed Miller as his fiery eight-minute address reached a peak. \u201cAnd yet here we stand today and Maga is stronger, more powerful, more united and more determined than ever before.\u201d\u00a0The crowd went wild.\n\nSince returning to the Oval Office, Trump has wasted no time in signing a blizzard of executive orders aimed at boosting oil production, curbing immigration, scrapping diversity initiatives and pardoning January 6 rioters, to name just a few. As the president put his name to the directives, Miller, the mastermind behind them, was standing just metres away.\n\n\u201cStephen, like the president, believes that we have a finite amount of time to save our country,\u201d says Jason Miller (no relation), a former Trump spokesperson. \u201cFor these early actions, I would say that Stephen is the key implementer-in-chief.\u201d\n\nMiller has been a Trump devotee from the early days of his first presidential campaign in 2016. Then a 30-year-old adviser, he crafted policy from behind a card table in a closet-sized office on the fifth floor of Trump tower.\n\nAssociates say his attention to detail stood out from the start. \u201cDuring discussion on policy he always knew the most about any topic being discussed \u2014 from 150-year-old esoteric immigration provisions to international postal treaties,\u201d says Hunter Morgen, his former deputy.\n\nMiller\u2019s loyalty has paid off. According to Mick Mulvaney, chief of staff during Trump\u2019s first administration, \u201cStephen is probably\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the closest to the president of anybody in the West Wing at this point, now that the family is not there. He\u2019s going to be one of the critical players. He\u2019s been with the president probably the longest of anybody who\u2019s in there. The president trusts him implicitly.\u201d\n\nAs he returns to the White House a battle-hardened policy veteran, Democrats are on high alert. \u201cHe\u2019s the second most dangerous man in America after the\u00a0president \u2014 and unlike the president he actually knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d says Jim Manley, a former longtime aide to the Senate Democratic leadership.\n\nMiller was born in Santa Monica, California in 1985. His rightwing zeal was apparent early. As a 16-year-old, he called into radio shows and wrote to local newspapers, railing against the \u201crampant political correctness\u201d he said was consuming his high school.\n\nIn a 2002 letter published in the Santa Monica Lookout, he hit out at bilingual announcements, the availability of contraception, the \u201cfoster[ing]\u201d of homosexuality, the failure to recite the pledge of allegiance and the negative depiction of US history. \u201cForget about being the nation that stopped Hitler, brought communism to its knees, and feeds more hungry people around the world than any other country \u2014 forget all of that, and let us just agree that we are a horrible nation. Or, we can raise our flags, lift our guns, and proclaim that we are Americans,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAfter studying at Duke University, he entered Republican politics, where he quickly made a name for himself. Former Tea Party congresswoman Michele Bachmann remembers him as a \u201cserious, tireless communications director who quickly proved his intellect and talent\u201d. Dave Brat, the economics professor who Miller helped oust House majority leader Eric Cantor in 2014, says he was a \u201cstraight shooter\u201d who put \u201cempirics\u201d over \u201cemotion\u201d.\n\nBut it was with Alabama senator Jeff Sessions that he honed his skills as a hype-man. Sessions previously told the Financial Times that he had asked Miller, then a staffer in his Senate office, to introduce him at an event when someone pulled out. Miller was so good in the role, according to Sessions, that he became a regular fixture.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential race, Sessions was one of the first Republicans to endorse Trump and Miller soon joined the real estate tycoon on the campaign trail. Trump often used the young ideologue as a warm-up act.\n\nBut it was in policy that Miller would make himself invaluable, putting into action the president\u2019s anti-immigration plans.

Bridges from the mainland were closed, as police dealt with downed power lines and scoured homes for survivors, or the bodies of victims, so he hitched a lift on a motorboat. After 20 minutes dodging unmoored vessels and other floating debris, they arrived at his dock, from where he surveyed the damage.\n\nThe receding storm surge had left 20 or so giant rubbish bins littered on the lawn. His neighbour\u2019s floating dock, detached in the storm, had become a battering ram, smashing a path through his patio doors for the oncoming water. Inside the house, where the toxic mess of gasoline, oils and sewage had reached nearly 4ft, furniture lay upended and strewn among seagrass and mud \u2014 a Baldwin upright piano, a grandfather clock, a refrigerator, broken precious glassware.\n\nFlorida\u2019s increasingly savage hurricane season had been growing its financial burden for years. Sawyer\u2019s insurance premiums, set at $4,000 per year when he arrived from Cincinnati 10 years earlier, had edged up to $7,500. Earlier in 2024, his fire and wind insurer had abruptly refused to renew his policy, precipitating a chaotic rush for a replacement before his lender\u00a0arranged its own exorbitantly priced substitute or withdrew\u00a0his mortgage.\n\nSoon, the dent left by Helene would make those items look like small change. By one estimate, up to $30bn of US property damage from the hurricane would turn out to be uninsured. By October, a neighbour four doors down, whose home had been valued at $940,000 before the hurricane hit, would have agreed to sell it for $699,000, the garden still full of the detritus carried there by the storm, just to get out. By Christmas, only seven of the 65 surrounding homes would be occupied, and half of Sawyer\u2019s immediate neighbours would have left for good.\n\nAll of this lay ahead of him, however. On that September morning, his mind was on the lost urn containing the remains of his mother and younger brother that he hadn\u2019t got around to scattering; it was on the thousands of photos he had planned to digitise someday, strewn through the home, matted together in dense clumps, their dyes slowly leaking into the salty water \u2014 family weddings, holidays, nieces and nephews growing up.\n\nFrom the boat, he contemplated the move from Cincinnati, the 10 years spent in the house, the damage its disfigurement would cause to the architecture of his memories. Surveying the desolation he wondered: had it been worth it?\n\nAcross the world, a slew of floods, wildfires and storms is shifting the balance of risk and reward attached to homes abutting forests, mountains, coasts and rivers.\n\nThe most visible impact is on those affected by catastrophe, who face the trauma and grief of a home\u2019s partial or total destruction, the financial shocks from underinsurance and the growing risk that, once rebuilt, even a new, safer home could be uninsurable.\n\nBut increasingly, even in locations seen as safe, homeowners are confronting spiralling insurance premiums and the prospect of a fall in capital values if insurers scale back or withdraw.\n\nHurricanes, fires and other disasters caused $320bn in losses last year, 30 per cent more than 2023, according to Munich Re, the world\u2019s largest reinsurance group. Insurers will be on the hook for $140bn of these, making 2024 the most expensive for the global industry since 2017, when the hurricane trio of Harvey, Irma and Maria struck the US.\n\nMany property markets in regions devastated by natural disaster have stopped in their tracks. Nearly three months after Valencia\u2019s devastating floods, mortgage approvals in the affected areas have almost entirely ceased as lenders await revised surveys to better understand the properties\u2019 risk, according to Juan Vill\u00e9n, head of the mortgage arm of Idealista, the Spanish property website.\u00a0\u201cBanks have ordered new appraisals to ensure that properties have not been affected by [the storm], before granting the loan,\u201d he says.\n\nAs insurers bear the weight of huge payouts across the world, the ripples are being felt in rising home insurance premiums in the safest locations.\n\nJoanna Shipton, one of six owners, has a flat in Marden Hill House, a Grade II*-listed house in Hertfordshire, about 90 minutes north of London, which dates from the 17th century.\u00a0Given the building\u2019s particular risks \u2014 including its age and listing, which makes repairs expensive \u2014 only one insurer will cover it, and the premium has increased from \u00a318,000 per year in 2019 to \u00a325,800 today.\n\n\u201cThey have us over a barrel,\u201d says Shipton, who is also treasurer of the management company the residents formed to run the building. Her share of the annual service charge is currently \u00a310,800; on top of that, higher energy prices mean bills for heating her poorly insulated home have rocketed in the past couple of years.\n\nShe and her husband listed their home for sale in August for \u00a32.7mn. Today, with the price cut to \u00a32.3mn, Shipton worries the high running costs may be putting buyers off.\n\n\u201cHousehold insurers have lost so much money they have become a lot fussier,\u201d says Clare Blakely of UK insurance broker Weatherbys Hamilton. They are now more reluctant to take on those with risk factors \u2014 such as a thatched roof, tall trees or water nearby. Since heavy rains caused extensive flooding in London in July 2021, questions about flat roofs, a cellar, lower ground floor or a basement have become standard, she adds.\n\nLast year, UK property insurance payouts hit their highest level for 20 years, according to Deloitte. Following years of underwriting losses, many are forecasting widespread premium increases: despite a surge for at-risk homes, the average price, adjusting for inflation, of a UK building and contents policy has not changed since 2017. In that time claims have increased by 72 per cent.\n\nBefore devastating wildfires erupted earlier this month in Los Angeles, the city\u2019s residents had long walked the tightrope between the glamour of its location and the risks.\n\n\u201cPacific Palisades, Pasadena, Santa Monica, these neighbourhoods have a charisma \u2014 storied, enchanting, so physically beautiful, so rich culturally and historically \u2014 despite being earthquake- and fire-prone,\u201d says John Vaillant, author of Fire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter World, which tells the story of the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire that tore through the bitumen mining area in Alberta, Canada. \u201cThat is a tension that west coast Americans are comfortable with.\u201d\n\nEven equipped with Vaillant\u2019s account, however, my conversation with Alisa Ruby Bash is disorientating. For the 49-year-old, arriving in Los Angeles aged 18 was the fulfilment of a dream. \u201cMy entire childhood I wanted to be an actress and a singer,\u201d she says. Fifteen years ago, her dream materialised into a home on Enchanted Way on the edge of Pacific Palisades. She had it all: a beautiful detached house in one of the city\u2019s most desirable neighbourhoods, \u201csafe from crime, surrounded by celebrities and successful people\u201d.\n\nBut on January 7, with only Palisades Drive between it and Topanga State Park, the house was one of the first to burn. In the rush to evacuate, her family left only with their passports, computers and the cat. \u201cMy home of 15 years, every single thing we own, all my belongings from my entire life [are gone],\u201d she says.\n\nAlready, she is counting the cost. Twenty-four hours after her family escaped the fire, she looked on Zillow. The website had valued her home at $3.7mn, now it had revised this to $3mn. Her insurer, has been exemplary, she says. But she can\u2019t see the $1mn they are offering covering the cost of the reconstruction, or the $700,000 covering the personal possessions the family have lost.\n\nDespite all this, she plans to rebuild her home next to the park, a location that\u2019s one of the city\u2019s most vulnerable to future wildfire. If she does leave LA, it will be because of concerns over social deterioration and fear of crime (changes she links to the pandemic), not because of the risk of more fires or an earthquake. And her favoured place to relocate to is Hawaii, where the last significant storm led to a major disaster declared in 2022.\n\nBash does not speak for every Angelino. But this seeming tolerance for future risk is a common feature of those who live in dangerous beautiful places, and humans more generally, according to Justin Angle, joint author of This Is Wildfire: How to Protect Yourself, Your Home, and Your Community in the Age of Heat.\n\nA former bond trader, he compares our discounting of natural disaster risk to investors during asset bubbles, so preoccupied with gorging on present rewards, they ignore the possibility the feast could come to an end. \u201cWe have acclimated to the ease of not having to deal with the problem, so we don\u2019t internalise how likely it is. It\u2019s a failure of imagination. We\u2019re just really bad at understanding these slow-moving risks,\u201d he says.\n\nAngle\u2019s own case illustrates the tension.\n\nHis detached home on the edge of Missoula, a Montana mountain town, abuts a vast swath of forest running 200 miles to the Canadian border and beyond. Dotted with large cotton woods and ponderosa pines, a creek flowing through the property makes it popular with wildlife, including mountain lion, bear, deer, wolf and moose; a rich canopy of bushes and shrubs shelters his home from the summer sun.\n\nPrecisely what makes his plot attractive makes it dangerous, he concedes. \u201cThat is all material that can and will burn someday. But the sound of the water and the wildlife makes up a lot of why I chose to live here.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, efforts to nudge each other out of the imaginative deficit that underlies our skewy risk radar are fraught with social hazard, warns Vaillant.\u00a0His own home in Vancouver, Canada, combines with those of his neighbours to make a fire trap. The houses \u2014 around 100 years old and made predominantly of wood \u2014 provide excellent tinder; the roughly 2-metre gaps between them would provide an optimal wind tunnel to fan the flames.\n\nVaillant has fitted a rooftop sprinkler system that should stop nearby embers from igniting his structure for as long as the water supply lasts. But in 26 years, he has not had a single conversation about fire protection with a neighbour.\n\n\u201cWe build bubbles around ourselves. When a disaster occurs, we decide \u2018that happened to them but it won\u2019t happen to me\u2019. It isn\u2019t climate denial, it\u2019s a psychological survival technique,\u201d he says. To breach those bubbles \u2014 to force open another\u2019s imagination to the prospect of losing their most precious possession \u2014 amounts to psychological trespass.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the infando, the unutterable, it\u2019s like talking about cancer, you [thereby] admit to the possibility it could happen,\u201d he says. His job requires he carry with him a sense of the danger he lives among \u2014 he calls it his \u201cmemento mori\u201d. But to force it upon others would be a bridge too far.\n\nNearly four months after he surveyed the wreckage of his home from the motorboat, Robert Sawyer looks up at me on our Zoom call, from the sun-bathed terrace of a kava bar in downtown St Petersburg.\n\nHe wears a T-shirt, a wood-bead necklace and chain around his neck, and a contained smile that fades briefly at the more harrowing details of the ordeal, which he recounts in a measured, even tone.\u00a0He is about to move out of the hotel provided to him by Fema, the US federal disaster response agency, into a static caravan in the drive of his old home. On his lawn, the pile of ruined interiors and furniture is 30ft long, 20ft wide and 10ft high.\n\nThere\u2019s little to celebrate in his financial position. His mistake on his last insurance application left him with $30,000 of contents cover; his real loss will be closer to $130,000. With the street peppered with \u201cfor sale\u201d signs, his home, worth $1mn before the hurricane, would sell for $800,000 today, he estimates. He doubts he\u2019ll get all of the money he has just claimed from his insurer for renovations.\n\nBut there have been breaks, too. Three Persian rugs, his most expensive possessions, were due to be returned from the cleaners a few days before the hurricane hit; on a whim, he asked the company to store them until the end of the hurricane season.\u00a0When the floodwaters receded and he rushed to strip his interiors before mould set in, 20 friends and neighbours worked full days to help. \u201cWithin a week of the disaster, the insurer cut me a check for $25,000,\u201d he says. \u201cIt kept things moving.\u201d\n\nHe plans to spend upwards of $200,000 of his savings on a renovation of the house, using concrete stilts to elevate the living space clear of the minimum height required by Fema to skip obligatory flood insurance. Even in the most extreme storms, his home should hold more of its value.\n\nWith a bit of luck, a room or two will be inhabitable by June, before the hurricane season starts in earnest. \u201cI\u2019ll hang some tapestries on the side of the wall and call it glamping,\u201d he says, chuckling. \u201cAs far as being worried about putting myself in a similar situation, I don\u2019t really think too much about that \u2014 it\u2019s the cost of living in paradise and a lot of people had it a lot worse than me. In life every day you get up in the morning, take your chances and there\u2019s all kinds of things that could go wrong and no guarantees, and that makes things more interesting\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[The rebuild] will be another part of the adventure of life\u201d.\n\nNothing can change his address, though. By 2050, St Petersburg will be underwater 42 days per year, according to Nasa. For now, it is a human victory, but nature will win in the end.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow House & Home on Instagram", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4697b647-6524-4e4a-aef7-50c1bda21ab3"}, {"uuid4": "d4e0ff5a-8dcb-4980-ba92-754cfaa624f7", "title": "What\u2019s behind financiers\u2019 \u2018blind spot\u2019 on coal", "description": "Institutions have been unwilling to commit to firm policies on metallurgical coal", "author": "Simon Mundy", "published_date": "2025-01-24T12:00:50.088Z", "content": "Welcome back. The conservative campaign against corporate diversity, equity and inclusion policies has been on a roll recently, with US companies from Walmart to McDonald\u2019s to Ford all retreating from pledges and programmes aimed at making their business more socially inclusive. But yesterday, the anti-DEI drive received a noteworthy setback.\n\nAt its annual meeting, Costco faced a shareholder proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think-tank, arguing that the retailer\u2019s DEI policies exposed it to legal and financial risks, and demanding a formal review.\n\nThe board resisted the demand, telling shareholders that the policies would \u201cattract and retain employees who will help our business succeed\u201d. Investors agreed: over 98 per cent of shares were voted against the NCPPR proposal. If companies stand up for their diversity policies, it seems, they may get more investor support than they realise.\n\nMeanwhile, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Donald Trump appeared by video link to take questions from a panel that included the chief executives of Blackstone, TotalEnergies and Santander. Trump took the chance to upbraid Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan for supposedly not doing business with conservatives, while emphasising his destruction of Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cGreen New Scam\u201d, and determination to exploit US fossil fuel reserves.\n\n\u201cNothing can destroy coal \u2014 not the weather, not a bomb \u2014 nothing,\u201d Trump said. But financial companies exposed to the coal sector face some important long-term questions, as we explore in today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nFor financiers seeking to reduce their portfolio carbon emissions, cutting exposure to thermal coal \u2014 used mainly for power generation \u2014 has been a popular choice. Far fewer have moved to cut their financing of metallurgical coal used in steelmaking \u2014 even though it packs a bigger carbon punch.\n\nWhile financial institutions are now coming under pressure from environmental groups to correct this odd imbalance, it reflects a wider problem \u2014 underscoring the need for expanded investment in green technology that will reduce steelmakers\u2019 reliance on the black stuff.\n\nYesterday, the Berlin-based non-profit group Urgewald published a new data set that sheds light on the expansion of metallurgical coal mines all over the world. It features 160 companies that are expanding 252 \u201cmet coal\u201d projects in 18 countries, with growth plans that would increase global production of the commodity by 50 per cent.\n\nMetallurgical coal is turned into coke and burnt with iron ore in blast furnaces, in an integral part of the conventional steelmaking process, which \u2014 despite the widespread adoption of coal-free electric arc furnaces \u2014 still accounts for the bulk of global production of the metal.\n\nBecause of its typically larger methane content, and generally higher emissions from its extraction, metallurgical coal accounts for nearly triple the carbon emissions of thermal coal on a tonne-for-tonne basis, according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie. This is the main reason why the steel sector accounts for roughly 11 per cent of global carbon emissions.\n\nAmong the companies with the biggest met coal expansion plans is BHP Mitsubishi Alliance, jointly owned by Australian mining company BHP and Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi. For BHP, this presents a stark contrast with its plans for a managed exit from its thermal coal business. Similarly, London-listed Glencore has been doubling down on met coal \u2014 notably through last year\u2019s $6.9bn acquisition of a majority stake in Elk Valley Resources \u2014 even as it pursues what it calls a \u201cresponsible decline strategy\u201d for thermal coal.\n\nBy way of explanation, Glencore says that it expects steelmakers\u2019 demand for coal to decline more slowly than demand from power plants. It is far from alone in that belief. In a major report on the coal sector last month, the International Energy Agency noted that investors appeared much more willing to finance new met coal projects than thermal coal mines, in part because public \u201cresistance to met coal investment is somewhat less pronounced\u201d.\n\nThis is certainly reflected in financial companies\u2019 public policies on coal. Of 386 major financial institutions tracked by Paris-based non-profit Reclaim Finance, 183 (mostly European) have announced policies restricting their financing of thermal coal. Only 16 have done the same for the metallurgical variety: 11 banks including Lloyds and ING; four asset managers including Nordea; and insurer Zurich.\n\nUrgewald argues that financiers\u2019 failure to turn their backs on metallurgical coal amounts to a \u201cblind spot\u201d in their policies. Yet, it reflects the fact that the world \u2014 and especially Europe, which accounts for most of the financial institutions with strong climate-related exclusion policies \u2014 has done a far better job of shedding its reliance on coal for electricity than it has for steelmaking.\n\nIn the EU, coal accounted for less than 10 per cent of electricity generation last year, after a strong rise in generation from increasingly cheap renewables over the past decade. More than half of the EU\u2019s steel, in contrast, was made using coal-guzzling blast furnaces. In part, that reflects the EU\u2019s gentle treatment of the steel sector under its carbon pricing system, which has imposed far lower costs on the industry relative to others.\n\nSo for European banks, cutting support for the fading thermal coal sector is a far easier step than taking the same step for metallurgical coal, which remains central to one of the region\u2019s most important industries.\n\nBut it is unlikely to retain that central role forever. Technological advances are enabling electric furnaces to produce higher grades of steel from scrap metal, decreasing the need for coal-burning blast furnaces. Many sorts of steel still require the use of \u201cvirgin iron\u201d derived from iron ore rather than scrap. But well-funded start-ups like Sweden\u2019s Stegra and Boston Metal of the US are developing new approaches to treating iron ore without coal, using hydrogen or electrolysis.\n\nIf European financial institutions were to tighten their met coal policies to match their thermal coal ones, it\u2019s unclear how much short-term impact this would have on miners\u2019 cost of capital. US institutions hardly look likely to take a corresponding move in the near future. The majority of expanding met coal companies profiled by Urgewald are in China, Russia, India and Indonesia, with limited reliance on European financing.\n\nStill, there are sound reasons to reconsider long-term financial exposure to the met coal sector. Even as producers race to increase output, the IEA predicts that demand for the commodity will decline over the next three years, as steel demand in China suffers from its chronic property market malaise. The industry\u2019s gradual evolution towards coal-free alternatives is set to continue and perhaps accelerate with steeper carbon pricing \u2014 notably through the EU\u2019s phasing out of free carbon permits for European steelmakers, and the carbon border tariff it will impose on steel imports.\n\nA crucial factor in the pace of this transition will be the amount of finance that companies are able to raise to develop and deploy green steelmaking technologies \u2014 pushing them down the cost curve, and destroying the economic logic for coal-based steel production.\n\nThe calls for western banks to commit to restricting funding for metallurgical coal are understandable. But they will probably have more impact by focusing on increasing their financing of those low-carbon alternatives.\n\nFuture foods Australia\u2019s vulnerability to climate change has helped make it a test bed for farming innovation, from experimental fungi to \u2018robotic bees\u2019.\n\nEyeing the exit President Javier Milei of Argentina is considering a proposal for the country to leave the Paris agreement on climate change.\n\nTough times BP\u2019s financial travails reflect its years of wishful thinking on fossil fuels, writes John Gapper.", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/810ef183-8e87-47b7-b681-094da58657fa"}, {"uuid4": "927cb9b6-ea5b-49d7-8fff-0d96365861ee", "title": "Five ways to fix the knowledge crisis in the age of Trump", "description": "Elites must not be complacent about a widening epistemological gulf which threatens democracy", "author": "Gillian Tett", "published_date": "2025-01-24T11:19:37.698Z", "content": "A couple of days ago, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, I heard a flock of global luminaries parsing this week\u2019s inauguration of Donald Trump.

More specifically, different social tribes are now interpreting knowledge in such different ways that he fears \u201cdemocracy is being undermined\u201d.\n\nQuite so. Never mind that Trump has haunted Davos this week with his deliberately provocative hyperbole that \u201cweaves fact, fiction and fantasy\u201d together, as Graham Allison, a Harvard professor, told me.\n\nWhat is more notable are the findings of two recent surveys. One, conducted by the WEF, shows that for the second year in a row the meeting\u2019s (mostly) elite delegates consider \u201cdisinformation\u201d the biggest short-term global threat, above war and weather disasters. The issue did not even feature on the worry list before 2024.\n\nThe second poll, from the Edelman public relations group, shows that 61 per cent of people (in 28 countries) feel grievance towards governments, business and the wealthy \u2014 and 40 per cent support hostile action to force change.\n\nMoreover, two-thirds think that business leaders, governments and the media deliberately lie to them, a sharp increase from recent years. The fact that Trump is lashing out at elites and experts \u2014 including scientists at the National Institutes of Health \u2014 reflects this. As one pro-Trump CEO told me after the US president delivered a bombastic address to WEF: \u201cpeople are angry.\u201d\n\nSo how should elites and experts respond? Judging from the Davos chatter, two responses predominate. Some business leaders (such as those in tech) are simply ignoring Trump\u2019s \u201cfictions\u201d to cut deals. Others (like outraged progressives) are dismissing him and his supporters as deluded, stupid or evil \u2014 and wishing that Trump would disappear and/or regulators and Big Tech would \u201ccorrect\u201d lies.\n\nHowever, I would suggest there is another route: leaders should ponder what they themselves can do to help heal this epistemological divide. How? There are several possible steps. The first is to engage in \u201cdeep listening\u201d, to cite the concept championed by the journalist Emily Kasriel. That means hearing what Trump\u2019s supporters are saying with as few preconceived filters as possible. We need empathy to understand why public grievance has exploded.\n\nWe also need this to grasp another point: many of Trump\u2019s supporters believe that they are in a battle to save western civilisation \u2014 and with the same emotional intensity as, say, climate activists. That can\u2019t be dismissed or scorned.\n\nSecond, if leaders want to restore public respect for expertise they must embrace the \u201cerror bar\u201d, the long-standing scientific principle that researchers should honestly indicate their level of confidence in research results. This was forgotten during the pandemic, when politicians made dogmatic statements about medical issues (vaccines, for instance) \u2014 and sometimes curbed debate \u2014 even when the science was provisional.\n\nThat was understandable, perhaps, amid the panic. But it has contributed to public cynicism about \u201cexperts\u201d, as the entrepreneur Peter Thiel recently noted in the FT. So leaders of all political stripes must embrace the error bar in future if they want to restore credibility.\n\nThird, leaders must (as I have often written before) acknowledge that vertical trust \u2014 in authority figures and institutions \u2014 is collapsing today. Instead, people are increasingly relying on peer groups or local communities as sources of advice (in other words, on lateral trust relations). Leaders might hate this, but they must work with it \u2014 not wish it away.\n\nFourth, if you believe in the enlightenment principle of critical reasoning, you must put your money behind that. That means paying for quality journalism, backing intellectual inquiry at think-tanks and universities and promoting this in policymaking. For inspiration, look at 314action.org, a political action committee created by American scientists which aims to put more scientists into public office. It has already rallied thousands of volunteers. But far more could be done.\n\nFifth, leaders should champion initiatives to counter online misinformation. That does not mean using hierarchical power to crush free speech. But it does mean installing guardrails against violent activism and supporting community fact-checking platforms. These crowd-focused tools are now the main recourse against online lies, since Meta and others have decided to cut content moderation.\n\nThese steps are not a magic wand. But they are better than appeasement, despair and blame. The hard truth is that neither Big Tech nor government can or will fix the epistemological crisis. The responsibility sits with us all.\n\ngillian.tett@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b4de95a2-c0da-4de8-8ad4-097f0d045633"}, {"uuid4": "3c49be6b-d36c-425a-9f35-25814909346c", "title": "Wall Street will stymie Donald Trump\u2019s US oil surge plan, say shale bosses", "description": "Output set to rise more slowly under new president than during Joe Biden\u2019s term", "author": "Amanda Chu", "published_date": "2025-01-24T05:01:56.185Z", "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s call for a new oil boom will be thwarted by Wall Street\u2019s reluctance to approve another drilling binge, shale bosses\u00a0have warned.\n\nTotal US oil output in Trump\u2019s second term will rise by less than 1.3mn barrels a day, said Rystad Energy and Wood Mackenzie, well below the 1.9mn b/d rise achieved under Joe Biden and much less than in the shale bonanza years in the previous decade.\n\nExecutives said investor pressure on companies and the economic realities of a sector always beholden to oil prices would be obstacles to Trump\u2019s quest to launch an era of \u201cAmerican energy dominance\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe incentive, if you will, to just drill, baby, drill\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.

He has also moved to eliminate Biden-era regulations that drillers say increased their costs and restricted activity.\n\nBut executives warned that even Trump\u2019s full-throated support for fossil fuels and deregulation could have limited impact.\n\n\u201cAs much as the incoming administration is very favourable around energy and power\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we don\u2019t see a significant change in activity levels going forward,\u201d said David Schorlemer, chief financial officer of ProPetro, an oilfield services company in the Permian.\n\nProducers\u2019 reluctance comes after two decades of soaring growth \u2014 and sometimes punishing oil price volatility.\n\nUS oil and gas production exploded in the past 15 years as drillers found ways to unlock vast deposits locked in shale rocks. Wall Street funded a headlong drilling race that made the US the world\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer.\n\nBut brutal price crashes in 2014 and 2020 triggered widespread bankruptcies, a more cautious approach from investors and a change in producers\u2019 behaviour \u2014 especially in the face of softer crude prices.\n\nA recent Kansas City Federal Reserve survey found that the average US oil price needed for a substantial increase in drilling was $84 a barrel, versus about $74 a barrel today.\n\nJPMorgan predicts that US oil prices will drift down to $64 a barrel by the end of this year and shale activity will \u201cslow to a crawl\u201d in 2026.\n\n\u201cIf prices are anaemic, you can remove all the red tape you want.

They work wonders on industries previously fettered by regulation. But there is little evidence that this has been the case for US fossil fuels. That suggests President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to expedite oil and gas projects will deliver a trickle, not a flood.\n\nOil producers have been \u201cdrill, baby, drilling\u201d for quite some time. In 2024, US oil production averaged 13.2mn barrels a day, making it the largest oil producer in the world. That\u2019s two-and-a-half times what the country was producing in 2008. The supply of US gas, too, has roughly doubled during that period.\n\nTrue, this breakneck pace cannot continue forever. The industry will add an extra 270,000 barrels a day on average in 2025 and 2026, according to consultancy Argus Media, roughly a quarter of what it squeezed out in 2023. But that largely reflects the fact that a lot of the best acreage has already been exploited.\n\nTrumpian policies, like encouraging drilling in US coastal waters, will open up new territories. Even if they contain exploitable resources, though, the time it takes to develop a project extends beyond the length of a single four-year presidential term. This is no short-term fix.\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, what inhibits the flow of oil is not red tape, but low prices. Producing oil from US shale formations is relatively expensive. Companies need prices to be somewhere between $60 and $80 a barrel if they want to cover all their costs and pay dividends, estimates Christopher Wheaton at Stifel.\n\nShale is also highly sensitive to commodity price moves because, unlike traditional projects in which much of the cost is sunk upfront, maintaining shale output requires constant spending. By way of example, the record low price for US natural gas in 2024 has already caused production to nudge lower.\n\nThat rather limits Trump\u2019s room for manoeuvre, at least with oil. Gas may be a bit more responsive, given there is some hope that strong demand, not least from data centres, and the resumption of LNG export permitting might raise domestic prices. That would help producers justify more supply.\n\nAs it stands, the oil market is hardly undersupplied. A spluttering China translates into weak demand. Opec+, which wants to see prices stay high, is sufficiently worried that it is actively holding back supply. That means that any increase in US oil production is likely to push down prices and thus be shortlived. The only thing gushing in the oil patch is rhetoric.\n\ncamilla.palladino@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/389a05c0-dd8a-4645-820e-9e6741359144"}, {"uuid4": "2882fbe1-fb53-4bf8-a6b6-d61b12f9a8f1", "title": "US adds Tencent and CATL to blacklist of companies working with China\u2019s military", "description": "Shares of WeChat owner and EV battery maker fall after defence department discloses designation", "author": "Steff Ch\u00e1vez", "published_date": "2025-01-07T07:39:42.082Z", "content": "Tech group Tencent and the world\u2019s dominant battery maker CATL are among a swath of Chinese companies that have been designated by the Pentagon as having alleged military links, in a move that sent the industry giants\u2019 shares tumbling.\n\nTencent\u2019s US-listed shares closed down 7.8 per cent following the news and were down the same amount in Hong Kong trading on Tuesday.

All projections about the coming year assume Trump will dictate global economic and market trends.\n\nA single factor is never a solid foundation for forecasting. The world is not unipolar and does not revolve around one personality, not even one as big as Trump\u2019s. Historically, the impact of US presidents on markets has often been surprising, and at times minimal.\n\nInvestors were braced for a negative shock when Trump came to power in 2017, but that year turned out to be one of the least volatile for US stocks ever. Trump constantly threatened to undermine China with tariffs and yet, during his first term, the best-performing major market in the world was China, outpacing even the US.\n\nIf past is prelude, Trump 2.0 will not play out as most investors expect. Ironically, continuing faith in \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d assumes that under Trump the world will see more of the same trends it saw under Joe Biden: US dominance of the global economy and markets, led by its big-cap tech businesses. But those trends are already very extended and vulnerable to forces larger than the US president-elect. For a variety of reasons, competitive churn could return to global markets in 2025 and lead to seismic shifts.\n\nHistory shows that the global economy and markets move in cycles, not straight trend lines. Contrarian investing is rooted in these patterns. The hot investment theme of one decade typically gets overcrowded, sowing the seeds of its own demise, and does not stay hot the next. But here we are halfway through the 2020s, and the hot bet of the 2010s \u2014 big US tech \u2014 is still paying off.\n\nIn the past, the list of global top 10 companies by market cap has changed dramatically with each new decade. Now seven of the 10 are holdovers from the 2010s, including Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. The trends of the past 15 years are stretched thin amid the growing manias for America and AI, which are supercharged by excessive US stimulus, the gamification of investing and the rise of algorithmic trading and passive money managers.\n\nCreative destruction has been a defining and indeed necessary feature of capitalism since its roots in the 18th century; either it\u2019s dead, or dormant and poised for a comeback. My bet is on the comeback. That would herald a (belated) return for contrarian investing, starting with a shift away from the US and its top tech companies.\n\nMomentum traders are the polar opposite of contrarians, believing that winners and losers of recent months will continue on the same paths in coming months. Last year was a great one for this class: momentum mania swept beyond big US tech to lift stocks in the financial and other sectors as well.\n\nA turning point looms. Since the 1950s, according to Empirical Research Partners, stocks that lead the market for nine months outperform over the next 12 months by 3 per cent on average. Rarely have they outperformed by more than 20 per cent, as they did in 2024. And after a run that strong, momentum stocks underperform by nearly 10 per cent over the next 12 months on average.\n\nMomentum runs tend to reinforce the assumption that good times will roll, pulling in retail investors in the late stages. That\u2019s happening now. American consumers have not been more bullish on US stocks since surveys began tracking this sentiment. Momentum investing looks poised to crash in a way that could hit many investors hard.\n\nUnder Trump, cuts in taxes and regulations will send the US economy and market to new heights, or so the conventional wisdom goes. Though the pandemic is over, and jobs have recovered, the US deficit is still strikingly high at around 6 per cent of GDP. In fact, adjusted for the low unemployment rate, the US deficit is five times the previous record high for a post-second world war recovery. And Trump\u2019s agenda threatens to push it from extreme to even more so.\n\nThe bulls wave off warnings that fiscal recklessness will trigger a crisis, since no obvious calamity has come despite decades of similar warnings. They overlook the fact that, compared with other developed nations, America\u2019s government debt has increased more than two times faster as a share of GDP in this decade and its interest payments on that debt are now three times higher.\n\nGiven the amount of new longer-dated US Treasury bonds set to hit the markets in the coming months, 2025 could see the moment when bond vigilantes take notice. In recent years, traders have punished profligate governments from Brazil to the UK and \u2014 albeit less aggressively \u2014 France. Many observers assume that the US, as the premier economic power, is invulnerable to such attacks, but its increasingly precarious finances could shatter that assumption soon.\n\nBuzz about \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d overlooks the artificial boost the US is getting from state support. Following the pandemic, government spending rose sharply as a share of GDP. More than 20 per cent of new US jobs are now created by government, up from 1 per cent in the 2010s. Public transfers including Social Security account for more than a quarter of residents\u2019 income in more than 50 per cent of US counties \u2014 up from just 10 per cent in 2000.\n\nThe overstimulated US economy is growing at a pace near 3 per cent, but the fiscal stimulus is set to diminish in 2025 and so is the pace of monetary easing. If the new administration tries to further stimulate the economy, an already elevated inflation rate could surge, forcing the Fed and the bond market to raise interest rates.\n\nIn turn, bond market pressure would finally compel spending restraint, hurting economic growth and corporate profits, at least for a while. Interestingly, expectations for US growth are now so bullish, economists see only a 20 per cent probability of recession, down from near 70 per cent a year ago. While there is no visible catalyst for a recession, fading stimulus effects suggest the US economy is likely to slow in 2025 to a rate closer to its long-term potential of about 2 per cent, if not lower. America will look much less exceptional then.\n\nMany countries now languish in the shadows \u2014 but that is where the next stars are usually found. Recall that a decade ago, investors dismissed much of southern Europe as hopeless, until crisis forced them to reform. The nations formerly dismissed as \u201cPigs\u201d now include some of the continent\u2019s bright spots, led by Portugal, Greece and Spain. The dark spots \u2014 Germany and France \u2014 could also find themselves unexpectedly compelled by their weak economies to change for the better.\n\nToday, global investors ignore most of the developing world. Among the large developing economies, fewer than one in two saw faster per capita GDP growth than the US in the last five years. In coming years, however, that share is expected to rise to more than four out of five, with big boosts coming from investment in plants and equipment, and resilient consumer spending.\n\nDisciplined government spending helps explain why credit rating agencies are now more sanguine on developing nations, with upgrades outnumbering downgrades by margins not seen in years, including positive turns on recent basket cases like Argentina and Turkey.\n\nFor the most part, global investors have yet to react, but locals have. Domestic equity cultures are propping up markets from Saudi Arabia to South Africa. India is already something of a unicorn \u2014 as the one global market star outside the US \u2014 but it may not be so unusual by the end of 2025.\n\nThe bear case is hard to argue against. No country with a shrinking population and a heavy burden of debt has ever been able to grow at even half Beijing\u2019s target rate of 5 per cent. Still, any contrarian has to be curious about a market most global investors now dismiss as \u201cuninvestable\u201d, even though it is the world\u2019s second largest.\n\nDiamonds can be found in this rough, for example by looking for profitable publicly traded companies with high cash flows. There are now about 250 companies in China with a market cap more than $1bn and a free cash flow yield above 10 per cent \u2014 roughly 100 more than in the US, and 60 more than in Europe. Yet sentiment is as bearish on China as it is bullish on America.\n\nCompare their leading electric car companies, BYD and Tesla. Both generate similar revenues and offer a similar return on equity, but sales volume is growing twice as fast at BYD, which is rapidly expanding its share of the global market. Yet BYD stock sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of\u00a015,\u00a0compared with around\u00a0120\u00a0for Tesla. Its market cap is\u00a0just over\u00a0$100bn, Tesla\u2019s is\u00a0more than $1.2tn. In the coming year, investors may come to see China as investable again, at least in its profitable parts.\n\nBig Tech\u2019s supernormal profits and massive cash flows have been a significant draw for investors. But that advantage is shrinking fast. Taken together, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Meta and Tesla are on pace to invest nearly $280bn in artificial intelligence this year, up from $80bn five years ago. The race to dominate AI is on, and as a result, free cash flow growth for the biggest tech companies recently turned negative.\n\nAI mania may be getting ahead of itself. Fewer than one in 20 workers say they use AI daily. Fewer than one in 10 US companies have incorporated AI into their operations. That does not mean they won\u2019t, just that it is far from clear how this technology will be applied \u2014 much less how strictly it will be regulated or which mega firms will make money on it. Remember, few if any established firms emerged as big winners of the internet or shale oil revolutions.\n\nThough it is tough to imagine what could derail Big Tech firms, one answer is overspending on data centres and other AI infrastructure. One of the biggest capital spending booms that America has seen since the second world war may be great for the consumer, but could be the straw that finally breaks the supernormal profits of Big Tech companies and inspires investors to question their lofty valuations.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s tariff threats are a negotiating tactic, as his aides say, they are already working to bring other countries to the table \u2014 but without the US. After 25 years of talks, last month representatives of 31 nations agreed on plans for the world\u2019s largest trade union, linking the EU with the Mercosur group in Latin America. If ratified, it would cut tariffs by 90 per cent among member states, which account for 25 per cent of global GDP.\n\nSpooked by America\u2019s use of sanctions to cut off rivals from the dollar-based international finance system, many countries are making deals to promote trade with regional neighbours, or without the dollar. India has agreements with 22 countries to conduct trade in rupees; 90 per cent of India-Russia trade is transacted in local currencies. Petro states including Saudi Arabia have cut deals to sell their oil in currencies other than the dollar as well.\n\nIn recent years global trade has shifted, and today its biggest channels are within the developing world. Eight of the 10 fastest-growing trade corridors do not include the US, but many of them do have one terminus in China. The more the US threatens tariffs and weaponises the dollar, the harder its erstwhile partners will work to promote trade without America.\n\nAs a haven for investors fleeing from regulators, the booming private markets for equity and credit are no longer just a niche alternative. Since 2000, the number of public US companies has fallen by nearly half to about 4,000, while the number of private ones nearly quintupled to about 10,000.\n\nPrivate markets are becoming the first choice for companies trying to raise money. Private lending is growing at twice the pace of bank lending. The volume of capital raised in private markets recently surpassed the volume in public markets worldwide.\n\nMeanwhile, the often-opaque risks are growing. The falling quality of some private credit issuers is showing up in high default rates for their leveraged loans. Others are repackaging certain products for sale in ways that \u201ctest the limits\u201d of risk safeguards. A few big firms are considering plans to offer private credit in exchange traded funds open to daily public trading \u2014 as if the general public were equipped to weigh the risk of assets that need to report results once a quarter, if at all. The mainstreaming of private markets and the resulting excesses could come under greater scrutiny in 2025.\n\nAmericans are exceptional in another way, with an adult obesity rate that at 44 per cent is the highest in the developed world. So it is no surprise that American TV is full of ads for the relatively new class of \u201cGLP-1\u201d weight-loss drugs, suggesting they offer a bright and easy path to weight loss.\n\nLast month came a new study detecting a tiny dip in the US obesity rate. Its authors suggested this unexpected turn may be explained in good part by GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic, which is likely to generate even more buzz around these wildly popular weight-loss remedies.\n\nHowever, in the growing body of GLP-1 research, not all the news is so sunny. Once people stop the injections, many of the pounds come back. In suppressing appetite, these treatments can also destroy muscle, paralyse the stomach and impair vision. Rapid fat loss can leave sagging skin in embarrassingly visible places, which is why internet searches for \u201cOzempic butt\u201d and \u201cOzempic legs\u201d are mounting steadily.\n\nNo doubt, these drugs have some useful benefits, and contrarians are not doctors. They do, however, know that what sounds too good to be true probably is. And as a quick fix for obesity, this could turn out to be just another diet fad.", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ff169e88-c415-400f-8a58-5ebdd5d2a643"}, {"uuid4": "09700d36-6f89-46e8-a17d-f6b6738adfb8", "title": "Chinese venture capitalists force failed founders on to debtor blacklist", "description": "Pursuit of entrepreneurs threatens start-up ecosystem as investors target personal assets to claw back funding", "author": "Ryan McMorrow", "published_date": "2025-01-06T05:00:06.823Z", "content": "Chinese venture capitalists are hounding failed founders, pursuing personal assets and adding the individuals to a national debtor blacklist when they fail to pay up, in moves that are throwing the country\u2019s start-up funding ecosystem into crisis.\n\nThe hard-nosed tactics by risk capital providers have been facilitated by clauses known as redemption rights, included in nearly all the financing deals struck during China\u2019s boom times.\n\n\u201cMy investors verbally promised they wouldn\u2019t enforce them, that they had never enforced them before \u2014 and in \u201917 and \u201918 that was true \u2014 no one was enforcing them,\u201d said Neuroo Education founder Wang Ronghui, who now owes investors millions of dollars after her childcare chain stumbled during the pandemic.\n\nWhile they are relatively rare in US venture investing, more than 80 per cent of venture and private equity deals in China contain redemption provisions, according to Shanghai-based law firm Lifeng Partners estimates.\n\nThey typically require companies, and often their founders as well, to buy back investors\u2019 shares plus interest if certain targets such as an initial public offering timeline, valuation goals or revenue metrics are not met.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s causing huge harm to the venture ecosystem because if a start-up fails, the founder is essentially facing asset seizures and spending restrictions,\u201d said a Hangzhou-based lawyer who has represented several indebted entrepreneurs and asked not to be named. \u201cThey can never recover.\u201d\n\nLifeng, in its recent report on redemption rights, said they had turned entrepreneurship into a \u201cgame of unlimited liability\u201d. In 90 per cent of investor lawsuits, the firm said, founders were named as defendants alongside companies, with 10 per cent of the individuals ultimately added to China\u2019s debtor blacklist.\n\nOnce blacklisted, it is nearly impossible for individuals to start another business. They are also blocked from a range of economic activities, such as taking planes or high-speed trains, staying in hotels or leaving China. The country lacks a personal bankruptcy law, making it extremely difficult for most to escape the debts.\n\nWith Chinese funds and VC firms now struggling to return capital to their outside investors, a growing number have turned to redemption clauses to recoup as much money as possible. Lifeng estimates that 20 per cent of all investor exits in 2021 and 2022 came from companies repurchasing their investors\u2019 shares and that more than 10,000 VC or private equity-backed Chinese groups face redemption issues.\n\nA start-up adviser who did not wish to be named said the situation was perversely incentivising VCs to pursue portfolio companies that were doing well but lacked an immediate path to a sale or an IPO.\n\n\u201cVCs are putting pressure on the start-ups that can pay,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not venture \u2014 it\u2019s debt.\u201d\n\nThe number of entrepreneurs caught up by the legal actions continues to grow. They include Wang Ziru, who a decade ago grabbed attention as a brash young founder and raised tens of millions of renminbi for his tech media and review platform Zealer.\n\nBy 2021, with traffic waning, Wang left for an executive role at home appliance giant Gree. Then, on August 9 last year, a Shenzhen court imposed spending restrictions on Wang for failing to pay a Zealer investor Rmb34mn ($4.7mn). The amount that had snowballed with interest from the VC\u2019s initial Rmb19mn equity investment, according to a lawyer briefed on the case.\u00a0Wang lost his job a few days later.\n\nThe founder is contesting the judgment and said on social media he was not notified of the lawsuit and that the deal\u2019s redemption provision was not triggered.\n\nOne of China\u2019s most famous entrepreneurs, Luo Yonghao, turned his struggle to repay debts from his failed smartphone start-up Smartisan into a spectacle, eventually hawking enough iPhones and office chairs in online video livestreams to pay off suppliers and remove his name from the debtor blacklist in 2020.\n\nThen some of Smartisan\u2019s investors demanded Luo pay hundreds of millions more in renminbi to buy back their shares.\n\n\u201cInvestment is not a loan,\u201d Luo wrote on the social media platform Weibo in August last year. \u201cWhen a venture capital deal fails, one must accept the outcome. Those who resort to underhanded tactics against entrepreneurs because they can\u2019t bear the result are, without a doubt, unscrupulous capitalists.\u201d\n\nThe cases have filled Chinese courts. Records show Xu Mingqi lost his company and all of his other identifiable assets to investors after his materials group Yeagood failed to meet a promised three-year window for an IPO.\n\nChina\u2019s supreme court in 2021 ruled that since his wife Zheng Shaoai had also worked at Yeagood, one investor could seize communal property including the apartment held in her name.\n\nWang, the 47-year-old childcare chain founder, has even had funds in her health insurance account seized by investors. She said her problems began in 2021, when funds connected to state-backed investor Guangdong Cultural Investment Management demanded their Rmb16mn of shares be repurchased with interest because her start-up had failed to attain a Rmb500mn valuation.\n\nTheir lawsuit torpedoed a funding round needed to offset pandemic-related closures of the group\u2019s 36 day care centres, she said. Now, Wang owes about Rmb30mn to the GCIM-affiliated funds, Rmb11mn to banks and potentially more to other investors whose redemption clauses have yet to be triggered.\n\nGCIM did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cI built my company into an industry leader \u2014 I have ability and I have drive \u2014 but every path I try to take is a dead end,\u201d said Wang. \u201cAn unexpected turn of events has left me permanently and utterly trapped.\u201d", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/38f1e51b-83b8-45cb-9cbf-2bc63f18e6ce"}, {"uuid4": "8b044aa4-5b72-4b26-85cc-0f8314d56dbb", "title": "China\u2019s drive to give Taiwanese visitors local IDs alarms Taipei", "description": "Officials fear jurisdiction will be compromised and push could open door for Beijing to intervene in its domestic affairs ", "author": "Kathrin Hille", "published_date": "2025-01-06T01:14:59.588Z", "content": "China is signing growing numbers of Taiwanese people up for local resident or even identity cards, in a drive to incorporate them into its society that is setting off alarm bells in Taipei.\n\nTaiwan government officials said Beijing had become \u201cfocused\u201d on getting visiting Taiwanese to apply for Chinese resident cards, bank accounts and local mobile phone numbers \u2014 known as the \u201cthree documents\u201d \u2014 with many then being given the local identity cards, which are reserved for citizens.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that when more and more Taiwanese have Chinese citizenship, it will compromise our jurisdiction,\u201d said a senior China policy official in Taipei. \u201cIf a Taiwanese with a Chinese ID was involved in an incident here, China could say they need to take care of the issue because the person is their citizen and intervene in our domestic affairs.\u201d\n\nThe push is seen as particularly concerning as China is steadily expanding a multi-faceted pressure campaign against Taiwan. Beijing claims the island as part of its territory and threatens to take it by force if Taipei resists unification indefinitely.\n\nSimilar tactics of giving local status to citizens from neighbouring countries has long been part of Russia\u2019s playbook. Moscow issued passports to eastern Ukrainians who moved to Russia after it helped to orchestrate conflict in the region in 2014. Russia also gave citizenship to residents of two breakaway regions of Georgia and then cited the need to protect them as a pretext for a brief 2008 war.\n\nTaiwanese officials said China\u2019s push to give more Taiwanese local papers had not reached that level yet, but it posed a risk of the same nature.\n\nThe issue surfaced when a Taiwanese video blogger\u2019s documentary in late December suggested hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese had Chinese identity papers. Lin Chin-cheng, a Taiwanese who heads a Chinese government-backed start-up centre for youth entrepreneurs from Taiwan in the Chinese city of Quanzhou, claims in the film that about 200,000 Taiwanese hold Chinese IDs.\n\nThat claim could not be confirmed. But government officials, tourists and businesspeople from Taiwan said visitors to China in recent months had been asked to fill in applications for the \u201cthree documents\u201d.\n\nAt China\u2019s centenary celebrations for the Whampoa Military Academy last year, veterans from Taiwan were signed up at special desks, participants said. The Straits Forum, an annual event which is part of the Chinese Communist party\u2019s United Front tactics to engage Taiwanese not openly hostile to it, also featured \u201cthree documents\u201d application desks.\n\nThree Taiwanese people who recently travelled to China on a ferry from Taiwan-controlled Kinmen said arrival procedures in Xiamen now included filling in forms that they only later understood were applications for those documents.\n\nThe resident card for Taiwanese, which is part of the \u201cthree documents\u201d, does not amount to Chinese citizenship \u2014 Beijing presents it as a preferential measure to allow Taiwanese equal access to local services.\n\nBut Taipei fears it is becoming the entry point into citizen status. \u201cThe local ID frequently is the immediate next step, or is even directly offered instead of the resident card,\u201d said a national security official. Taiwan officials added that local IDs were being heavily promoted as an opportunity for better conditions on loans or home sales.\n\nUnder Taiwanese law, citizens who take up a Chinese ID will have their Taiwanese household registration revoked. But Taipei struggles to effectively monitor its citizens\u2019 actions in China as Beijing has cut off almost all official communication with the Taiwanese government, though cross-Strait travel, trade and investment built over decades continue.\n\nAccording to the government\u2019s statistics office, 217,000 Taiwanese worked in China as of 2023 \u2014 only half of the numbers seen at the peak a decade ago, but a 22 per cent increase over the previous year.\n\nTaiwan President Lai Ching-te last week warned the public not to be lured in by the supposed short-term gain of Chinese papers.\n\n\u201cWe have an old saying in Taiwan: Free things turn out very costly. That is very true,\u201d he told reporters after his New Year address. Lai pointed to the many Chinese people taking enormous risks to illegally migrate to other nations, arguing that taking up a Chinese ID at this time was absurd for a citizen of a democratic country and could prove \u201cthe end of your road into the world\u201d.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing did not respond to a request for comment.", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/14e718e0-b5f2-4b80-a34c-18c6b4493d27"}, {"uuid4": "4832af45-6b10-4c2e-942c-c0fbdbcad4bc", "title": "Taiwan asks South Korea for help over Chinese ship after subsea cable damaged", "description": "Shunxing39 cargo vessel is heading for Busan after Taipei suggests anchor-dragging was \u2018sabotage\u2019", "author": "Kathrin Hille", "published_date": "2025-01-05T08:25:15.310Z", "content": "Taiwan has asked South Korea for assistance investigating a Chinese-owned ship suspected of cutting a subsea cable off its northern coast on Friday.\n\nTaiwan telecoms operator Chunghwa Telecom and the Taiwan Coast Guard said on Saturday that the cargo vessel Shunxing39 was believed to have caused damage to a communications cable \u2014 close to the port of Keelung on Taiwan\u2019s north coast \u2014 on the morning of January 3.\n\nIt follows incidents in which Chinese ships came under scrutiny after fibre optic cables in the Baltic Sea were severed last November and a gas pipeline and cable were damaged there in October 2023.\n\nThe latest occurrence also highlighted the vulnerability of crucial offshore communications and energy infrastructure and the difficulties in prosecuting sabotage.\n\nWhile the ship sails under Cameroon\u2019s flag, Taiwan officials said it was owned by Jie Yang Trading Limited. The Hong Kong-registered company\u2019s only listed director is Guo Wenjie, a mainland China citizen.\n\nChunghwa Telecom said data connections were immediately restored by rerouting data to other international subsea cables.\n\nBut Taipei is concerned that China could surreptitiously cut Taiwan\u2019s external communications links in any potential attempt at annexing the country. Beijing claims sovereignty over the island and has threatened to seize it by force if necessary.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nChunghwa Telecom and Taiwan government officials told the Financial Times the damaged cable is part of the Trans-Pacific Express Cable System.\n\nThe subsea internet cable connecting Taiwan with the US west coast is owned by an international consortium. As well as Chunghwa, it includes the US operator AT&T, Japan\u2019s NTT, Korea Telecom and Chinese operators China Telecom and China Unicom.\n\n\u201cSince it was not possible for us to question the captain, we have asked the South Korean authorities to help with the investigation at the ship\u2019s next port of destination,\u201d a Taiwan Coast Guard official said. A Taiwanese national security official said the ship was due to arrive in Busan over the next few days.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s coastguard and other government officials said tracking data from the ship\u2019s automatic identification system signal and satellite data showed that the Shunxing39 had dragged its anchor at the location where the cable was ruptured.\n\nWhile a coastguard ship carried out an external inspection of the vessel and established radio contact with the captain, its officials could not board it due to rough weather, and it could not order its seizure for further investigation under international law because too much time had passed since the incident, officials said.\n\n\u201cThis is another case of a very worrying global trend of sabotage against subsea cables,\u201d said a senior Taiwanese national security official. \u201cThe ships that are involved in these incidents are typically rundown vessels that have little above-the-board business. This one, too, is in very bad shape. It is similar to the ships that are part of Russia\u2019s \u2018shadow fleet.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to data from ship tracking and maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic, the Shunxing39 had been criss-crossing waters close to Taiwan\u2019s north coast since December 1. The pattern suggested the cable damage was not an \u201cinnocent accident\u201d, the official said.\n\nChinese commercial or fishing vessels have occasionally participated in some of the large military exercises Beijing regularly holds close to Taiwan.

The world\u2019s second-largest film market recorded total box office revenues of Rmb42.5bn ($5.8bn) in 2024, down nearly 23 per cent from Rmb54.9bn a year earlier, said the China Film Administration.\n\nThat compares with a 3 per cent year-on-year drop in the North American box office to $8.7bn in 2024, according to Comscore and Deadline.\n\n\u201cA lack of domestic industry supply definitely hurt, but that damage was amplified by a poor economy,\u201d said Chris Fenton, a US-China analyst and adjunct professor at the University of Southern California.\n\nOn a usually busy Christmas Eve, box office revenues in China plunged to Rmb38mn from Rmb170mn in 2023 and were the lowest in at least 13 years, according to Chinese ticketing platform Maoyan.\n\n\u201c[We are] affected by the consumption downgrade,\u201d said Wang, a cinema manager in Beijing.\u2009\u201cSimply put, it\u2019s an economic crisis.\u201d Attendance was estimated to have dropped by up to 35 per cent in 2024 in many major Chinese cities, with a lot of theatres operating at a loss, he said.\n\nInstead of a visit to the cinema, many viewers were opting for online streaming platforms and short-form video content available on their mobile devices, according to industry analysts at Chinese entertainment data provider Beacon Professional.\n\nAnother factor was \u201cnot enough quality domestic films on the market to generate buzz and enthusiasm for people to head out\u201d, said Ying Zhu, author of Hollywood in China: Behind the Scenes of the World\u2019s Largest Movie Market.\n\nBut while streaming services had \u201ccertainly eaten into cinema revenue\u201d, Zhu said China\u2019s box office decline had \u201cmore to do with overall economic stagnation, with the high youth unemployment rate leading to shrinking pocket money for entertainment\u201d.\n\nKenny Ng, a film scholar at Hong Kong Baptist University, said the pandemic still \u201chad a lasting impact on consumer behaviour in China, particularly in the entertainment industry\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe shift towards home entertainment has gained momentum, with many consumers remaining hesitant to return to crowded venues like cinemas,\u201d he said.\n\nSun, a 27-year-old tech worker in Shanghai, said he only went to the cinema twice last year, compared with more than 10 times in previous years, with domestic streaming platforms such as Tencent Video becoming increasingly attractive.\n\n\u201cMany theatrical releases don\u2019t give me a strong urge to watch them in cinemas\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[and] there weren\u2019t many attractive movies released,\u201d he said.\n\nChina\u2019s top-grossing film in 2024 was the domestically produced comedy-drama YOLO, an adaptation of a Japanese film about a woman who lacks confidence and takes up boxing to change her life. YOLO took in Rmb3.4bn, according to Maoyan, lower than the more than Rmb4.5bn generated by the top movie of 2023, the Chinese comedy-mystery Full River Red.\n\nChina has been experiencing weak consumer confidence, with youth unemployment as high as 17 per cent and wage growth slowing, while growing social tensions have also concerned Chinese leaders.\n\n\u201cThe return of comedies, while helping to defuse the social tension, also attests to viewer fatigue towards big-budget propaganda films,\u201d said Zhu, who is also a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film.\n\nThe Chinese market contributed up to 30 per cent of global revenues for Hollywood blockbusters before 2020, according to USC\u2019s Fenton, but their appeal has faded in recent years, with many big movies seeing 10 per cent or less of their totals coming from Chinese box office receipts. Only one Hollywood production \u2014 the sci-fi action franchise Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire \u2014 made the top 10 grossing films in China last year, according to Maoyan.\n\nHollywood films have increasingly \u201cfailed to connect with local audiences\u201d, said Zhu. China\u2019s state news agency Xinhua in an opinion last year noted \u201ca lack of novelty and creativity in Hollywood movies with their formulaic storylines having satiated Chinese audiences\u201d.\n\n\u201cHollywood movies are losing their lustre with China\u2019s Gen Z audiences,\u201d said Shi Chuan, vice chair of the Shanghai Film Association, referring to Western culture\u2019s shrinking influence on the country\u2019s younger generation.\n\nShi cited the lukewarm\u00a0reception for the latest Mission: Impossible as an\u00a0example. \u201cThis is a high-quality movie but it disappointed at the box office, as [many] Chinese Gen Z moviegoers don\u2019t know who Tom Cruise is,\u201d said Shi.\n\nMeanwhile, declining financing, censorship and changing tastes have been blamed by film producers and industry analysts for holding back the domestic industry.\n\nThe box office would probably still continue to grow over the next few years \u201cdue to the enormous size of [China\u2019s] population\u201d, said Fenton. Its film industry is hoping domestic blockbusters, including the fantasy epic Creation of the Gods II: Demonic Confrontation and martial arts fare The Legend of the Condor Heroes: The Great Hero, both set to be released during the peak lunar new year season at the end of January, could revive box office sales.\n\n\u201cAs always, the quality of films is important,\u201d said Stanley Rosen, a University of Southern California professor specialising in Chinese society, adding: \u201cAn improving economy in China would help a lot.\u201d", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e2c04590-cb4f-43cc-85dc-786377fb5cb2"}, {"uuid4": "6e49cb55-874b-4fc8-af84-ad637fd26434", "title": "Xi has a plan for retaliating against Trump\u2019s gamesmanship", "description": "China is marshalling its forces for long-term competition against an America that it believes is divided and in decline", "author": "Evan Medeiros", "published_date": "2025-01-05T02:00:29.439Z", "content": "The writer is a professor at Georgetown University and a senior adviser with The Asia Group. He served on the US National Security Council staff in 2009-2015\n\nIf Donald Trump\u2019s China policy is defined by uncertainty and contradiction, Xi Jinping\u2019s strategy is defined by clarity and determination. The Chinese president\u2019s approach to the US president-elect is not a secret. Beijing has been quite clear since the election about its views and possible responses.\n\nXi plans not only to respond, but to take advantage of Trump\u2019s moves. During Trump\u2019s first term, Beijing scrambled to react. It is determined not to repeat that. Xi is well into his preparations and has signalled as much.\n\nMost Chinese analysts were not surprised by Trump\u2019s election, linking his comeback to a global tide of populism and nationalism. Beijing believes it now understands Trump\u2019s gamesmanship and can manipulate his administration.\u00a0China\u2019s confidence is based on the conclusion \u2014 accurate or not \u2014 that China in 2025 is different from 2017, and so is the US and the world.\n\nMany Chinese argue that Xi is stronger politically and the economy is more self-reliant and resilient, even amid recent challenges. Chinese analysts view the US economy as more fragile and American politics as deeply divided. Geopolitically, Beijing sees US influence as declining throughout the global south and Asia \u2014 and support for China\u2019s vision as rising.\n\nXi has already signalled that he will treat his ties to Trump as a purely business relationship, albeit Don Corleone style. He won\u2019t personally embrace Trump and will retaliate early and hard in order to generate leverage. Beijing in effect rejected Trump\u2019s invitation for Xi to attend the inauguration.\n\nBut Beijing is also signalling it wants dialogue and is open to a deal to avoid new tariffs. However, the Chinese, who prefer to use back channels, are struggling to find the right one to understand what Trump \u201creally\u201d wants.\u00a0Beijing\u2019s baseline assumption is that Washington and its allies will remain hostile to China for the foreseeable future. Thus, Xi is open to negotiations because he wants some breathing room on the economic front, so China can marshal its forces for a long-term competition.\n\nBeijing remains concerned that Trump\u2019s team will focus on deeper economic decoupling, regime change in China and support for Taiwan independence, all as means to contain and destabilise China. Hence Xi\u2019s four \u201cred lines\u201d at a November meeting with President Joe Biden in Peru in a clear message to the incoming administration.\n\nBeijing\u2019s planned responses to Trump fall into three baskets: retaliation, adaptation and diversification.\u00a0Mirroring US policies, Beijing in recent years has created a range of export controls, investment restrictions and regulatory investigations capable of hurting US companies. Beijing is unable to match tariff for tariff, so it will seek to impose costs in ways that inflict maximum pain. For China, failing to retaliate would signal weakness domestically and only encourage Trump.\n\nThis has already started. In late 2024, Beijing blocked the export to the US of critical minerals used for chipmaking, squeezed the supply chain for US-made drones, threatened to blacklist a high-profile US apparel company and launched an antitrust probe into Nvidia. By taking such actions, Beijing is previewing its capabilities and creating future bargaining chips.\n\nChina\u2019s second strategy is adaptation. From autumn 2023, Beijing began a vigorous fiscal and monetary stimulus to help businesses and now consumers. This policy shift is generating some positive, though uneven, impacts. It was certainly badly needed, but its scope and nature were also developed with a possible trade war in mind.\n\nBeijing\u2019s third strategy involves expanding its economic ties. It is debating unilateral tariff cuts on imports from non-US partners. On his Peru trip, Xi inaugurated a deep-water port that could reshape China\u2019s trade with Latin America, a key non-US source of food, energy and minerals. In late 2024, Xi also participated for the first time in meetings with the heads of 10 major international economic organisations. His message was clear: China will be the leading force for global economic stability, prosperity and openness, and opposes all forms of protectionism.\n\nMuch could go wrong. Beijing\u2019s confidence is matched by that of the Trump team. Both sides believe they possess the upper hand, can impose more costs and withstand more pain. The stage is set for a complicated, destabilising dynamic which, at best, results in a ceasefire. And that\u2019s only on economic issues, not on Taiwan, the South China Sea, tech competition or nuclear force modernisation. The cold war is starting to look quaint in comparison.\n\n\u200bLetter in response to this article:\n\nChina is ill-equipped to fight a tariff war\u00a0/\u00a0From Mihir Torsekar, Alexandria, VA, US", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ca79e423-7c0f-4883-a295-6fe1c73a2819"}, {"uuid4": "eb435cad-6d4d-4d83-b1f5-187582131c21", "title": "Five green finance questions for 2025 ", "description": "The new year will bring tough challenges for investors in the energy transition", "author": "Lee Harris", "published_date": "2025-01-03T12:01:18.352Z", "content": "Happy new year. 2025 is set to be a challenging, tumultuous year for businesses and investors in the green transition \u2014 and a very busy one for journalists covering the subject. Below are five of the key questions we\u2019ll be tracking this year. What are yours? Let us know at moralmoneyreply@ft.com. \u2014 Simon Mundy\n\nAt a time of severe political polarisation in the US, a crackdown on Chinese green tech imports is one of the few things that has bipartisan support. Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike want to reduce US economic reliance on a strategic rival and weaken China\u2019s grip on global clean energy supply chains.\n\nPresident Joe Biden rolled out his most recent series of restrictions on Chinese products, including solar panels and electric vehicles, last month. The incoming Trump administration is almost certain to raise these barriers still higher, as part of its push to reduce the trade deficit with China.\n\nThe EU, too, has been putting new restrictions on Chinese clean energy imports, and is likely to double down on this stance under European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s more right-leaning second administration. One notable new tack is a push for Chinese companies to transfer intellectual property to European businesses, in exchange for the right to operate in the EU and benefit from its subsidy regimes.\n\nJust how far the west will go in toughening up trade rules is a crucial question. So too is how severely China\u2019s green tech sector will be affected, and how it will respond \u2014 whether by retaliating with trade restrictions of its own, or by redoubling its efforts to grow clean tech exports to friendlier developing economies.\n\nA still more important question is how far this lurch towards green protectionism will slow down the energy transition. A recent paper published by the Carnegie Endowment warned that, given Chinese producers\u2019 superior scale and cost-efficiency in crucial parts of the clean energy supply chain, these trade measures \u201ccould result in a deeper and abrupt decoupling that is hugely disruptive at a critical time\u201d.\n\nInstead, it argued for a \u201cclean energy d\u00e9tente\u201d between the US and China, saying a healthier trading relationship would catalyse wider co-operation between China and the west, and accelerate global climate action. It\u2019s a compelling vision \u2014 but one that only the most committed optimist would view as likely in 2025. (Simon Mundy)\n\nLast November\u2019s COP29 summit in Baku concluded in disappointment for developing nation representatives who had hoped for a radical expansion of international climate finance. Rich nations\u2019 pledge to mobilise $300bn a year by 2035 fell far short of what expert estimates had deemed necessary.\n\nStill, there is clearly growing global awareness of the need for expanded climate finance in lower-income nations. In 2025, we\u2019ll be watching to see whether this will translate into results.\n\nOne huge question concerns the US approach under Trump, who has vowed to pull the US out of the Paris agreement and is likely to take an axe to climate-focused foreign aid. This was a factor behind other rich nations\u2019 reluctance to make generous pledges in Baku, and much will depend on how far they\u2019re prepared to pick up any financial slack left by Washington.\n\nThere\u2019s also an opportunity for economies such as China and the Gulf states, which are not obliged to contribute climate finance under the Paris agreement, to build soft power by expanding the voluntary support they offer lower-income nations, notably in Africa.\n\nWith the limits of bilateral support increasingly stark, multilateral development banks \u2014 especially the World Bank Group \u2014 will be under growing pressure to show a more proactive, less risk-averse approach to catalysing private investment.\n\nThe competition among developing nation governments to attract green finance will heat up this year, whether through green bond programmes like Kenya\u2019s or through tax and subsidy regimes that have been rolled out from Uganda to Bangladesh.\n\nIn 2024, clean energy investment reached a record $2tn, according to the International Energy Agency \u2014 yet only 15 per cent of this was spent in developing countries (excluding China), which account for two-thirds of the world\u2019s population. This year, we\u2019ll get a better sense of whether this imbalance can be addressed. (Simon Mundy)\n\nWith global warming super-charging floods, wildfires and other natural hazards, homeowners in exposed areas are struggling to find affordable insurance. Governments are incentivised to keep premiums low and to shoulder more of the risk \u2014 leaving them exposed to catastrophic events that could generate massive public liabilities, with ripple effects for markets.\n\nLawmakers such as US senator Sheldon Whitehouse have raised concerns that the retreat of major insurers could set off \u201ca crash in property values\u201d or push state insurers to seek federal bailouts.\n\nAs of December, insured losses from natural catastrophes were on track to exceed $135bn in 2024, according to Swiss Re. Two-thirds of these losses were in the US. But Europe\u2019s insured losses from flooding, totalling $10bn, were the second-highest figure from that class of disaster that the region had ever seen. In October, devastating floods in Spain killed more than 220 people, with insured losses likely to exceed \u20ac4bn ($4.2bn), according to Morningstar estimates.\n\nYet there are signs that reinsurance prices, one factor behind rising consumer insurance costs, may be easing slightly. Over the past two years, reinsurers such as Munich Re have raised their pricing to levels that have raked in record profits. Their expanded balance sheets are now giving them scope to trim rates. The cost of property catastrophe reinsurance fell 8 per cent globally on January 1, when policies typically renew, according to Howden, the insurance broker.\n\nAccording to a recent report by risk modelling firm Verisk, last year\u2019s losses were actually mild by the standards of the years to come. It claimed that the world should expect an annual average of $151bn in insured losses, and much worse in bad years. This year will give new insights on how climate change is altering the risks faced by the insurance sector \u2014 and on how insurers are responding. (Lee Harris)\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence was one of the biggest business stories of 2024. And AI\u2019s voracious appetite for electricity has been one of the most significant themes in clean energy. In a landmark deal in September, Microsoft and Constellation Energy said they would reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, underscoring desperation among giant technology companies to shore up their power supplies.\n\nIn 2025, the AI challenge for electricity grids is likely to get worse.\n\nLast month, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, an industry watchdog, warned that AI power consumption could cause blackouts in the US and Canada during peak demand.\n\n\u201cDemand growth is now higher than at any point in the last two decades,\u201d the NERC said.\n\nMicrosoft and the other technology giants play an enormous role in determining whether or not increasing AI-related electricity demand will be fulfilled by clean energy. With Donald Trump returning to the White House this month, the federal government will not be a driving force for low-carbon power. But Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and the other tech leaders have the deep pockets to pay for it.\n\nHeading into 2025, one of the biggest questions in clean energy will be whether the large tech players will continue to spend on nuclear, solar and wind as the federal government shifts its focus towards fossil fuels. (Patrick Temple-West)\n\nSustainable investing was thrown in reverse in the US in 2024. Investor demand for environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds slowed in 2024 as Republican politicians ramped up their ESG attacks.\n\nShortly after Trump\u2019s win in November, Republican-led states filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, accusing the three largest US index fund managers of using their holdings in coal producers to constrict supplies in pursuit of net zero carbon emissions goals.\n\nThis litigation will be closely watched in 2025 to see if it is successful and if it expands to other companies.\n\n\u201cThe anti-ESG backlash movement is trying to accomplish its goals by leveraging antitrust risk, but also the perception of risk,\u201d Drake Morgan, a counsel at Crowell & Moring, told me. \u201cCompanies may have a hard time telling those apart because the antitrust theories these accusations involve are notoriously slippery and courts haven\u2019t provided much clarification, at least not recently,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA few years ago, antitrust risk wasn\u2019t as much of a focus when companies were considering their ESG policies\u201d, Morgan said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now isn\u2019t a course correction, so much as the evolution of risk management as enforcement priorities shift.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have obviously set their sights on dismantling ESG and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) programmes. A crucial question this year will be about terminology. Will financial companies keep pursuing sustainable finance strategies using different language \u2014 or abandon them altogether? (Patrick Temple-West)\n\nGale force The UK government\u2019s plans to expand renewable energy are facing resistance from some local communities.\n\nWater warning The EU\u2019s new environment commissioner says the bloc has neglected the increasing threat of water shortages.\n\nNorthward bound Climate change is reshaping the map of Europe\u2019s wine industry.", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8931fa02-961e-4a8b-92ac-36feb7e81547"}, {"uuid4": "e853aabb-d396-4c69-8e3c-914e115837ad", "title": "A new Monroe doctrine is unlikely to work for the US in South America", "description": "Washington\u2019s leverage over countries in the region is waning as China\u2019s influence grows", "author": "Will Freeman", "published_date": "2025-01-03T05:00:22.932Z", "content": "The writer is\u2009fellow for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations\n\nDonald Trump wants to roll back China\u2019s growing footprint in Latin America. He isn\u2019t above strong-arm tactics to do it. Just see his latest demand to reassume control of the Panama Canal, which a senior Trump appointee afterwards suggested was really about pushing back against China.\n\nBut if, or rather when, the pressure does come bearing down, don\u2019t expect all of Latin America to respond the same way. Instead, be prepared for the region to divide less along ideological lines than geographic ones \u2014 into a northern half more tightly welded to Washington and a southern half likely to drift, especially if pushed, towards Beijing.\n\nMany believe Washington needs a positive agenda to compete effectively with China: carrots, not just sticks, like expanded access to markets in the US and more abundant development financing. And they\u2019re right.\n\nBut assume for a moment that threats remain Trump\u2019s lingua franca \u2014 ones like the proposed 60 per cent tariffs on all goods that pass through the new Chinese-owned and operated mega-port of Chancay in Peru, or 200 per cent tariffs on Mexican-made cars, which Trump fears China could exploit as a backdoor into the US market.\n\nThreats only work when they are backed by leverage. But the US\u2019s leverage is not evenly distributed across the region. In Mexico and much of Central America and the Caribbean, Washington still holds most of the cards. Mexico still sends 80 per cent of its exports to the US, for instance.\n\nBut head to South America, and the picture changes. China is the continent\u2019s top trading partner, while five of the Latin American countries most indebted to China, and four of the five that have received the most Chinese FDI, are in South America.\n\nThe best evidence that South American leaders won\u2019t necessarily be easily swayed or cajoled by Washington is Argentina\u2019s Trump-loving president Javier Milei. Milei, who once compared China\u2019s leaders to \u201cmurderers\u201d and openly adores Trump, at first cancelled plans for a Chinese-built nuclear power plant and mega-port. But by October, they were \u201cinteresting business partners\u201d, and a new natural gas export deal, a currency swap deal to boost the country\u2019s depleted reserves and a state visit to Beijing were all in the works.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, pressure didn\u2019t dissuade conservative presidents in Colombia and Brazil from deepening tech and trade ties to China, either. And these were South American leaders who like Trump. Now imagine the ones who don\u2019t.\n\nSouth America\u2019s major economies will resist picking sides. But if push comes to shove, it\u2019s hard to see them distancing much from Beijing. If pressure backfires, and South America swings further east,\u00a0there will\u00a0be consequences for security dynamics in the Pacific, critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains, and more.\n\nNowhere is the risk of pressure backfiring greater than in Colombia, one of the top recipients of US assistance worldwide.\u00a0The country\u2019s leftist incumbent, Gustavo Petro, has continued the trend. He is expected to usher Colombia into Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative in 2025 and possibly join the Brics bank. With two years left and few internal constraints, Petro could turn even more sharply towards China in response to unmeasured heavy handedness, potentially costing the US its closest regional ally.\n\nTrump and his party\u2019s leaders have spoken repeatedly about reasserting the \u201cMonroe doctrine\u201d \u2014 the idea that the US must keep geopolitical adversaries out of the hemisphere. But China is not like the Soviet Union, the last real target of that doctrine. The Soviets and Cuba had soft power but little economic heft. China\u2019s\u00a0presence, especially in South America, is much greater.\n\nChina is different from the USSR in another way. Laser-focused on strategic advantage, it is agnostic towards regimes, happy to work with anyone. \u201cThey do not demand anything,\u201d Milei said of China, seemingly warmly. True. China heaped loans on Venezuela socialists, Milei\u2019s arch-rivals, as the country collapsed.\n\nFor Latin America, the most serious risk of the current moment is that the US, in a misguided effort to compete, adopts the same attitude: oppose China fervently enough, and democracy and rule of law are no longer concerns.\n\nTrump should worry about whether his planned diplomatic hardball will work, and where it might backfire. Latin America should beware such a race to the bottom.", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d2e9255d-21e2-48a8-8c13-01a5899559e2"}, {"uuid4": "59b452dd-0ca0-4a67-99b2-5d6111c0af2a", "title": "Magic monkey tale inspires China\u2019s gaming industry to seek blockbuster success ", "description": "As Beijing eases regulations, developers are tooling up to produce big-budget titles with international appeal", "author": "Eleanor Olcott", "published_date": "2025-01-03T03:38:04.568Z", "content": "China\u2019s video game industry is scaling up to release more blockbusters in 2025 after the breakout global success of \u201ctriple-A\u201d title Black Myth: Wukong.\n\nIn August, little-known Chinese developer Game Science achieved one of the fastest-selling debuts in gaming history with 10mn copies sold in three days of a title inspired by a classical Chinese novel about an anthropomorphic monkey with supernatural powers.\n\nThe action role-playing game has since earned $1.1bn, with nearly 25mn copies sold, according to estimates from gaming consultancy Niko Partners. About 70 per cent of sales came in China.\n\nThe game\u2019s appeal both at home and abroad goes beyond its state of the art graphics, fun gameplay and strong character development, according to one typical fan.\n\n\u201cHu,\u201d a 29-year-old former tech worker in Beijing, said: \u201cThe biggest difference is that this is an authentically Chinese game, incorporating a wealth of historical, cultural and martial arts elements far more genuine than the occasional Chinese flavour found in other games.\u201d\n\nDevelopers have taken it up a notch to achieve that. The game is China\u2019s first major triple-A title \u2014 an unofficial designation for games with large budgets and lengthy development cycles released for gaming PCs and consoles rather than smartphones.\n\n\u201cBlack Myth: Wukong put Chinese developers firmly on the map for triple-A premium games,\u201d said Daniel Ahmad, Niko Partners\u2019 research director.\n\nIndustry insiders hope this will rekindle investment in a domestic gaming sector recovering from a regulatory crackdown that began in 2021, when children were banned from playing video games for more than an hour on certain days.\n\nThe industry has been suffering globally with mass lay-offs, tepid revenue growth and spiralling development costs, particularly in the US. In China, it is still recovering from the 18-month break in gaming approvals from June 2021, which prompted investors to pull back and forced a wave of closures of smaller studios. Authorities have since resumed issuing licences.\n\n\u201cThe success of Black Myth makes developers dare to chase dreams and reach for triple-A projects,\u201d said one gaming developer at a Shenzhen-based studio backed by Tencent. But he added he had not yet seen venture capital investment return with any vigour.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong also received an enthusiastic reception from state media. It celebrated its role in promoting a positive view of China overseas, indicating a more accommodating political view on gaming.\n\nThe state-run China Daily published an opinion piece saying it was \u201cexhilarating to see China break the long-standing Western dominance in the high-end gaming market and Western gamers embrace traditional Chinese culture\u201d. This contrasted with state media in 2021 accusing the industry of promoting \u201cspiritual opium\u201d.\n\nThe game is leading a shift in China towards larger budgets and more ambitious titles that can compete internationally, with anticipation growing about projects, including Phantom Blade Zero from Beijing-based S-Game and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers by the Chengdu-based Leenzee, due for release later this year. The Tencent-backed studio Chengdu Ophiuchus Technology and the independent developer Digisky are also working on triple-A projects.\n\n\u201cBefore this game, Chinese developers were best at making free-to-play games, especially for mobile\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they had not conquered the triple-A premium space,\u201d Ahmad said.\n\nChina\u2019s largest gaming company, Tencent, is still heavily invested in mobile. Its domestic gaming revenues returned to growth in 2024, with the release of its hit smartphone game Dungeon & Fighter Mobile, after several years of waiting for regulatory approval.\n\n\u201cDnF Mobile has been an important factor in Tencent\u2019s strong gaming performance this year,\u201d said Robin Zhu, internet analyst at Bernstein. Tencent\u2019s domestic gaming revenue grew by 6 per cent in the first nine months of 2024 to Rmb106bn ($14.6bn).\n\nBeijing has also stepped up the pace of granting new gaming licences, in another sign that the government has adopted a more favourable stance. In the first 11 months of 2024, Beijing approved nearly 1,300 games, already outstripping last year\u2019s total, according to Niko data.\n\nZhu said the strength of Tencent\u2019s domestic gaming business showed that even though consumers were shopping less, they were still willing to spend on gaming.\n\n\u201cPeople are reining in on ecommerce but putting more money on experiences and services,\u201d he said.\n\nBut 2024 was not a strong year for all China\u2019s gaming companies, with number-two player NetEase seeing gaming revenue fall by 4 per cent to Rmb21bn in the third quarter. Analysts blamed in part the fading popularity of Eggy Party, a multiplayer obstacle-course casual video game.\n\nAhmad said that Black Myth: Wukong\u2019s release showed how China had learnt how to tool up for bigger games.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s gaming industry has gone through an industrialisation process. Before, they found it hard to compete with the likes of Activision Blizzard. But the Chinese studios have brought in foreign experts, scaled their teams, standardised tools and production processes, focusing on high- production values, popular gameplay mechanics, and deep progression systems that can help them compete globally.\u201d\n\nWhile they were going head to head with international gaming giants, Chinese developers had a cost advantage, he said, with the country\u2019s vast pool of talented and cheap engineers.

The PBoC also fears that credit growth targets lead to indiscriminate lending without consideration for risk, which is wasteful in the long run.\n\n\u201cAligning with the requirements of high-quality development, these quantitative targets have been phased out in recent years,\u201d said the central bank. \u201cThe PBoC will pay more attention to the role of interest rate control, and improve the formation and transmission of market-oriented interest rates.\u201d\n\nAs part of the change in regime, the PBoC clarified last year that its main policy instrument would be the seven-day reverse repo rate rather than the host of interest rates it has relied on to date.\n\nA reduced emphasis on targets for credit growth could rein in the rampant overcapacity in China that has led to bad debts at home and disruption to global industries such as steel.\n\nBut the central bank has been struggling to implement its shift towards interest rates because the government wants to channel money to the high-tech and manufacturing sectors, which is easier under the old system of credit expansion.\n\nEven as it tries to make a structural change in policy, the PBoC is also under pressure to reflate China\u2019s economy.\n\nDuring 2024, as part of the most aggressive stimulus package since the Covid-19 pandemic, the central bank cut the seven-day rate twice and a five-year rate that influences mortgage prices three times.\n\nThe moves came in the context of President Xi Jinping\u2019s pledge to achieve economic growth of 5 per cent despite troubles in China\u2019s property sector and trade tensions with the US.\n\nPBoC governor Pan Gongsheng and his predecessors Yi Gang and Zhou Xiaochuan have pushed for risk-based pricing of loans in recent meetings with officials from some of China\u2019s biggest banks, according to attendees.\n\nBankers at the meetings warned of possible confusion when pricing longer-term loans since the market is accustomed to guidance from the PBoC, highlighting the challenge of moving to the new system.\n\nFor international investors, if the PBoC is successful, then Chinese monetary policy will start to resemble the system they are used to in the US, Europe or Japan.\n\nFor the first time in two decades, the central bank also bought government bonds in the open market to inject money into the financial system in 2024, in the same way that the Fed conducts its policy.\n\nAnalysts said the PBoC still lacked some essential ingredients for a system based on interest rates, such as a schedule of routine, publicly disclosed meetings to make policy decisions.\n\nWithout such guidance, \u201cmarket participants might find themselves guessing what will happen next\u201d, said Haibin Zhu, China economist at JPMorgan Chase.", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/794577b2-6bdd-4a03-bfab-19463543048a"}, {"uuid4": "59d14701-ea50-4889-a708-1dbc62a31bb6", "title": "China\u2019s electric-vehicle leader BYD posts record sales in 2024", "description": "Bigger companies beat targets as intense competition rocks world\u2019s biggest car market", "author": "Gloria Li", "published_date": "2025-01-02T12:04:44.790Z", "content": "China\u2019s best-selling car manufacturer BYD sold a record number of electric vehicles and hybrids globally last year, even as fierce competition took hold in its home market.\n\nTesla\u2019s biggest rival sold 4.3mn EVs and hybrids in 2024, far more than the target of 3.6mn it set earlier, according to the company. \u201cChina\u2019s champion, the world\u2019s champion,\u201d the company said in a social media post late on Wednesday.\n\nBYD sold 1.76mn pure EVs last year, but not enough to oust Tesla as the world\u2019s biggest-selling EV maker.

It was a two-hour, standing room only slog by commuter train from Shanghai. When I arrived, the only people wandering among the pavilions were fellow international tourists \u2014 locals were too busy working for such frivolity.\n\nI returned recently, some 22 years after that first trip. It is unrecognisable. Suzhou is now a city of 7mn people \u2014 25 minutes by bullet train from Shanghai. Admission to the town\u2019s acclaimed museum is by app and tickets are sold to a growing army of Chinese tourists, normally by mid-morning.\n\nEveryone knows China has changed, but I wonder how many Western investors comprehend just how much and in what ways. And, if you want to invest successfully there, you need to understand this.\n\nChina has been a disappointment for investors since Covid. The lockdown was so much more severe there than in the west \u2014 its population was not cushioned by furlough payments. Economic recovery has been much slower and the Chinese stock market too easy to shun.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory raises the spectre of punitive tariffs on Chinese imports into the US. He repeatedly cited a figure of 60 per cent during the election campaign and in November warned of \u201can additional 10 per cent tariff, above any additional tariffs\u201d (sic).\n\nTrump\u2019s bark may yet prove worse than his bite \u2014 as it was when he imposed tariffs on China in early 2018. His nominee as Treasury Secretary, billionaire financier Scott Bessent, has described 60 per cent as a \u201cmaximalist\u201d position and said of the president-elect: \u201cMy general view is that at the end of the day he\u2019s a free trader. It\u2019s escalate to de-escalate.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that the US share of Chinese exports is down to 14.5 per cent today, compared with 19 per cent in 2017, so it\u2019s not as dependent as it used to be.\n\nArguably more relevant to investors are the recent promises of Chinese government stimulus. Share prices have risen by more than 26 per cent on average in the past couple of months, but they are still cheap by many measures \u2014 and could represent an opportunity.\n\nChina\u2019s affluent middle class is set to grow by 80mn by 2030 (equivalent to nearly a quarter of the US population as a whole). And this growth will be amplified if the Chinese can be encouraged to change some of their financial habits.\n\nOne of the big reasons for China\u2019s economic slump was the unwillingness of its people to spend. In the west we save on average around 7 per cent of our income. In China it\u2019s nearer 35 per cent.\n\nThere is a reason for this. Despite being a nominally communist state, China can be ruthlessly capitalist. There is no national health service and insurance and pension industries are fledgling (though rich in potential). Families need a bigger safety net.\n\nRemember too, that this is a country that has only recently become wealthy and has an ageing population. Muscle memory and the handed-down stories of grandparents who barely had enough to get by have a powerful impact on spending habits. Covid reinforced this.\n\nThe consequence is that whereas about two-thirds of GDP is typically derived from consumer spending globally, in China it is just over one-third.\n\nWhat has driven China\u2019s economic miracle has been infrastructure spending \u2014 investment in property and modern roads and speeding trains that have drawn hundreds of millions from rural areas to the country\u2019s fast-growing urban centres (3mn a year to Shanghai alone).\n\nThe Chinese government knows that the next phase of growth cannot come from infrastructure \u2014 it must come, at least partially, from consumption \u2014 from supporting the rise of the middle class and encouraging people to spend more. The two in tandem could be powerful drivers of growth.\n\nIf the government in Beijing succeeds, the winners will not be yesterday\u2019s winners \u2014 for a long time the Western companies that jumped in to establish an early presence as the country\u2019s economic revolution gathered steam. With more choice, consumers are becoming more discerning in their purchases, and we are seeing the rise of domestic brands that are often more adept at reading and catering to the consumer mood.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Samsung\u2019s recent troubles are in part because Chinese brands such as Huawei, Vivo, OPPO and Xiaomi have virtually pushed it out of the smartphone market in China.\n\nThe country\u2019s electric car industry, with the benefits of government subsidies, has established a similar grip on the domestic market. BYD produced 1.76mn EVs in 2024,\u00a0close to Tesla\u2019s 1.79mn\u00a0\u2014 but it also built another\u00a02.49mn hybrids. In four years China has overtaken the US, South Korea, Japan and Germany to become the world\u2019s leading car exporter. Chinese manufacturers on track to become well-known names over here \u2014 beyond BYD \u2014 include Dongfeng, SAIC (owner of the MG brand), Nio and Xpeng. It is a similar story in fashion and cosmetics: look out for Icicle and Proya.\n\nFor me, the bigger question investors should ask is not whether the Chinese will spend again, but how. As Beijing continues to take steps to address the fallout from the real estate implosion \u2014 which has undoubtedly played a big role in curbing consumer spending in recent years \u2014 new market opportunities are arising.\n\nOne area that has seen rapid growth since Covid is health and fitness. Running has become hugely popular. Beneficiaries include Adidas and the Chinese brand Anta. And then there is tourism \u2014\u00a0now back at pre-Covid levels and up 32 per cent year on year. Trip.com is already benefiting from this trend.\n\nHistorically, the safest way to play China\u2019s growth story was to buy Western companies exposed to the Chinese market. Some may say that is still the case \u2014 but concerns remain that the state will arbitrarily undermine international businesses seen to cross a line in its eyes.\n\nNevertheless, I believe some of the best opportunities come from spotting the domestic brands that have taken root in China and are growing strongly. Investing in China is not as simple as it was, but from this low valuation point the potential rewards are arguably greater than ever, despite Trump.\n\nSwetha Ramachandran is a global equity manager at Artemis\n\nThis article has been updated since original publication to include the latest BYD and Tesla production figures", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/85e009e0-bc2e-42a2-958b-b029b17606ac"}, {"uuid4": "c6c196ae-daf0-4f8e-8d4c-464454d1e755", "title": "The EU\u2019s impossible choice on trade and tariffs", "description": "Trump\u2019s threat of higher duties on Chinese goods raises the stakes for a union proud of its free-trading instincts", "author": "Andy Bounds", "published_date": "2025-01-01T11:00:57.396Z", "content": "The EU, a political project conceived to remove trade barriers, has been raising tariff walls at its fastest rate in 15 years. But just as fast as the defences are built against cheap Chinese imports, fresh storms blow the bloc off balance again.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s threat to impose levies of up to 60 per cent on Chinese goods would, for instance, put an even higher tariff wall around the US than anything the EU has planned.\n\nThe effect, if the US president follows through, would be to divert Chinese goods from the US to the EU \u2014 forcing Brussels to in turn consider hitting back with even tougher defensive measures.\n\nIt is an impossible situation for a union that has taken pride in its free-trading instincts. Every barrier it erects can save some domestic jobs but will also reduce the competitiveness of other domestic industries by raising the price of imports.\n\nWith China now accounting for 30 per cent of global industrial output, the ripple effects will be considerable on EU products ranging from electric vehicles to Italian tomato paste.\n\nVulnerable industries, such as steel and glass fibre makers, complain the EU has not been building trade defences fast enough or high enough to save them. \u201cWe are close to a tipping point for many industries,\u201d said Laurent Ruessmann, a partner with RB Legal and trade defence expert.\n\nOn the other hand, those who want cheap Chinese inputs to keep their own product prices down, such as paint makers, have lobbied against tariff measures. The EU has put duties on titanium dioxide, a key ingredient, leaving paint makers worried they will have to absorb the cost or lose sales.\n\nSimon Evenett, professor of geopolitics and strategy at IMD Business School, said tariffs always ended up costing consumers or other businesses.\n\n\u201cEurope\u2019s dilemma is either to sacrifice jobs downstream by slapping tariffs on Chinese imports or watch EU producers shrink by doing nothing. When it comes to protectionism, someone\u2019s ox always gets gored.\u201d\n\nHowever, Aegis Europe, which represents heavy industries such as steel and chemicals, argued that the EU was sitting on the fence.\n\nTrade defence measures cover far less of its EU imports than other trading blocs, according to Aegis. The number of tariffs has grown to their highest level since 2009, with 141 in force in 2023. But rebased against total imports, the US, Australia and Canada have more than 10 times larger protective shields.\n\n\u201cClaims that EU manufacturers use trade defence as a protectionist tool do not stand up to scrutiny,\u201d it said in a report.\n\nBrussels has responded. In a move asked for by Aegis, it now automatically registers imports when a trade investigation is opened. It can then backdate tariffs if it wishes, deterring stockpiling during the months-long probe to beat the price rises.\n\nBut even with tariffs in place, China has tended to find ways around them. Since the EU put anti-subsidy duties in 2010 on glass fibre \u2014 used in construction, wind turbines and other industries \u2014 Chinese producers have doubled their market share.\n\nAfter the tariffs were imposed, imports started surging from Egypt. China\u2019s state-owned Jushi had opened a plant there, and Brussels eventually put tariffs on Egypt too.\n\nLudovic Piraux, chief executive of producer 3B and president of Glass Fibre Europe, said the tariffs were ultimately too low. \u201cCompanies operating within a market economy like ours cannot withstand the relentless attacks from Chinese state-subsidised competitors,\u201d he said.\n\nThe steel industry is feeling the squeeze most \u2014 hobbled by weak demand, high energy costs and regulation forcing it to invest to eliminate carbon emissions.\n\nSteel production hit its lowest ever level \u2014 128mn tonnes \u2014 in 2023, according to Eurofer, the lobby group. Trump put tariffs on the metal in his first term in an effort to protect his voters in the industrial heartland of the US, and could reactivate them within days of his return.\n\nAxel Eggert, Eurofer director-general, said: \u201cWe have to decide if we want a European steel industry or not.\u201d\n\nCarmakers \u2014 themselves now partially protected by tariffs from a surge of cheap, allegedly subsidised Chinese electric vehicle imports \u2014 needed EU steel, Eggert argued. While they might be tempted by cheaper Chinese offerings to lower their costs, \u201cas soon as we are gone, the Chinese will raise prices\u201d.\n\nThe EU might be tempted to reopen talks with the US on a \u201cgreen steel club\u201d, which would allow tariff free trade between members while those outside pay.\n\nThis was once dismissed by Brussels as incompatible with World Trade Organization rules. But senior EU officials now hint that they could be flexible in interpreting the rules.\n\nIn this hostile environment, even good students of trade multilateralism may find it impossible to stick to their principles.", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d530c163-2bba-4f54-9bc9-dfcc9b96c669"}, {"uuid4": "3ccdad84-8a98-4130-9aff-a158bfec3e6f", "title": "US investors in China venture funds race to comply with new tech rules", "description": "Financial institutions rush to secure assurances their money is not being used to develop Chinese technology", "author": "George Hammond", "published_date": "2025-01-01T05:00:57.236Z", "content": "US investors in Chinese venture capital funds are racing to comply with new rules banning them from backing companies that develop artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies used by the People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\nMeasures by the Biden administration, which come into force on Thursday, impose civil and criminal penalties for US entities that invest in Chinese companies involved in semiconductors, quantum computing or AI systems that could be used by China\u2019s military.\n\nThe rules introduce a hefty due diligence burden on US investors.

From this month, China Eastern will fly the C919 between Hong Kong and Shanghai, its first regular commercial route outside China\u2019s mainland.\n\nYang Yang, the company\u2019s deputy general manager of marketing and sales, told the Financial Times the company was aiming for the single-aisle plane to be flying in south-east Asia by 2026 and to gain European certification as early as this year.\n\n\u201cWe hope to operate more of the jets domestically in China and to thoroughly identify any issues before\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009bringing them to south-east Asia,\u201d he said.\n\nThe C919 is a pivotal project in President Xi Jinping\u2019s drive for China to move up the technology value chain, with the ultimate aim of challenging the western duopoly of Boeing and Airbus.\n\nBoeing\u2019s financial woes and delivery delays, as well as wider supply chain problems in the industry that have left it and Airbus facing engine and component shortages, have weighed on the global aviation sector and offered hope for newcomers.\n\nThe world will need 42,430 new aircraft over the next two decades, roughly 80 per cent of which will be single-aisle aircraft, according to an Airbus forecast in 2024. Aviation consultancy IBA predicts that Comac can raise its output of C919s \u2014 16 of which have been delivered to Chinese airlines as of December \u2014 from one to 11 a month by 2040, by which time it can deliver almost 2,000 units of the aircraft.\n\nHowever, Jonathan McDonald, IBA\u2019s manager for classic and cargo aircraft, said that while Comac would eventually penetrate export markets, \u201cfor the foreseeable future Airbus and Boeing will be the main suppliers of narrow-bodies to most airlines\u201d.\n\nGlobal certification and maintenance support remain significant hurdles to Comac\u2019s ambition for the C919 to operate overseas.\n\nIn a move to boost its international presence, Comac opened new overseas outposts in Singapore and Hong Kong in October.\n\nThe new offices were necessary to help drive aircraft orders from customers, according to Mayur Patel, head of Asia for OAG Aviation.\n\nBut Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, said building \u201celaborate product support facilities in export markets is very hard and expensive work, and a necessary precondition for competing with Airbus and Boeing\u201d.\n\nWhile several carriers in Asia have expressed interest in the C919, some executives say privately that they remain hesitant.\n\n\u201cMaintenance support is the main issue,\u201d said a person close to Indonesia\u2019s TransNusa, which has already received three of Comac\u2019s smaller ARJ21 aircraft and is considering flying the C919.\n\nThe path for Comac to gain overseas certification, particularly from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, is also challenging, according to analysts.\n\n\u201cIBA does not expect the C919 to be certified in Europe in the immediate future,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cEurope has very strict certification parameters.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, certification from the US Federal Aviation Authority is likely to be complicated by US-China tensions.\n\nEU and US regulators are often the \u201cgold standard\u201d for other global authorities, according to David Yu, an aviation industry expert at NYU Shanghai.\n\nIn parallel with its push with the C919, Comac is also developing its first widebody aircraft, the C929. At one of China\u2019s largest air shows in Zhuhai in November, the company announced that state-owned Air China had become the first airline to pledge to fly the jet, which is aimed at challenging the larger planes made by Airbus and Boeing such as the 787 Dreamliner.\n\nSash Tusa, a UK-based aerospace and defence analyst, said that while the C929 offered China another opportunity to prove its technological advancement in the aerospace sector, the country would still probably be reliant on overseas engines for commercial jets. IBA estimates that the C929 will not come into service before 2040.\n\nFor the C919, key components are still western-made. The jet\u2019s engines are supplied by Franco-American venture CFM International while its auxiliary power units are made by US-based Honeywell.\n\n\u201cSo far, [Comac is] building aircraft that are mostly western by value, but with Chinese structures,\u201d said AeroDynamic Advisory\u2019s Aboulafia. \u201cThat makes production ramps dependent on western willingness to continue providing systems, and, given a Trump presidency, there\u2019s no guarantee of that at all.\u201d\n\nComac would probably not be able to get any \u201cfair share of the global market\u201d within the next decade, Tusa said, but would provide an important \u201cimport substitution\u201d for domestic Chinese airlines.\n\n\u201cAirbus builds in China. Boeing doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cSo Comac comes in as the second supplier. Import substitution doesn\u2019t make you a competitor. That makes you an act of state policy.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by William Langley in Guangzhou", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7510f691-d9f6-4f07-86ad-8ba3b91517d3"}, {"uuid4": "df2edb83-0510-41c3-abf5-d87c23916dd2", "title": "Xi Jinping signals growth is priority in speech acknowledging China\u2019s strains", "description": "President uses new year address to stress support for country\u2019s vulnerable people and reiterate Taiwan stance ", "author": "Edward White", "published_date": "2024-12-31T12:49:08.896Z", "content": "Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed support for the country\u2019s vulnerable elderly and youth in a new year address that acknowledged the strains on some of the 1.4bn-strong population.\n\nXi\u2019s speech comes after his economic planners have for much of the past four years struggled to restore consumer confidence or address rising youth unemployment and slow wage growth.\n\nIn the televised speech on Tuesday evening the 71-year-old leader, speaking in front of a large motif of the Great Wall, said that issues of employment, income growth, elderly care, childcare, education and healthcare \u201care always on my mind\u201d.\n\nXi said that a July meeting of the Chinese Communist party leadership had sounded a \u201cclarion call for further comprehensive deepening of reform\u201d.\n\n\u201cEnabling people to live happy lives is the top priority,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery household hopes that children can receive good education, the elderly can have good care services, and young people can have more development opportunities.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s economy, which is the world\u2019s second biggest behind the US, recorded growth of 4.8 per cent in the first nine months of the year, trailing Beijing\u2019s official target of about 5 per cent.\n\nWeak sentiment and deflationary pressures follow a series of blows, from the pandemic and a years-long property market slump, to Xi\u2019s reassertion of Communist party control over large swaths of China\u2019s business landscape.\n\nXi on Tuesday also repeated a thinly veiled warning over international support for Taiwan. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has not ruled out using force if Taipei refuses unification indefinitely.\n\n\u201cCompatriots on both sides of the Strait are one family. No one can sever our blood ties and kinship, and no one can stop the historical trend of national reunification,\u201d Xi said.\n\nXi has increasingly steered state support for high-tech manufacturing and industry, lifting investment in electric vehicles, batteries, semiconductors and artificial intelligence, while pursuing China-made production of critical technologies.\n\nOn Tuesday he highlighted China\u2019s progress in technological self-reliance and breakthroughs in areas including computer chips, AI and space exploration.\n\nA series of policy-easing measures announced by Beijing since September, including some property and stock market support, has been viewed as a sign that the Xi administration is shifting focus to stoking domestic demand.\n\nReflecting those changes, the World Bank last week revised its forecast for China\u2019s GDP growth next year upwards by 0.4 percentage points to 4.5 per cent.\n\nHowever, China has this year been rocked by a series of mass killings and stabbings that some experts have blamed on rising social strains.\u00a0Fan Weiqiu, a 62-year-old man, was last week sentenced to death after being found guilty of driving his car into a crowd in Zhuhai, southern China, in November, leaving at least 35 people dead, the country\u2019s worst mass killing in a decade.\n\nAhead of a series of national holidays Beijing has started to urge local governments to expand the delivery of seasonal cash handouts to people facing economic hardship, including unemployed youth.\n\nKelvin Lam, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said while the handouts would not have a significant impact on the broader economy they might shore up social stability and consumption in poorer rural areas.\n\nChina\u2019s economic outlook has been further weakened by strained relations with the US.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, the US has restricted China\u2019s access to computer chips, clamped down on Chinese investment into the US and ramped up sanctions on Chinese companies for trading with Russia in the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Xi told Russian leader Vladimir Putin that \u201cstrategic co-ordination\u201d between China and Russia continued to reach higher levels under their leadership, according to a new year message reported by Xinhua, the state news agency.\n\nAdditional reporting by Wenjie Ding in Beijing, Cheng Leng in Hong Kong and Kathrin Hille in Taipei\n\n\n\n", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f3f4327d-7733-4e84-b88d-9fa34ac8e163"}, {"uuid4": "d7ef3bf1-9f38-4791-992c-2b0e9613444f", "title": "Philippines wrestles with how to face down China while policing 7,000 islands", "description": "Manila does not have maritime resources to go toe to toe with Beijing, say government officials", "author": "Kathrin Hille", "published_date": "2024-12-31T02:00:24.958Z", "content": "Two years of escalating confrontation in the South China Sea have persuaded the Philippines that going head-on against Beijing is not viable as it tries to police one of the world\u2019s largest maritime territories.\n\nDirect clashes with the Chinese coastguard \u2014 accused of behaving \u201clike Vikings\u201d \u2014 threaten to exhaust Manila\u2019s limited resources, according to Philippine government officials. They said the country had to balance securing its western flank, where China is most active, with the need to safeguard the rest of its maritime interests across 7,000 islands where smuggling and piracy are perennial threats.\n\n\u201cWe cannot go toe to toe with China,\u201d said Jonathan Malaya, assistant director-general in President Ferdinand Marcos Jr\u2019s National Security Council. \u201cWe are not a rising superpower like China who has enormous resources at their disposal, so we have to live with what we have.\u201d\n\nThe government is now employing a mix of diplomacy, drones, new laws and new naval infrastructure to try to protect its maritime rights, said government officials.\n\nThe more measured approach is part of an effort to secure and effectively govern the waters, straits and coastline of the world\u2019s second-largest archipelago. Since Marcos took office in June 2022, he has refocused national security from combating internal insurgents and crime to external defence.\n\nThe Philippines\u2019 fisheries and maritime resources are crucial to the country\u2019s economy. But policing its vast waters strains its coastguard, and the many straits cutting through its territory make it vulnerable to invasion and other foreign military incursions.\n\nThe Marcos government\u2019s pushback against China\u2019s claims over almost the entire South China Sea has attracted the most international attention, as Manila has publicised how Chinese coastguard ships try to assert control in the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone by often violently targeting military or coastguard vessels.\n\nThe clashes were shown most dramatically in June near Manila\u2019s military outpost at Second Thomas Shoal, where Chinese coastguard forces used axes and spears to hack at Philippine boats and a sailor lost a thumb.\n\n\u201cI never expected someone who wants to be a superpower to behave like Vikings,\u201d said Vice-Admiral Alfonso Torres, chief of the Philippine military\u2019s Western Command.\n\nThe Chinese force claimed Philippine vessels had rammed a Chinese coastguard ship during what Beijing called a legitimate law enforcement operation against Philippine boats \u201cillegally trespassing\u201d in Chinese waters.\n\nBut since the two sides reached a temporary deal allowing the Philippines to resupply Second Thomas Shoal with less Chinese disruption, Manila has toned down its transparency strategy.\n\n\u201cThere will be listener fatigue. People will say: \u2018What are these guys doing repeatedly banging their heads against the wall?\u2019\u201d said defence secretary Gilbert Teodoro. \u201cTransparency will still be the principle, but we have to show the world that we strategise our moves.\u201d\n\nIn September, the Philippine coastguard withdrew a ship from Sabina Shoal, another reef in its EEZ after a five-month deployment because its sailors had run out of food and water and the vessel needed repair after being rammed by a Chinese coastguard ship.\n\nChinese maritime militia and coastguard vessels have since massed in large numbers in the area.\n\nBut Philippine officials said Manila had to live with that. \u201cIt is not our territorial sea but the EEZ, so it is more our economic rights that are at stake,\u201d said Malaya. \u201cGiven the limited resources the Philippine government has, we can presently tolerate these things so long as they don\u2019t lead to land reclamation or new island building.\u201d\n\nAndres Centino, chief adviser to Marcos on maritime policy, said the lesson from the Sabina episode was that having an extended physical presence at any isolated land feature was not a sustainable approach.\n\nInstead, he said, the Philippines would increasingly rely on satellites, drones and uncrewed surface vehicles to monitor Chinese activity.\n\nSome of those missions are now conducted by autonomous surface vessels provided by the US. Torres said the Western Command now had three Mantas, small uncrewed boats also known as T-12, and three Devil Rays, 11m-long autonomous speedboats. A group of US soldiers known as Task Force Ayungin are providing additional technical support.\n\nThe new systems were necessary to counter China\u2019s use of various irregular tactics, said Torres.\n\nManila\u2019s new capabilities are part of a modernisation drive aimed at enabling its military to protect the country\u2019s entire maritime domain effectively.\n\nIn November, Marcos signed two laws outlining his country\u2019s maritime zones and archipelagic sea lanes, designating just three sea lanes for international shipping traffic.\n\n\u201cThere are too many entry and exit points, and we do not have the capacity to monitor them all,\u201d said Centino. Including the necessary communication with the International Maritime Organization, Manila expects to have a new, complete regulatory regime in place in about two years.\n\nTo implement it, the Philippines is upgrading runways and piers on some small outlying islands and planning several new naval bases and detachments, including on its Pacific-facing east coast, according to Teodoro.\n\n\u201cIt is not directed towards China,\u201d said Centino.\n\nBut one area where Manila\u2019s capabilities fall short is the Benham Rise, an undersea ridge off the east coast of Luzon which the UN has recognised as an extension of the Philippine continental shelf.\n\nChina has been conducting maritime surveys there, an indication that more friction between the two countries can be expected.", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/db313f2e-1bfb-43b9-8833-9f1cef5b6894"}, {"uuid4": "daabcee7-46e6-47e3-be7b-fb2c430bd20e", "title": "US Treasury says Chinese state-backed actor hacked its computers", "description": "Department describes intrusion as \u2018major cyber security incident\u2019", "author": "Colby Smith", "published_date": "2024-12-30T22:27:29.536Z", "content": "A Chinese state-sponsored actor hacked the US Treasury department through a third-party service provider in a \u201cmajor cyber security incident\u201d, the agency said on Monday.\n\nIn a letter to the Senate banking committee seen by the Financial Times, the Treasury department said it had been informed on December 8 by software company BeyondTrust that a hacker had breached several remote government workstations by obtaining a security key and had in turn gained access to unclassified documents on them.\n\n\u201cBased on available indicators, the incident has been attributed to a China state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIn accordance with Treasury policy, intrusions attributable to an APT are considered a major cyber security incident.\u201d\n\nThe department said it had been working with the FBI and other investigators in the wider intelligence community to determine the impact of the hack.

Investor unease about the country\u2019s fiscal situation has already pushed its 10-year borrowing costs above 3 per cent this year and the additional margin that France pays over benchmark German debt has reached its highest levels since the Eurozone debt crisis.\n\nEarlier this month Moody\u2019s downgraded France\u2019s credit rating following outgoing premier Michel Barnier\u2019s government\u2019s vote of no confidence, citing a \u201cmaterially weaker\u201d economic outlook.\n\nThe falling price of French stocks stands in stark contrast to neighbouring Germany, where a 18.7 per cent gain in the country\u2019s stock market this year has defied the gloom enveloping its domestic economy.\n\nLuxury goods companies, which are a cornerstone of the Cac 40, have struggled as it has become clear that China\u2019s economic recovery from the pandemic has stalled.\n\nThe rise of middle-class Chinese shoppers this century had transformed earnings for luxury goods companies, with consumers flocking to European and Asian capitals alike to buy designer handbags and other goods.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic then supercharged purchases as bored shoppers stuck at home spent furlough payments on accessories and premium alcohol. Profits at companies such as LVMH as well as beauty giant L\u2019Or\u00e9al grew by double digits.\n\nBut Chinese shoppers have reined in their spending on concerns over a potential sharp economic slowdown.

The premier added that it was essential to address \u201cthe pressing issues raised by citizens and businesses\u201d.\n\nAnalysts said the high number of detentions might be linked to the deteriorating finances of local governments, which have suffered plummeting revenues from land sales amid a nationwide property crisis that has also slowed China\u2019s economic growth.\n\n\u201cMy friends are getting squeezed from all sides,\u201d said one top Chinese investor, who claimed some local governments were reviewing residents\u2019 assets in order to target the wealthiest with fines.\n\nThe investor, who declined to be named and was himself forced to pay off a local authority about a decade ago in order to win release from detention, said some areas had turned to \u201clong-range fishing\u201d.\n\n\u201cI accuse you of violations in my region and come and take you and make you pay,\u201d he said, characterising local authorities\u2019 attitudes. \u201cIt\u2019s like a nationwide shakedown.\u201d\n\nAbout half of the 82 listed company-related detentions in 2024 reviewed by the FT involved authorities from another region or an unspecified location.\n\nEugene Weng, a lawyer at Shanghai-based Wintell & Co, said some of his clients had experienced abusive law enforcement by authorities from other areas, adding that such practices were eroding confidence in the business environment.\n\n\u201cThe sense of anxiety has gone beyond imagination,\u201d said Weng. \u201cEntrepreneurs are thinking only about the short term, taking profits as soon as they can instead of investing in their businesses and transferring funds overseas as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThis actually worsens tax revenues and employment,\u201d he added, \u201ccausing local finances to fall into a vicious cycle.\u201d\n\nThe internal report prepared for Guangdong provincial leaders in April, which was later leaked online, said cross-jurisdictional enforcement had ensnared a growing number of local companies.\n\nThe report said that since 2023, almost \u201c10,000 enterprises in the city of Guangzhou had faced law enforcement from other areas, with the vast majority of cases involving private enterprises and a rather clear profit-seeking motive\u201d.\n\nA Beijing-based entrepreneur said the detentions had created a climate of fear among founders. \u201cIt gets scary when you start to know people who\u2019ve been detained,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government needs to do something.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s opaque enforcement system compounds these concerns. Companies said they and the families of detained executives received little information about their cases.\n\nThe board of \u201csmart city\u201d solutions provider Zhejiang Whyis Technology struggled to respond to a demand from securities regulators in March for more information on the detention of chief executive Ye Jianbiao.\n\nIn a filing, the board said that other than a notice from another city\u2019s anti-corruption bureau that Ye was \u201cunder investigation for work-related crimes\u201d, neither it nor Ye\u2019s family had \u201creceived other formal notifications or documents\u201d, nor were they \u201caware of the progress or conclusions of the investigation\u201d.\n\nNine months later, the 51-year-old executive remains under detention. Ye could not be reached for comment. A company representative said they had no further information to provide on Ye\u2019s case and that they would make an announcement as soon as he was released.\n\nSome provinces have begun publicising efforts to protect private companies. Prosecutors in eastern Zhejiang last month revealed that local police had helped foil the abduction of an entrepreneur surnamed Shen by officers from another area.\n\nAfter being abducted from his home, Shen fled from the police while being taken out of the province. Zhejiang police then arrested the two out-of-town officers, who initially claimed they were acting on their superiors\u2019 orders and were eventually imprisoned.\n\nIn some cases, the detained executives ended up in the hands of authorities in areas where they did not appear to have any business.\n\nZhang Jian, 55, has spent more than two decades growing Aima Technology Group into one of China\u2019s largest electric scooter makers. His family\u2019s 73 per cent stake in the group is worth about Rmb19.5bn ($2.67bn), putting them at number 247 on the China \u201crich list\u201d compiled by research group Hurun.\n\nBut in October, Aima announced that Zhang had been detained by an anti-corruption squad from Chengde, a city hundreds of kilometres from his home and the company\u2019s headquarters in Tianjin. Aima does not hold any assets in Chengde, according to public filings.\n\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s about his personal issues but won\u2019t tell us more,\u201d said an Aima manager who asked not to be named.\n\nThe manager said Aima had been able to send Zhang important company documents to sign from detention and that they hoped he would be released soon.\n\n\u201cA lot of the detained chairmen get out in two or three months,\u201d said the manager. \u201cI can\u2019t say how long ours will be in there, but this is the situation in the market.\u201d\n\nData visualisation by Haohsiang Ko", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/de2ca241-847d-4b27-980c-52a19c1deb8b"}, {"uuid4": "60b0372a-d896-4521-9688-18257bab68de", "title": "How America First will transform the world in 2025", "description": "In different ways, the US, Russia and China have all become revisionist powers that are seeking radical change to the status quo", "author": "Gideon Rachman", "published_date": "2024-12-27T18:00:23.334Z", "content": "The inauguration of Donald Trump as president of the US will take place on January 20 \u2014 the same day as the opening of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nSince the end of the cold war, the annual Davos meeting \u2014 which brings together business and political leaders from all over the world \u2014 has become a symbol of elite-driven globalisation.\n\nBut Trump is a sworn enemy of what he calls \u201cglobalism\u201d. Davos-goers promote free trade; Trump says that \u201ctariff\u201d is his favourite word. The WEF hosts innumerable forums about international co-operation; Trump believes in \u201cAmerica First\u201d nationalism.\n\nFor three decades, the world\u2019s major powers broadly embraced the Davos worldview. This was a period when economic interdependence drowned out geopolitical rivalries. Trump, President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir Putin of Russia have all spoken at the World Economic Forum in the past.\n\nBut now, in different ways, the US, China and Russia have all become revisionist powers that are seeking radical change to the current world order.\n\nWhen Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, he sacrificed his country\u2019s economic ties to the west in favour of his vision of Russian grandeur. Xi\u2019s China has become more nationalistic and more menacing in its behaviour towards Taiwan. And Trump is demanding fundamental changes to the international trading system and to America\u2019s relationship with its allies.\n\nIt is not terribly surprising that Russia and China are demanding changes to the world order. Russia is a former superpower that is striving to rebuild its lost influence. China is a rising superpower that wants the world to accommodate its ambitions. It is American revisionism that is both most puzzling and most far-reaching in its consequences.\n\nThe US is still the world\u2019s most powerful country and the world\u2019s largest economy. The dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency and the American alliance system underpins the security of Europe, Asia and the Americas. If the US is serious about fundamentally rethinking its international commitments, then the entire world will have to adapt.\n\nAnd yet that appears to be what is happening. According to John Ikenberry of Princeton University, a leading theorist of international relations, \u201ca revisionist state has arrived on the scene to contest the liberal international order\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. it is the United States. It\u2019s Trump in the Oval Office, the beating heart of the free world.\u201d\n\nAs Ikenberry sees it, Trump is poised to contest \u201calmost every element of the liberal international order \u2014 trade, alliances, migration, multilateralism, solidarity between democracies, human rights\u201d.\n\nAs a result, rather than supporting the international status quo, the US is poised to become the leading disrupter. \u201cEvery talk I\u2019ve ever given on the geopolitical risks that we face in the world started with China and Russia,\u201d says Ivo Daalder of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. \u201cBut the biggest risk is us. It\u2019s America.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s traditional allies are among the countries that feel most threatened by a change in the way that the US exercises its power. Middle-power democracies such as the UK, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Germany and the entire EU have got used to a world in which American markets are open \u2014 and the US provides a security guarantee against threatening authoritarian powers.\n\nBut Trump is promising to impose tariffs on America\u2019s closest allies and has called into question US security guarantees \u2014 including Nato\u2019s Article 5, its mutual-defence clause. On one notorious occasion this year, the president-elect remarked that he would let Russia \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d with Nato countries that failed to meet their spending commitments on defence.\n\nThe threat posed by Trump to allied interests is already leading to agonised debates in some of the countries that he is targeting. When Chrystia Freeland resigned as Canada\u2019s finance minister this month, she accused Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, of failing to recognise the \u201cgrave challenge\u201d posed by America\u2019s \u201caggressive economic nationalism, including a threat of 25 per cent tariffs\u201d. Canada, she suggested, needed to keep its fiscal powder dry to prepare for a \u201ccoming tariff war\u201d.\n\nThe question of whether and how to respond to Trump tariffs is exercising diplomatic minds across the western world. Finding an answer is all the more difficult because Trump\u2019s true intentions remain unclear. Is the former and future president best understood as a dealmaker? Or is he a revolutionary \u2014 intent on blowing up the system, come what may?\n\nThe EU\u2019s initial response will be to hope that Trump\u2019s tariff threats are simply a negotiating tactic \u2014 and that a reasonable deal can be reached, well before an all-out trade war breaks out. But if Trump goes ahead with his threatened tariffs for a prolonged period, Brussels is likely to hit back.\n\nOther American allies such as Britain and Japan may respond differently. The UK government will hope that the Trump administration spares it from tariffs, perhaps because the US has a small trade surplus with the UK. Even if Britain is hit, the depth and importance of the security relationship between London and Washington will make any UK government think very hard before entering a trade war with the US.\n\nJapan, which has a large trade surplus with the US, is a much more obvious potential target for Trump tariffs. But Japanese officials think it unlikely that Tokyo would hit back. Like the British, the Japanese would be very reluctant to do anything that tempted a Trump administration to put American security guarantees on the table \u2014 as Washington\u2019s next chip in a negotiation.\n\nThe need for America\u2019s allies to balance trade priorities and national security reflects the fact that it is not just the global economic order that is under challenge. In Europe and Asia, the established balance of power is also under threat.\n\nWhen it comes to security, Russia and China are the most dangerous revisionists \u2014 because they are the nations that are demanding changes to international borders and adjustments to the global and regional security order.\n\nBoth Putin and Xi clearly see opportunities in the current global situation. In a recent speech to the Brics summit in Russia, Xi hailed the emergence of a new global era, \u201cdefined by turbulence and transformation\u201d. Putin struck a similar note in a speech that he gave in Sochi on November 7, two days after Trump\u2019s election, proclaiming: \u201cBefore our eyes, an entirely new world order is emerging.\u201d\n\nAt times, Putin and Trump sound like they are reading from the same anti-woke hymn sheet. In his Sochi speech, the Russian leader defined his enemy as \u201cliberal and globalist messianism\u201d \u2014 sentiments that Trump could easily have echoed.\n\nBut while Trump believes that the new world order should increase America\u2019s wealth and power, Putin\u2019s central aim is to cut the US down to size. He told his audience in Sochi that \u201cwhat is at stake is the west\u2019s monopoly [of power] which emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union\u201d.\n\nXi also sees the decline of western power as a central and desirable feature of the emerging new world order. The Chinese leader is fond of proclaiming that \u201cthe east is rising while the west is declining\u201d. Both Russia and China are hoping to build up the Brics as a counterweight to the western-dominated G7.\n\nBeyond the generalities, both Putin and Xi have specific territorial demands in mind. In Washington and Brussels, it is now assumed that Russia is determined not just to hang on to the Ukrainian territory it has occupied, but also in effect to end the country\u2019s independence by gaining a veto over Ukraine\u2019s foreign and security policies, as well as setting up a Moscow-friendly government in Kyiv.\n\nWestern officials also note that Putin\u2019s prewar demands extended well beyond Ukraine. In an ultimatum that the Kremlin issued in December 2021, Russian demands included the withdrawal of all Nato forces from the eastern European countries that joined the alliance after the collapse of the Soviet bloc.\n\nThe assumption inside Nato is that the war in Ukraine \u2014 and the immense losses inflicted on Russian forces by the western-backed Ukrainian forces \u2014 will have made Putin even more radical in his thinking. One senior European official says: \u201cWe need to understand that Russia thinks it is already at war with us.\u201d An American counterpart adds that a Russian victory in Ukraine would present a \u201chuge threat\u201d to Nato.\n\nA perceived Russian victory in Ukraine would also resonate around the world, and particularly in China. One obvious possibility is that it would embolden Xi to pursue his own revisionist ambitions in Asia. Professor Steve Tsang of Soas, University of London, argues that Xi believes \u201ctaking Taiwan\u201d is fundamental to his \u201cChina dream\u201d. For Xi, victory in Taiwan would mark \u201cthe advent of China as the pre-eminent power\u201d in the Indo-Pacific and ultimately the world.\n\nBeijing\u2019s position is that Taiwan is internationally recognised as part of the People\u2019s Republic of China. But the island is self-governing and its de facto independence could only be ended by intense Chinese pressure \u2014 or an invasion. In Beijing, Taiwan\u2019s political leadership is portrayed as dangerous separatists. There has been much speculation in America that Xi has told his military to be ready to conquer the island by 2027. The date the Chinese leader himself has spoken of in public is 2050. On the other hand, Xi is now 71 years old. He may be tempted to try to secure his legacy relatively soon.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has said several times that the US is prepared to go to war to defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion, though Trump has made no such commitment. And while the incoming president is surrounded by China hawks, he himself has campaigned as a peace candidate \u2014 and has frequently expressed his admiration for both Xi and Putin.\n\nThe questions about how Trump will interpret his revisionist America First agenda are made even more complex by the fact that he will not be operating in an international vacuum. The US president will also have to respond to the actions and reactions of other foreign powers \u2014 in particular the revisionist leaders in Moscow and Beijing.\n\nGiven all the elements involved, there can be no certainties about how the new world order will evolve, only scenarios. So here are five possibilities.\n\nA new great power bargain: Trump\u2019s transactional nature, his determination to avoid war and his contempt for democratic allies leads the US to strike a new grand bargain with Russia and China. The US tacitly grants Russia and China spheres of influence in their regions. America concentrates on asserting dominance in its own region \u2014 pushing around Mexico and Canada, and seeking to take back the Panama Canal and gain control over Greenland. Trump forces a peace deal on Ukraine without accompanying security guarantees. Sanctions against Russia are relaxed and Putin is welcomed to Thanksgiving dinner at Mar-a-Lago. A possible bargain with China would involve the easing of American tech restrictions and tariffs on Beijing, in return for Chinese purchases of American goods and sweetheart deals in China for US companies such as Tesla. Trump would also signal his lack of interest in fighting to defend Taiwan. US allies in Europe and Asia would be left scrambling to provide for their own defence in a new atmosphere of insecurity.\n\nWar by accident: The western allies have a trade war with each other. Political instability spreads in Europe, with the rise of populist forces sympathetic to both Trump and Putin. A ceasefire is agreed in Ukraine \u2014 but there is widespread fear in Europe that Russia will resume hostilities at some point. Trump himself repeatedly calls into question America\u2019s willingness to defend its allies. China, Russia or North Korea \u2014 or some combination of these powers \u2014 decide to take advantage of western disarray by launching military action in Asia and Europe. But they miscalculate. Asian and European democracies fight back, and eventually the US gets drawn into the conflict, as happened twice in the 20th century.\n\nAnarchy in a leaderless world: The US, China, Russia and the EU avoid direct conflict. But Trump\u2019s America First policies on trade, security and international institutions create a leadership vacuum. Economic growth is depressed across the world by Trump\u2019s trade wars. Civil conflicts in countries such as Sudan and Myanmar intensify. The UN is debilitated by big power rivalry and is powerless to intervene. Instead conflicts are fuelled by competing regional powers that are seeking advantage and resources. More countries such as Haiti slide into violent anarchy. Refugee flows to the west increase. Populist parties, contemptuous of liberal democracy, flourish in an atmosphere of social and economic insecurity.\n\nGlobalisation without America: The US retreats behind tariff walls and leaves the World Trade Organization. Prices rise in America and goods get more shoddy. The rest of the world responds to American autarky by accelerating economic interdependence. The EU ratifies its new trade deal with Latin America and signs new agreements with India and China. Europe also opens its market to Chinese electric vehicles and green tech, in return for the Chinese setting up factories across the EU and restraining Russian aggression against Europe. The global south\u2019s integration with the Chinese economy deepens further and the Brics gain new members and influence. The use of the dollar as the global currency declines.\n\nAmerica First succeeds: Trump\u2019s faith in the irresistible nature of American power is vindicated. Investment is driven to the US, increasing America\u2019s lead in tech and finance. The Europeans and Japanese sharply increase spending on their own defence and this is enough to deter Russian and Chinese aggression. American tariffs dramatically reduce Chinese growth, sending the Chinese system into crisis. The Iranian regime is finally felled by some combination of military, economic and domestic pressure. Trump\u2019s prestige soars at home and abroad. American liberals are cowed into silence and some of Trump\u2019s enemies are jailed. The stock market hits a new high.\n\nThe reality of the next four years is likely to be some strange amalgam of all of the above scenarios, plus several other unforeseen developments. As the Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci, writing during the late 1920s, famously put it: \u201cThe old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.\u201d\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nUS president\u2019s takeover talk was learnt from Putin / From Nicholas Westcott, Professor of Practice in Diplomacy, Department of Politics and International Studies, Soas University of London, London WC1, UK", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d11fa816-0c8f-4c79-abb0-8523dd2ecfe4"}, {"uuid4": "62ba455d-b302-40f9-9736-6b995958bb20", "title": "China launches biggest amphibious assault ship in projection of military power", "description": "Vessel described as \u2018light aircraft carrier\u2019 unveiled a day after test flights of new fighter jet prototypes", "author": "Kathrin Hille", "published_date": "2024-12-27T09:25:28.759Z", "content": "China has launched the world\u2019s largest amphibious assault ship, in the latest demonstration of how Beijing\u2019s industrial capacity is strengthening its military power amid rising geopolitical tensions with the US.\n\nCombining elements of amphibious landing vessels \u2014 which are designed to carry and support an invasion force \u2014 with those of an aircraft carrier, the ship significantly strengthens Beijing\u2019s ability to project power globally. It also adds to China\u2019s capabilities in the event of an invasion of Taiwan.\n\nChinese navy officials christened the ship Sichuan in a ceremony on Friday at the Hudong Shipyard in Shanghai while its dock slowly filled with water, according to Chinese official media reports.\n\nThe launch came a day after test flights of prototypes for a new Chinese fighter jet. According to videos posted online by Chinese internet users, the aircraft were spotted over the north-eastern city of Shenyang and the south-western city of Chengdu on Thursday. The two cities host institutes developing rival projects for a new stealth fighter.\n\nA mock-up of the Chengdu model was on display at China\u2019s twice-yearly Zhuhai air show last month, where China debuted the J-35, its latest stealth fighter.\n\nAlthough the exact specifications of the fighter prototypes remain unclear and it could be years from entering service, the test flights and launch of the amphibious assault ship underscored Beijing\u2019s rapid production of new military hardware. It also comes at a time when capacity bottlenecks have started to constrain the expansion of Washington\u2019s military arsenal.\n\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army started tendering for the design and construction of the new amphibious ship, which is called Type 076, just four years ago. The PLA Navy has three amphibious assault ships, the first of which only entered service in 2021.\n\nThe new class is not only much larger than those of its Type 075 predecessor, and can carry more aircraft or amphibious landing vessels on a lower deck. It is also equipped with an electromagnetic launch system, suggesting large drones and even crewed fighter aircraft can take off from its deck. Traditional amphibious assault ships typically only carry helicopters.\n\nChinese military commentator Song Zhongping has called the new class a \u201clight aircraft carrier\u201d. At 260 metres, it is longer than the America Class, the US Navy\u2019s largest amphibious assault ship, and the Izumo, a Japanese class of helicopter carriers.\n\n\u201cWith this, we are entering the four-carrier era!\u201d said a Chinese military enthusiast who often posts pictures and comments on new PLA weapons systems. The Fujian, the PLA Navy\u2019s third aircraft carrier, is undergoing sea trials after its launch earlier this year.\n\nUS think-tank CSIS estimated in August that China\u2019s new ship would have a displacement of 50,000 tonnes, compared with the America Class\u2019s 45,000. Chinese official reports on Friday put its displacement at \u201cmore than 40,000\u201d tonnes.\n\n\u200bLetter in response to this article:\n\nAmphibious assault ships are \u2018light aircraft carriers\u2019\u00a0/\u00a0From Terence R Murphy, One-time US Navy \u201camphib\u201d Officer, Bethesda, MD, US", "tag": "china?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/147f4b4b-4bcf-41d5-85dc-cca16c4883ec"}, {"uuid4": "a9cf3743-e386-434d-a47a-cecd64e497fe", "title": "Sotheby\u2019s gains Richter, London loses Masterpiece fair", "description": "Galleries test Singapore\u2019s market; Patti Wong sets up advisory business in Hong Kong", "author": "Melanie Gerlis", "published_date": "2023-01-12T05:00:46.376Z", "content": "Sotheby\u2019s starts 2023 with a \u00a320mn bang, in the form of Gerhard Richter\u2019s four metre-wide, two-part \u201cAbstraktes Bild\u201d (1986), which it will offer in London on March 1. The work is being sold from an American collection, which acquired it for $9.7mn in 2007 (\u00a34.7mn), then a record for a Richter abstract.\n\nThe German artist\u2019s prices have continued to rise, with recent records for his Colour Charts, Clouds and Seascapes paintings, though his abstracts are still the most prized internationally \u2014 eight out of 10 of Richter\u2019s priciest works are those, like the Sotheby\u2019s work, made with his trademark squeegee, a tool traditionally used to clean windows.\n\nThese include his top price of \u00a330.4mn ($46.3mn), made for another 1986 work in 2015. \u201cHe is on the top of every auctioneer\u2019s wish list,\u201d says James Sevier, Sotheby\u2019s head of contemporary art for Europe. The work is guaranteed to sell and starts its tour in Miami this weekend.\n\nIn April, Berlin\u2019s Neue Nationalgalerie opens a show of 100 of Richter\u2019s works, while David Zwirner gallery, which recently took over the commercial representation of the 90-year-old artist, promises a solo exhibition in New York in March.\n\nArt market players were surprised by the cancellation of Masterpiece, the mixed-category fair founded in 2010 that had grown to be a welcome addition to London\u2019s summer season of smart events. The UK\u2019s inflationary and post-Brexit environment created a \u201charsh commercial reality\u201d, says chief executive Lucie Kitchener. She cites staffing struggles in the wider hospitality industry and says that, since Brexit, the fair\u2019s European exhibitors had more than halved from 38 in 2018 to 16 last year.\n\nThe fair proved to be one too many for MCH Group, which took full ownership of Masterpiece just five months ago, up from its 67.5 per cent investment in 2017. The company also runs the four Art Basel events, its priority art brand. While MCH specifies only that the 2023 Masterpiece fair has been cancelled, there is no sense that it will come back.\n\nTo Kitchener\u2019s credit, and in a crowded field, Masterpiece did something right. Robert Travers, founder of the 20th-century art gallery Piano Nobile, is one of many longtime exhibitors to praise the fair, particularly its 2022 edition, where \u201cthere was one billionaire after another\u201d, he says. Perhaps for another organiser, there\u2019s a summer opportunity ahead.\n\n\u201cEverybody has flown in for the first time in three years,\u201d enthused Emi Eu, director of Singapore\u2019s STPI gallery at the opening of her city\u2019s newest fair, Art SG, which runs until Sunday. Her international counterparts were also pleased to be among the 160 galleries testing the south-east Asian art market in the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre.\n\nMany had committed to the fair back in 2019, but first logistical and then Covid-related problems delayed its opening, during which time Singapore gained an influx of wealthy inhabitants from Asia\u2019s more Covid-restricted countries, including China.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, Singapore was a net beneficiary of Covid,\u201d notes Nick Simunovic, director of Gagosian in Hong Kong. His gallery\u2019s early sales included two Ocean Chunk series works by Ashley Bickerton, who lived on the Indonesian island of Bali from 1993 until he died last year, to Jakarta\u2019s MACAN Museum. Simunovic and others said they had brought works that were priced \u201cinvitingly\u201d; Javier Per\u00e9s, founder of Peres Projects, confirmed early sales of his more expensively priced works, at around $50,000.\n\nPatti Wong, who recently left Sotheby\u2019s after more than three decades, latterly as its senior international chair, has set up her own art advisory business for Asia\u2019s collectors of art and luxury items. She says the auction business has changed dramatically since the pandemic: \u201cOvernight, Sotheby\u2019s became a digital auction house. Automation is fantastic, but there are certain clients who need more hand-holding.\u201d\n\nWong opens her Hong Kong-based business with Daryl Wickstrom, another Sotheby\u2019s long-timer in Asia who left the company in 2016.\n\nWong notes the growth of Asian buyers beyond the continent in the past 10 years. \u201cBefore the pandemic, half of all the works [that Sotheby\u2019s] offered for more than $5mn were bought or bid for by Asian collectors,\u201d she says. This is part of the thinking behind Wong\u2019s tie-up with the London-based Fine Art Group advisory business, an investor in Patti Wong & Associates. The Fine Art Group also provides \u201caccess to capital\u201d, which Wong says appeals to clients looking for art loans and other forms of financing.\n\nThe Natalia Cola Foundation, set up by the Ukrainian philanthropist in 2019, is organising a charity dinner and auction at London\u2019s Royal Academy of Arts to benefit Kyiv\u2019s National Academy of Arts of Ukraine (NAAU). Since Russia\u2019s devastating invasion last year, the museum has lost most of its local support, the foundation and museum say.\n\nThe fundraiser will go towards necessary repairs to the building and will directly support Ukrainian artists. \u201cRussia\u2019s policies and atrocities intend to eradicate Ukrainian identity and it is more important than ever to preserve Ukrainian art and culture in all its forms,\u201d Cola says.\n\nThe live auction on January 28 will have nine works, with another 25 offered in a silent auction that opened this week. Artists who have donated work include Tracey Emin and Antony Gormley, while Juergen Teller has given a photograph taken while he was in Ukraine, \u201cKiev No 1\u201d (2007), with a starting bid of \u00a310,000.\n\nThe country\u2019s own artists Boris Mikhailov and Pavlo Makov \u2014 the latter represented Ukraine at last year\u2019s Venice Biennale \u2014 also feature.

The company, which supplies global brands from Nestl\u00e9 to Unilever, also counts Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi and Singaporean state investment company Temasek as its backers.\n\nThe initial public offering comes as Saudi Arabia is looking to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels into sectors including agriculture.\n\nClimate change and the war in Ukraine are set to keep food prices at higher levels than before the Covid-19 pandemic, even as wholesale food costs have stabilised in recent months.\n\nChief executive Sunny Verghese on Tuesday said investors were increasingly concerned about global food security. \u201cWhat the Russia-Ukraine war has brought into sharp relief is that as the world balkanizes and polarises\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009global output including food and feed production, can get upended,\u201d he said.\n\nOlam Agri is a supplier and processor that links farmers \u2014 particularly from frontier and emerging markets in Asia and Africa \u2014 with global brands.\n\nThe listing is part of a reorganisation of the Singapore-listed Olam Group to split into three new entities. Verghese said there was no change to the plan to list its food ingredients business on the London Stock Exchange with a secondary listing in Singapore. The executive said it would happen after the Olam Agri listing was completed and when market conditions improved.\n\nNirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer and internet research at Aletheia Capital, said: \u201cEfforts to spin off [the Olam Agri] business ticks boxes in a world where people [are] valuing food security and high environmental, social and governance standards.\u201d\n\nThe company is \u201cviewed as proxy for commodity or food prices going up,\u201d he said, though he added that a number of global investors were not set up to trade in the Saudi stock market.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis have been investing in the business for a while, and it fits into the government\u2019s plans to diversify and get exposure to businesses that are ESG-friendly but also serve its specific interests,\u201d he said.\n\nIn response to questions about why it was pursuing a primary listing in Saudi Arabia as well as Singapore, Verghese said the Saudi exchange raised a lot of money in 2021 and 2022, making it an exception to other global equity markets last year.\n\n\u201cAs the first foreign company to list there, we can tap into this additional incremental discrete pool of new capital,\u201d he said.", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1e0733a9-9da9-4d35-a343-0e2770023966"}, {"uuid4": "f454495b-e77a-44aa-b2d1-843e460d81b2", "title": "Alphabet\u2019s Verily seeks to eradicate dengue in Singapore", "description": "Bid to extend tech throughout city state to wipe out disease-carrying mosquito population ", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2023-01-08T00:15:25.564Z", "content": "Singapore could become the first dengue-free country in the tropics, according to Alphabet\u2019s life sciences unit Verily \u2014 if the government decides to use its technology across the city state to tackle the mosquito-borne disease.\n\nDengue claims 300mn victims each year, with 90mn serious cases and tens of thousands of deaths, the majority being children. In Singapore, cases have surged this year, with the average weekly number as of early December being 20 per cent higher than normal, according to the National Environment Agency.\n\nBut in some residential neighbourhoods where the NEA and Verily have run field trials, it is a different story. Verily\u2019s tech fights dengue-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the release of other facility-bred Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. The NEA has reported up to 98 per cent suppression of the Aedes aegypti population and an 88 per cent reduction in dengue cases after at least one year of releases under Project Wolbachia, which Verily joined in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe could make Singapore the first dengue-free country in the tropics,\u201d said Linus Upson, who leads Verily\u2019s Debug Project out of California and previously worked at Google. \u201cWe are making sure our [island-wide] proposal is scientifically and economically sound\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and will make a proposal to [the Singapore government] in the next couple of months.\u201d\n\nProjects to sterilise insects have been around for decades and Verily has trialled the technology elsewhere, such as in California, but high density Singapore is seen as a particularly ambitious opportunity to test a whole country.\n\nCompanies, including resorts and hotels in hot, tropical locations could eventually be customers of the tech \u2014 though concerns remain about environmental impact, with the insects being pollinators that affect plant growth. There are also doubts over whether poorer governments in south-east Asia could afford to replicate wealthy Singapore\u2019s project.\n\nAedes aegypti is the primary vector that drives dengue transmission in Singapore and can also carry the yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika viruses.\n\nThe key to eradicating it is using Wolbachia \u2014 common bacteria that occur naturally in 50 per cent of insect species \u2014 for suppression. Verily\u2019s highly automated facility in Singapore and team of scientists, engineers and specialists rear mosquitoes, sort them according to sex and then release males to mate with wild females. Verily\u2019s males have Wolbachia, while wild Aedes aegypti females do not, making them incompatible. The females lay eggs, but they never hatch.\n\n\u201cThe concept is quite interesting because they are adding to the overall number of mosquitoes to bring the population down. It has worked here and other places though we need to work out if the overall benefit is worth the environmental impact and the cost,\u201d said one science professor based in the city state, asking to speak anonymously because it is a government project.\n\nOther projects that do not focus on suppression have also had success. The World Mosquito Program, working in 12 countries from Australia to Brazil and Fiji, rears and releases Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes weekly over a period of up to 20 weeks. After one year, the wild population of the target area becomes infected, with the bacteria able to block the replication of viruses including dengue.\n\n\u201cWe effectively immunise them,\u201d said Cameron Simmons, the World Mosquito Program\u2019s director of global implementation and director of the Institute of Vector-Borne Diseases at Monash University. There were not more or fewer mosquitoes with the WMP method, he said. It also did not need to be repeated and did not require huge industrial and automated facilities.\n\nWMP\u2019s trial in Yogyakarta in Indonesia showed a 77 per cent reduction in dengue cases and an 86 per cent reduction in dengue hospitalisations in Wolbachia-treated areas compared with untreated areas.\n\n\u201cHigh-income countries such as Singapore or states in the US can afford the male mosquito method used by Verily. But in cities such as Jakarta, Bangkok or Ho Chi Minh, both the mosquito and human population are much higher, making it more difficult and expensive. [That technology] has not been proven at scale,\u201d Simmons added. \u201cWe don\u2019t\u00a0solve the problem of people being bitten. The mosquitoes are still there, but we solve the health problem.\u201d\n\nProponents argue that suppression techniques are still cheaper than the public health cost over the long term. Research by the NEA put the economic impact of dengue at between $1bn to $2.2bn between 2010 and 2020.\n\nUpson agreed there was an environmental impact to any interference but said the problem of invasive species of mosquito such as aedes aegypti \u2014 which is not native to south-east Asia \u2014 had become ever more serious for governments and health systems.\n\nThe cost of Verily\u2019s programme in Singapore \u201cwould be less than the direct healthcare costs of dengue\u201d, he argued.", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9ee5a38f-9f5e-4434-89ec-309f6d2513ca"}, {"uuid4": "a00d9d69-af5e-4d13-8a07-21eade4a3e87", "title": "\u2018Museums aren\u2019t the be-all\u2019: inside Singapore\u2019s independent art scene", "description": "State funding made Singapore a market hub, but it\u2019s the self-starting galleries which bring it to life", "author": "Naima Morelli", "published_date": "2023-01-05T00:01:25.114Z", "content": "In Singapore, the state has invested heavily in the arts. Although this has been a boon to local artists in many ways, it has mostly involved support for museum institutions and large-scale events such as fairs and biennales.\n\n\u201cIn Singapore, the state is always a participant, either as an invisible co-curator or co-commissioner or as a more active agent,\u201d says Singaporean artist Jason Wee, founder of independent outfit Grey Projects. \u201cWhat is sorely lacking are small- and medium-sized spaces, where artists, curators, and directors can develop projects and relationships under different conditions.\u201d\n\nGrey Projects is one of a handful of spaces challenging the bureaucratic matrix of the city\u2019s state-led art scene. \u201cMuseums aren\u2019t the be-all space of art,\u201d says Wee.\n\nStarch established itself in 2021 as a flexible gallery that would adapt and morph depending on artists\u2019 needs. \u201cWhen I was offered a large space,\u201d says founder Moses Tan, \u201cthe original idea was to first commit to a one-year programme, with each month given to artists to experiment or workshop in or to put up an exhibition.\u201d This has carried on for a second year and there are no plans to stop.\n\nTan, an artist himself, was inspired by spaces such as Supernormal in Singapore, Hidden Space in Hong Kong, Speedy Grandma in Bangkok and some artist-run initiatives in Australia. He has also collaborated with Grey Projects on programming around queer art. But instead of following the blueprint of other galleries, Tan tried to understand their ethos and the part they played in the bigger art system. \u201cIt led me to consider how I could also contribute to an organic framework with Starch, to hopefully support the arts with kindness and flexibility,\u201d he says.\n\nOne project Tan is particularly proud of is Inheritance of Parts, a 2021 installation-based group show inspired by Kuo Pao Kun\u2019s play Descendants of the Eunuch Admiral. He says the show was \u201cmaximalist while thoughtful in its considerations of display and performance\u201d.\n\nThis year\u2019s art week is a busy one. The space will host a show titled Nighthawks, curated by artist Jeremy Sharma, made up of works on the theme of \u201cexpanded cinema\u201d, which is part of a collaboration with nearby design studio Supper House. Starch will also be participating in talks and performances.\n\nstarch.sg\n\nIndependent non-profit space Seed aims to push the boundaries of art from south-east Asia. It was founded in 2019 by Ivy Lam, Lourdes Samson and Connie Wong, all graduates of the MA course in Asian art history at the Lasalle College of the Arts in Singapore. Wong cites London-based Parasol Unit and Hong Kong\u2019s Para Site as among the trio\u2019s inspiration.\n\n\u201cWe are seeding new ideas, new artistic approaches and new audiences, allowing the platform to be more open to different art projects,\u201d says Samson. An exhibition which shaped the direction of the space was Work in Progress: Video Art from Southeast Asia. \u201cThis was one of the few shows in Singapore that featured video as an important medium used by south-east Asian artists.\u201d\n\nLocated in a gallery in the River Valley area (until February, when its lease expires and it will have to move), Seed has occasionally expanded into larger exhibition venues on a project basis, including Gillman Barracks, Tanjong Pagar Distripark and The Substation. \u201cWe realise that Seed is not specific to a location,\u201d says Lam.\n\nFrom January 8 to February 4, Seed will present The Garden by Singapore artist Ernest Chan \u2014 who was the first artist to exhibit in the space, back in 2019 \u2014 and will feature paintings, drawings and ceramic sculptures reflecting on the connections between humans and nature.\n\nseedartspace.com\n\nOver its 15 years, the artist-run Grey Projects has grown to encompass two galleries, a library, a studio and a residency apartment. The residency programme has given Grey Projects a reputation for research-led international artistic exchanges, as well as experimental curatorship.\n\nWee, who was inspired by earlier Singaporean artist-run experiments such as Plastique Kinetic Worms and Lee Wen\u2019s Independent Archive, founded Grey Projects as a home for nonconformist art, including queer art, when the field was ostracised in Singapore. Today it has expanded to encompass a variety of artists, including performance artist Amanda Heng, who recently had a show there exploring interpersonal communication in urban environments.\n\nDuring Singapore Art Week Grey Projects will be showing the sound and video works of Seo Hye-Soon as part of a partnership with MMCA Seoul. It is also about to launch the next edition of Walk Walk Don\u2019t Run, its open-studio art tours.\n\nAt the end of July, Wee will take a break from public programming in Singapore, saying that \u201cit\u2019s time to make space for others\u201d.\u00a0He also has a multiyear project of his own to focus on. \u201cI am an artist and a writer in the end,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the end of Grey Projects yet, we have a few more projects down the line.\u201d\n\ngreyprojects.org", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/483da502-ccf0-4eb7-b51b-82e0399097a7"}, {"uuid4": "81334634-8d94-4b86-99c6-d38ea3dc8ffd", "title": "Gallerist Richard Koh: \u2018Younger buyers are coming in \u2014 the idea of collecting is different\u2019", "description": "He has seen Singapore evolve into a livelier art centre through the pandemic, even if there are still limits to what you can say ", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2023-01-05T00:01:25.037Z", "content": "Richard Koh emerged from the pandemic with a realisation: the world had changed and so had he. With that guiding him, the south-east Asian gallerist started making some changes in his own life. First he shook up his stable of represented artists, cutting the number from more than 20 by nearly half.\n\n\u201cIt lifted a lot of weight off. If someone claims to have not been damaged even in whatever small way during the pandemic then I don\u2019t think they are human,\u201d he says over tea in Singapore. \u201cIt is the same with the art world: if they haven\u2019t changed, it is going to be tough. We are working with artists with interesting things to say.\u201d\n\nIt is fitting then that Art SG, the biggest art fair to launch in Asia Pacific in a decade, is in Singapore. Koh says the city-state is itself transformed after the pandemic: it became a hub for summits, conferences and exhibitions as Hong Kong remained shut with crippling pandemic restrictions, to the point where there is a buzz in Singapore that did not exist before the crisis.\n\nThat buzz has flowed through to broader south-east Asia, Koh\u2019s home and a region of 675mn with Singapore nestled in the centre. New buyers, new artists and new buying patterns are emerging. All of this, he hopes, will be on display at Art SG. His gallery, Richard Koh Fine Art, will join 150 others at the major new art fair, which was delayed for nearly four years because of the pandemic. The show was postponed in 2019 to 2020 after participants requested more time, then the pandemic struck and its debut was delayed three more times.\n\nThe 57-year-old, a longtime supporter and promoter of south-east Asian contemporary art, says another change has been a shift towards localisation. Art buyers and collectors, unable to fly to international art fairs while the pandemic raged, started looking more deeply at local artists, especially in Vietnam and Thailand, he says.\n\n\u201cCovid, the war [in Ukraine], geopolitical tensions between the US and China\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009under the facade there is a sense now that local is better,\u201d he says. \u201cYounger buyers in the region are coming in. The buying pattern is different. The visual language appreciation is different. The idea of collecting is different. They are collecting their time. Many of these buyers are from a social media generation, drawn to visual work that is fast, colourful and even virtual.\u201d For this reason, he is hopeful Art SG will steer clear of being another generic international fair and that gallerists showcase more homegrown and regional art.\n\nBut art is an expensive business and south-east Asia\u2019s developing economies often cannot afford to build the infrastructure and programmes needed to foster and promote local art, Koh says. This is part of what has driven his new artist residency programme, scheduled to start in the second quarter of 2023 and run for three months. The course will focus on cultivating new artistic talent in south-east Asia \u2014 applicants have to have been practising for less than five years \u2014 and giving them the bonus of more practical experience in the running of a gallery so they understand how it works when dealing with their own galleries. \u201cAt the moment they don\u2019t teach this in art school and no one talks about it because selling seems to be a bad word,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe project is self-funded and will run for three years, after which he hopes to attract sponsors. Having fairs such as Art SG that then promote these artists\u2019 work, and carry on the momentum, is crucial, he says. Sotheby\u2019s first sale of Modern and contemporary art in Singapore in August 2022 made S$24.5mn (US$18mn), with \u201cstrong results\u201d, according to the auction house, for south-east Asian art.\n\nArtists from the Indochina region \u2014 which includes Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam \u2014 will feature heavily in Koh\u2019s selection. \u201cUnderdog\u201d isn\u2019t the correct word, Koh insists, but he says he does gravitate towards artists who are not considered trendy and don\u2019t have a huge platform.\n\nOne of the regional artists Koh champions is Natee Utarit, who he has worked with for 20 years. A painter from Bangkok, Utarit\u2019s latest body of work considers the question of what would happen if history was written by the east and not the west. \u201cA lot of western curators when they see the work, they think this is about religion. But if you understand the Asian psyche, you see a lot of the quirky things in the painting.\u201d One painting in the D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu series shows men in Buddhist robes in a historic Greco-Roman building.\n\nAnother artist he thinks local collectors will appreciate is Vietnamese-American Trong Gia Nguyen, who is based in Brussels. Koh, who describes his personal preference for art as \u201ccontemplative\u201d, says Nguyen\u2019s work is political in a \u201cquiet way\u201d. His work at Art SG considers the concept of displacement, using both photography and painting. \u201cIndochina citizens are everywhere from the US to France but often never fully accepted or integrated. The work subtly considers the feeling of being displaced.\u201d\n\nVietnam in particular has many more collectors supporting local works, more galleries opening and artists practising full time, according to Koh. Another work he will feature at Art SG is an installation by Vietnamese feminist artist Cam Xanh. The work involves a giant acrylic cross and bible with phrases sandwiched between the bonded layers, referring to the burdens put on women.\n\nKoh admits that any social commentary, even through art, can be a risk in south-east Asia, a region known for authoritarian regimes and frequent clampdowns on dissenting voices. Singapore, where people require a permit to protest and sex between men was only decriminalised in 2022, has its human rights critics.\n\nStill, he is optimistic about the change wrought by the pandemic. In some ways the crisis changed life \u2014 and art \u2014 for the better, including in south-east Asia. \u201cThe good thing from this is that people looked inwards. It was a time of self-discovery. Does it move on further, deeper? I don\u2019t know, but we have had time to understand ourselves better.\u201d\n\nrkfineart.com", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/31da4f37-60b7-4fbd-9b89-4ee6b7b36626"}, {"uuid4": "0b887a71-dab0-443f-b20e-fe1bf07424bc", "title": "New Art SG fair reinforces Singapore\u2019s growing art-world influence", "description": "It has long trailed Hong Kong as an art-market centre but the city-state is riding a favourable wave", "author": "Melanie Gerlis", "published_date": "2023-01-05T00:01:24.938Z", "content": "Singapore has long played second fiddle to Hong Kong as an art-market hub in Asia. But next week a new fair, Art SG, opens in a fresh attempt to establish a major event in Singapore and cement its rising influence in the continent\u2019s shifting art scene.\n\nSingapore\u2019s role as an international art market centre didn\u2019t seem to stand a chance against Hong Kong in 2011, when Art Basel announced it was acquiring ArtHK, launched four years earlier by Magnus Renfrew, who has co-founded Art SG. The relative ease of doing business in Hong Kong and the power of the Art Basel brand limited the prospects for Singapore\u2019s fledgling rival fair, Art Stage Singapore. This began in 2011, ran relatively well despite some internal wranglings, then ended abruptly in 2019.\n\nSingapore\u2019s time may now be coming. It has maintained its status as a haven for private wealth, particularly drawing mainland Chinese money, and as the hub market for south-east Asia\u2019s many growing economies, including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. The geopolitical backdrop, Renfrew says, has since enhanced Singapore\u2019s prospects.\n\n\u201cYou could say that [Art Stage] was too early. Historically, Singapore\u2019s distance from China and its collectors was seen as a disadvantage; now it is regarded as the only neutral territory in Asia,\u201d Renfrew says. \u201cSingapore has had consistently positive relations with both China and the USA and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009has been the de facto hub where constituencies from around the region can meet on equal terms.\u201d\n\nThe new fair\u2019s director is Shuyin Yang, who previously ran Art Central, a Hong Kong satellite fair. Yang, a Singapore native, notes too that, since the pandemic started, the city-state, which opened its borders relatively quickly after a strict lockdown, has witnessed an influx of wealthy individuals from China and Indonesia, particularly from the technology and financial sectors. It\u2019s helpful that Mandarin is commonly spoken in Singapore. \u201cPeople thought they were sheltering temporarily during Covid, but have stayed and helped to revitalise the city,\u201d she says.\n\nRenfrew acknowledges the growing importance of other Asian cities, notably those with strong local support, such as Seoul, where Frieze opened a fair this year, as well as Taipei and Tokyo, where he also runs fairs: Taipei Dangdai and the forthcoming Tokyo Gendai.\n\nSingapore\u2019s cultural scene is more mature than Hong Kong\u2019s was in 2007 \u2014 the Singapore Art Museum and the vast National Gallery Singapore are just two of its respected and well-visited institutions. The commercial sector has been more stop-start and now has less of the marked support and influence of Singapore\u2019s government. But Yang says galleries are regaining momentum since the pandemic and are focused in two areas \u2014 Gillman Barracks and the Tanjong Pagar district around the Singapore Art Museum. In August, Sotheby\u2019s held its first Modern and contemporary art auction in Singapore, citing a \u201cgrowing collector base in the region\u201d, making a total S$24.4mn (about US$18mn), with more sales planned for this year.\n\nThere are no official stipulations on the sort of works that can be shown, with Singapore\u2019s authorities generally less strict than those in China when it comes to politically motivated art. \u201cSingapore is a multicultural and multiracial society with a thriving contemporary art scene,\u201d says Renfrew. \u201cWe have highlighted to participating galleries that it is important to keep in mind cultural sensitivities, with similar considerations to exhibiting elsewhere in Asia.\u201d These sensitivities include\u00a0nudity and profanity, according to local art-market figures.\n\nThe cultural winds might be in Singapore\u2019s favour, but Art SG\u2019s opening has faced turbulence. The fair\u2019s launch was originally announced in 2018 as one of the regional fairs in a new portfolio established by MCH, the owner of Art Basel. A few months later, MCH pulled out of these events, so Renfrew stepped in to join co-owners Sandy Angus and Tim Etchells. MCH Group then reinvested in the fair (it now owns 15 per cent), seemingly hedging its bets in Asia, though its management has described its investment as \u201cadditive\u201d to Hong Kong rather than an alternative.\n\nArt SG\u2019s inaugural event was planned for November 2019 but participating galleries then reportedly asked for more time to prepare, so the fair was pushed back to January 2020 \u2014 then Covid struck. Such pent-up planning might partly account for the 2023 fair\u2019s impressive roster of more than 150 galleries. Many are international \u2014 including the likes of Gagosian, White Cube and David Zwirner \u2014 while 20 galleries with spaces in Singapore are in the mix, such as homegrown heavyweights Yavuz Gallery and STPI.\n\n\u201cIt is bittersweet that so many people have moved from China to Singapore, but it has become such a hub,\u201d says Rachel Lehmann, co-founder of Lehmann Maupin gallery, which will be showing at Art SG. While some see the government as culturally overbearing, Lehmann finds that \u201cit is a small country with great support. They understand the power of soft culture.\u201d The gallerist, who started her career in Geneva and Lausanne, adds that Singapore \u201creminds me of Switzerland\u201d \u2014 and doesn\u2019t disagree when I mention their similarly friendly tax regimes.\n\nAt Art SG, the gallery\u2019s booth will include work by the British-Malaysian artist Mandy El-Sayegh, the Vietnamese-American Tammy Nguyen and the South Korea-born Lee Bul. Lehmann\u2019s gallery has gone one step further than just showing at the fair and has appointed Ken Tan as a director based in Singapore, though she says there are currently no plans for a formal gallery.\n\nFellow international gallerist Thaddaeus Ropac also brings work by El-Sayegh, as well as new pieces by Alvaro Barrington and Oliver Beer. Showing at a Singapore fair for the first time, he cites the might of its National Gallery as well as \u201ca handful of very well-informed collectors\u201d he already knows there. He is keeping his expectations in check. \u201cIt is an experiment. I doubt Singapore can be the next Hong Kong, those are big shoes to fill, but it is important to build relationships in Asia,\u201d Ropac says.\n\nAt the fair, held in the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre, there will be additional sections for younger galleries \u2014 in business for six years or fewer \u2014 including Capsule from Shanghai and Tabula Rasa (Beijing, London). Bucking the trend away from art backed by non-fungible tokens, the fair has another section, called Reframe, with eight galleries showing digital art in its many forms. \u201cThere was arguably too much euphoric excitement [about NFTs] but the baby\u2019s been thrown out with the bathwater. There is incredible work in digital media,\u201d Renfrew says.\n\nYang says that digital art is also part of her mission \u201cto make sure that the fair suits different interests\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009We are expecting a new audience, many galleries and collectors are coming to Singapore for the first time, we want them all to find areas of engagement.\u201d\n\nThe otherwise measured Renfrew predicts an art scene about to explode. \u201cWe need to be slightly ahead of the curve, a catalyst to make it happen, that\u2019s the role we want to play.\u201d\n\nJanuary 12-15, artsg.com\n\nSingapore Art Week, January 6-15, artweek.sg", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fcf0f351-8493-43f0-8771-037ef60e147e"}, {"uuid4": "b3f88278-6127-4c90-9039-7fa0e74bb4d3", "title": "Myanmar artists highlight history and struggle in Singapore Art Week", "description": "Often working in exile or through symbols, they have to be careful in a post-coup landscape", "author": "Naima Morelli", "published_date": "2023-01-05T00:01:24.898Z", "content": "When Yeo Workshop opens its booth at the Art SG fair in Singapore next week, a painting by Burmese artist and poet Maung Day will hang there, depicting a bucolic backdrop in a delicate style that is at once surrealist, whimsical and naive. But just before the rolling hills and verdant woods is a disquieting element: a dog standing next to a corpse.\n\nCalled \u201cDog Found the Murdered Body of His Master on the Beach\u201d, the acrylic painting illustrates a real-life murder that shook the fishing community in Rakhine state in Myanmar, where Maung Day used to live. The murder was part of the post-coup turmoil of recent years: on February 1 2021, the military seized power, putting an end to the democratic transition started by Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy party. Since then, more than 2,600 people have been killed and 13,000 arrested, according to a domestic human rights organisation.\n\nLike many other murder cases in Myanmar, the culprit behind the murder in Maung Day\u2019s picture has not been found. \u201cThe political instability and ensuing acts of violence have been an everyday reality throughout the country over the past two years,\u201d the artist has said.\n\nPart of a presentation by curator Louis Ho for the Singaporean gallery Yeo Workshop, the artwork highlights the tensions and violence in that region of Myanmar. Singapore Art Week, which includes Art SG, is \u201ca timely platform to reflect on the plight of the Burmese people, especially those poor, rural, minority communities, who are most vulnerable to the violence\u201d, says Ho. And his presentation is not the only one to highlight Burmese artists.\n\nSince elections in Myanmar in 2010 and the 2012 by-election victory of the National League for Democracy party, Burmese art had been on the rise. Private galleries, such as Art Seasons and Yavuz in Singapore and Thavibu gallery in Bangkok, and public museums, notably the National Gallery Singapore, have started exhibiting the work of Burmese artists. A 2013 exhibition organised by the Guggenheim and a 2017 show in Tokyo included many works by Burmese artists and in 2021 the Centre Pompidou in Paris dedicated a large-scale exhibition to the Burmese modernist Bagyi Aung Soe.\n\nBut the coup\u2019s leaders brought growing domestic artistic freedom to a halt, blacklisting anti-coup artists or those who had made pro-democracy work or art dealing with sexuality. This violence added to the oppression of local ethnic and religious groups, including the Rohingya people, the Muslim minority now confined to Rakhine state and victims of a genocide by the military rulers.\n\nArtists within the country never stopped working, but they are under strict censorship and the constant threat of incarceration. Art fairs and art weeks are a good chance to see their works since they have limited possibilities to show within Myanmar or are in exile abroad.\n\nHtein Lin, a prominent painter, performer and activist who has been involved in resistance movements for decades, became a cautionary tale. He was thrown in prison last August, along with his wife Vicky Bowman, the former British ambassador, charged with breaching immigration laws. They were finally released in November in an amnesty of political prisoners.\n\n\u201cIt seems as if news of Htein Lin\u2019s arrest was what jolted the art community in Singapore and south-east Asia [into greater awareness],\u201d says Ho, who also curated Htein Lin\u2019s solo show Another Spring at Richard Koh Fine Art in Singapore in 2022. At Art SG, Koh\u2019s gallery is showcasing pieces by two Myanmar artists, Aung Ko\u2019s \u201cThe Burmese Tiger and English Hunter\u201d and Wah Nu\u2019s cloud paintings.\n\nFor most artists who decided to leave the country after the 2021 coup, the challenge is to highlight the condition in Myanmar and still be subtle enough not to endanger their families back home. That\u2019s why most of the works that will be showcased in shows and on fair booths prefer to address specific issues using symbols and ancient tales.\n\nExamples of this are the pieces at the SEA Focus fair presented by Intersections, a gallery which focuses on contemporary art from Myanmar, Singapore and France founded by Marie-Pierre Mol. She will show \u201cLost Children 1\u201d, a work by Maung Day revisiting the story of how the pied piper led children to disappear \u2014 a pervasive plague in Myanmar \u2014 and \u201cTales (The Kiss)\u201d by Kyaw Htoo Bala, a young Yangon-based artist who studied at the Lasalle College of the Arts. \u201cBala recently opened an art space in Yangon,\u201d says Mol. \u201cI think it\u2019s just amazing that he managed to do this at this time. It shows the resilience of Burmese people.\u201d\n\nBala\u2019s almost monochromatic collage is made with a traditional paper produced only in Shan state and was inspired by the stories his grandfather told him when he was a young boy. As an adult, the artist realised these drew on the history of his family, his neighbourhood and his country. \u201cAt the moment,\u201d says Bala, \u201cI\u2019m creating my own stories based on the events in my life. For instance, a piece I will show in Singapore called \u2018The Kiss\u2019\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009was inspired by lovers who seemed unaffected by the confusing, nasty and oppressive turmoil around them.\u201d\n\nOutside the fair, there are works that indirectly address the deeper roots of the crisis. This is the case with Burmese artist Sawangwongse Yawnghwe, who presented two pieces at the Singapore Biennale\u00a0in 2022, \u201cThe Opium Parallax\u201d and \u201cFootnotes\u201d. These installations explore the history and conditions surrounding the opium trade in and around Myanmar. The first consists of a suspended panel: one side presents a simplified version of the history of the opium trade, the other shows a map of the complex web of relations between drug-dealing and geopolitics.\n\nYawnghwe is a descendant of the Shan royal family, and his grandfather was the first president of the Union of Burma, the party which ruled the country from 1948 to 1962 after independence from Britain. Following his death in prison after the 1962 military coup, Yawnghwe\u2019s family formed the resistance of the Shan State Army, before being forced into exile.\n\nYawnghwe\u2019s artistic practice can\u2019t help but delve into the national history: \u201cIn my work there is always the desire of going back to the roots. But as a Burmese artist my roots have been completely destroyed,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead of being annihilated by this realisation, I look at this as a unique chance for freedom \u2014 a way of getting into new territory of how I define myself and my work as an artist.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4ef750fa-bd0a-4da5-bb4b-e2a5bfadffa5"}, {"uuid4": "4c4d82a5-4617-4808-beba-921eae9c2975", "title": "Emi Eu of STPI is a hometown hero in Singapore", "description": "The gallery is at the forefront of developing artistic paper and printing techniques in south-east Asia", "author": "Adeline Chia", "published_date": "2023-01-05T00:01:24.894Z", "content": "Richard Deacon constructed paper towers inspired by Singapore\u2019s public housing. Rirkrit Tiravanija mashed metal foil on to large paper sheets to make circular \u201ctime portals\u201d. Haegue Yang sprayed rice and spices on to pulp to create textured landscapes.\n\nThe artists created these works during their residencies at STPI Creative Workshop & Gallery in Singapore, a contemporary art gallery that specialises in experimentation in the mediums of print and paper. At STPI, they were supported by an in-house team of master printers and also had access to a state of the art printmaking facility and paper mill.\n\nSTPI has hosted 125 artists since 2002. \u201cSpice paper, cement paper, copper paper\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009We\u2019ve had all kinds,\u201d says Emi Eu, STPI\u2019s Korea-born executive director, who has been at the organisation since 2001. She is credited with building STPI\u2019s critical reputation at home and abroad.\n\nSTPI began as a state-led initiative to kick-start the local arts ecosystem, with training up local master printers as its primary goal. Now it champions innovations in the field of printmaking; owns a commercial gallery that participates in top global art fairs; and runs its own boutique fair. Called SEA Focus, it features contemporary art from south-east Asia and its fifth edition (January 6-15) takes place at portside art cluster Tanjong Pagar Distripark, with offerings from 25 galleries in a flowing, boothless format.\n\nEu had a cosmopolitan upbringing. She lived with her father\u2019s family in Seoul as a child. When she was 13, she moved to New York to live with her mother, a prominent textile historian and embroiderer. After college, through the connection of a family friend, she worked in Venice at the Galleria d\u2019Arte Contini for four years, then studied for a masters degree at New York University in visual arts administration, during which she did an internship in the department of prints and illustrated books at MoMA.\n\nAfter she met her husband, a freelance journalist and restaurant investor, she lived between New York and Singapore, and eventually settled in the city-state in 2000. A year later, she joined STPI as one of three staff in the gallery. What\u2019s the headcount now? \u201cForty-eight. Can you believe it? When I first joined, I was the youngest. Now I look around and I\u2019m the oldest!\u201d She effectively took the reins of STPI when its founder, American printmaker Kenneth Tyler, left a few months after the opening because of operational disagreements. (STPI was formerly known as the Singapore Tyler Print Institute.)\n\nThere is no hard and fast rule by which she selects the artists for the residency, which offers up to five weeks\u2019 stay. First, she gets to know their practice and has to feel confident that they can manage a project with 15 people waiting to receive their instructions. This is why STPI started inviting mid-career artists.\n\nShe is candid about the unevenness of the outcomes in the residency programme, but technical innovation isn\u2019t STPI\u2019s only aim. \u201cMaybe for the south-east Asian artists, some didn\u2019t produce visually groundbreaking work. But for many of them, it was an important starting point. When we began the residency programme in 2002, in Singapore, let alone the region, there were no other residencies,\u201d she says. \u201cSo every project has a meaning.\u201d Besides opening up possibilities for south-east Asian artists, she adds that STPI has helped to create a regional market for mid-range works on paper.\n\nSTPI\u2019s reputation has grown organically. Artists who attended the residency introduced other artists, and collectors and museums took notice. MoMA came to acquire works. In 2013, after seven years of applying for a spot, STPI became the first Singapore gallery to participate in Art Basel; now it is the only one to exhibit in all three of the fair\u2019s locations.\n\nSTPI is able to be ambitious in its programming and where it shows because of hefty government support. Part of the trifecta of flagship visual arts institutions in Singapore, which also includes the Singapore Art Museum and National Gallery Singapore, STPI received S$5.1mn (US$3.8mn) in government grants in the financial year ending March 2022. (Its operating budget for the year was S$8.4mn.)\n\nWhile SEA Focus has been the only art fair in the city during Singapore Art Week for the past four years, after Art Stage Singapore was suddenly cancelled in 2019, this January a new juggernaut is in town: Art SG, with more than 150 galleries, intended to be south-east Asia\u2019s largest fair. Eu thinks they are complementary: \u201cSEA Focus is not a protagonist, we are more behind the scenes, a conduit for the region\u2019s galleries and non-profits. We offer them a platform. Art SG is about connecting galleries to buyers, which is an integral part of any ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThis year, SEA Focus is launching a projects section called Collaborations. One of the presenting artists is Danh Vo, who will be supported by Vitamin Creative Space and M Art Foundation, both from China. The Berlin-based artist will realise a work that explores his passion for gardening.\n\nEu, who has overseen STPI\u2019s transformation, hopes that it continues to grow with the times. \u201cI want it to evolve and not be put in any box,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve done my job to bring STPI to where it is now; the next thing to do is to pave the way for a new chapter.\u201d\n\nstpi.com.sg, seafocus.sg", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d011da7e-343e-4b11-b274-8a3b0cbab3cb"}, {"uuid4": "06bcfb5f-3598-44a1-83bb-f55631040482", "title": "Art fair director Shuyin Yang\u2019s Singapore ", "description": "The woman helming the Garden City\u2019s new ART SG event shares her local haunts \u2014 from a Michelin-starred noodle stall to an Art Deco housing estate", "author": "Shuyin Yang", "published_date": "2022-12-26T05:00:51.315Z", "content": "This article is part of a\u00a0guide\u00a0to Singapore from FT Globetrotter\n\nWhen Singapore is mentioned, what comes to mind are the gleaming skyscrapers of our financial district and the triple towers of Moshe Safdie\u2019s Marina Bay Sands, along with the futuristic-looking lotus of the ArtScience Museum and the flower domes and \u201csupertrees\u201d \u2014 solar-powered vertical gardens \u2014 of Gardens by the Bay, all nestled within a manicured swath of the Singapore Strait.\n\nHowever, the Singapore that I know best is the bustling one of my parents and grandparents, a city of rich heritage and culture whose different areas refer not simply to topographical locations but also to character-filled enclaves of different migratory ethnic and dialect groups \u2014 along with all the accompanying food, culture, vibrant colour and ear-scorching slang.\n\nAny morning in Singapore is immediately made better by a sunrise walk or morning yoga in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the only tropical botanic garden which is a Unesco World Heritage Site. Not only is it a verdant paradise that articulates Singapore\u2019s reputation as a garden-city \u2014 the work carried out here to research and preserve rare tropical flora and fauna native to the region is also incredibly important, not only for Singapore but all of south-east Asia.\n\nOne is truly spoiled for breakfast choices in Singapore, from a plethora of street-food options such as prata (Indian flatbread) and curry in the Thomson district, bak kut teh (a pork-rib broth) along Keppel Road (conveniently located next to the art galleries and warehouses of Tanjong Pagar Distripark), brunch boards and coffee in the smart caf\u00e9s of Dempsey Hill, or if feeling indecisive, an entire smorgasbord of hawker stalls to sample in Tiong Bahru market.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling energetic, I\u2019ll brave the queue for Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle in Crawford Lane. Since the stall received a Michelin star in 2016, the line can grow to astronomical proportions (the longest I\u2019ve waited is two hours), but the al dente noodles and perfect balance of vinegar make this one of the best bak chor mee (minced meat noodles) on the island. Otherwise, I\u2019m always happy to have nasi lemak (fragrant rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaves, usually served with sides such as sambal chilli, fried anchovies, hard-boiled egg or slivers of omelette, and chicken), from its humblest version wrapped in takeaway banana leaves to the elevated plates served at The Coconut Club in its new premises along Beach Road.\n\nWhile in central Singapore, don\u2019t forget to visit the National Gallery Singapore, which houses the world\u2019s largest public collection of south-east Asian art from the mid 19th century to today, showcasing the splendour and tribulations of the region\u2019s colonial and postcolonial history. The museum building is iconic, comprising two national monuments, the City Hall and former Supreme Court, where some of the original fixtures such as the prisoner\u2019s dock and jail cells have been preserved and are now interspersed with the country\u2019s cultural treasures. The experience can be beautifully rounded off by an exquisite lunch at chef Julian Royer\u2019s three-Michelin-star Odette within the same building.\n\nThe east side of Singapore \u2014 the Peranakan (Straits Chinese) district of Joo Chiat and Katong, as well as the East Coast \u2014 is indisputably our most concentrated gastronomic utopia. Not only a feast for the palate with dishes like Katong laksa (noodles in a spicy broth) and a range of Nyonya cuisine, it\u2019s a feast for the eyes too with ornate Peranakan shophouses featuring intricate architectural motifs such as those along Koon Seng Road.\n\nThe Peranakan heritage is an intrinsic part of Singapore\u2019s cultural identity, born from the complex fabric of generations of transcultural and interracial marriages between southern Chinese migrants and indigenous Nusantara people. If a rare invitation to visit a perfectly conserved shophouse or a Peranakan bungalow offers itself \u2014 such as the Edwardian mansion known as the \u201cHall of the Phoenix and Peony\u201d, which is privately owned by a doctor and celebrates the unique late-19th/early 20th-century architecture of the Straits Settlements, while splendidly preserving Peranakan culture within its rooms \u2014 do grab the opportunity with both hands.\n\nWhile in the east, take in Singapore\u2019s version of afternoon tea with a robust cup of teh c (Ceylon tea with evaporated milk) and one of food stall Soon Soon Huat\u2019s deliciously flaky curry puffs. The very same curry puffs are also served in Shangri-La Hotel\u2019s elegant lobby lounge on much fancier china plates, but sans true local atmosphere. It\u2019s no coincidence that a number of Singapore artists, gallerists and curators reside in the east, making for a constant stream of good company and food recommendations.\n\nTowards late afternoon, Singapore\u2019s oldest housing estate Tiong Bahru starts to come to life, with its unique blend of chic caf\u00e9s, vinyl stores, bookshops and galleries mixed in with a hefty dose of old-school charm, thanks to its Streamline Moderne architecture, a late development of the Art Deco movement inspired by technology and modern travel, creating buildings with clean aerodynamic lines. As a young child, I visited my grandmother who lived in one of these walk-up apartments, and some of my earliest memories are of the dark, steep stairwell that suddenly opened up into a large airy balcony with blinding sunlight, against thick white walls designed to keep out the tropical heat, characteristic of Singapore\u2019s prewar colonial buildings.\n\nA great place to catch the Singapore sunset is from the penthouse terrace of 67 Pall Mall, a private members\u2019 wine club that was formerly the residence of movie magnate Runme Shaw. Offering an expansive view over Orchard Road as far as the Singapore Flyer observation wheel, the space intersperses 1920s Shanghai Art Deco with visual elements from the golden age of Asian cinema. As a lightweight, I appreciate the huge selection of over 1,000 wines by the glass, especially the white Burgundies.\n\nOtherwise I might drop into Appetite, a research and development kitchen, record bar and art gallery run by chef Ivan Brehm (who also operates fine-dining restaurant Nouri), to catch their latest talk or art exhibition, as well as one of their exquisite foie-gras-parfait tartines.\n\nDespite the vast array of dining options in Singapore, weekend restaurant-booking is often a competitive sport. Some of the places I enjoy most are those that present innovative recipes but are solidly reminiscent of Asian traditional cooking, such as the Korean-inspired French cuisine at Meta.\n\nFor late-night cocktails, one cannot do better than Jigger and Pony, currently 12th (and the highest-ranked Singapore bar) on The World\u2019s Best Bars list. Owned by Indra Kantono and Gan Guoyi, it has become a mainstay of the creative cocktail scene in Singapore. I asked\u00a0Kantono, who is an expert on Singapore\u2019s after-hours scene, what other venues he personally enjoys. He shared that he is looking forward to the new outpost of Park90, a private members\u2019 wine club at the Regent hotel, now with larger premises at the InterContinental devoted entirely to Italian wines.\n\nWinding down for the night, it\u2019s always a debate whether to go for late-night comfort food such as the guilt-inducing Beach Road\u00a0Scissor Cut\u00a0Curry Rice, murtabak (stuffed flatbread) and the iconic sarbat tea at Bhai Sarbat Teh Tarik (great for ensuring you wake up hangover-free), beef kway teow in the Geylang red-light district or a spot of late-night shopping at Mustafa Centre in Little India. But why choose only one? This is Singapore.\n\nShuyin Yang is Fair Director of ART SG, a new international art fair launching as part of the 11th edition of Singapore Art Week, held from 6 to 15 January 2023 and presenting more than 130 art events across the city.\n\nHow would you spend your perfect day in Singapore?

Numbers have jumped nearly threefold since the coronavirus pandemic began and, according to some estimates, now total as many as 1,500.\n\n\u201cThe large family offices are trying to offer the kind of salary senior wealth professionals at private banks are paid,\u201d said Caroline Lee, a former private banker who manages a Singapore-based single family office for a group of Chinese clients. \u201cA lot [depends] on the individual bankers, but it might appeal to people who feel there is too much politics at a big bank.\u201d\n\nFounders of the family offices often used the structure to secure employment visas and move their families to the city-state, recruitment professionals said. Many of the structures would historically employ family members in important positions, whether or not they had previous experience in asset management.\n\nHowever, since April this year, Singapore-based family offices have been required to hire at least two investment professionals to qualify for tax exemptions. Larger funds must have at least three.\n\nThe rules have created the incentive for a collective hiring spree of thousands of asset management, private wealth management and other banking professionals. This would make it a \u201clot tougher\u201d to find talent, Lee added. \u201cThey must be willing to pay.\u201d\n\nDerrick Tan, who left the Bank of Singapore to start up his own wealth management firm to work with single family offices last year, said \u201cfomo\u201d \u2014 fear of missing out \u2014 was a key driver for creating the offices.\n\n\u201cI was asking many of them the purpose in setting up a family office, and it seemed like 20 or 30 years ago \u2014 when you listed your company because your friend or colleague listed a company,\u201d he said.\n\n\u200b\u200bKher Sheng Lee, Asia head of the Alternative Investment Management Association in Singapore, said he was seeing many more family offices hire from top banks and asset managers. They look for \u201cindividuals with specific investment focus and expertise\u201d, he said.\n\nA Singapore-based investment banking head for a US financial institution said he had lost a number of professionals to family offices. \u201cI know of several other [banks] where they have lost someone senior and that person has gone straight to a family office. We are probably going to see more of them taking whole teams with them.\u201d\n\nBankers and other advisers said that although the family offices were conservative and largely focused on property and publicly listed equities, their risk appetite was likely to rise over time. Increasingly they were expected to behave like hedge funds, one said.\n\nCaught by surprise by the surging numbers of family office funds, Singapore\u2019s government this year tightened the rules, with higher minimum capital and hiring requirements.\n\nTo qualify for tax exemptions and hiring investment professionals, applicants must commit to increasing assets under management to S$20mn (US$15mn) within a two-year period. At least 10 per cent of AUM \u2014 or $10mn, whichever is greater \u2014 must be invested locally, such as in Singaporean equities or start-ups.", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9cde054a-1c9a-4c21-ba3e-3a06e5ce41b3"}, {"uuid4": "b41d42e5-97ca-427b-9659-53636d9137e9", "title": "Is Boris Johnson really the emissary that blockchain needs right now?", "description": "FTX\u2019s ignominious collapse leaves a sector searching for justification", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2022-12-06T12:00:31.807Z", "content": "With FTX in tatters, bitcoin in abeyance and the entire fundament of crypto finance in doubt, the technology of blockchain was badly in want of an image boost.

It felt a fitting location for the event in the same week that Singapore\u2019s state-owned fund Temasek was facing scrutiny for ploughing $275mn into the collapsed crypto exchange FTX after eight-months of due diligence failed to flag up any big concerns.

Every sector is entitled to seek the endorsement of disgraced former leaders at times, but Johnson\u2019s paeans of praise for Singapore Slings and his room at the famously expensive Raffles Hotel, delivered alongside his lauding of the potential of blockchain to a half-filled ballroom of men in suits, unsurprisingly was not the panacea for its woes.\n\nOne delegate, who gave his name as Kai and said he worked at a local crypto custodian start-up, was excited that someone \u201cso famous\u201d was speaking. What about Johnson\u2019s position on digital currencies and the potential of blockchain? \u201cOh I don\u2019t know about that,\u201d Kai said with a nervous laugh.\n\nA rare female attendee admitted that she was actually a journalist mainly trying to find out how much Johnson was being paid to headline the conference.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Britain\u2019s former prime minister jovially assured the room of \u201cblockchain pioneers\u201d that they were in the right place, going on to remind his audience that technology is \u201cmorally neutral\u201d. He dwelt at length on how doctors erroneously claimed in the early days of the railways that the rattling and jolting of trains was likely to cause sexual excitement, why the City of London is \u201cthe most productive place on Earth\u201d, and something unclear about nuclear-powered vacuum cleaners. But it was not obvious how these digressions would bolster his case for blockchain.\n\nHe did eventually circle back to the technology and cryptocurrencies. He said he has \u201cseen some pretty shocking headlines about this whole venture and we need some way of holding people to account\u201d. But no sooner had he raised the subject of recent events in the cryptosphere than he moved swiftly on to topics closer to his heart: Brexit, the Ukraine war and green technology.\n\nThen came his finale. \u201cI will make a strong argument that the UK will become even more attractive as a place to invest once we deliver on all that Brexit stuff.\u201d On blockchain, he added, he could not comment further without more details.\n\nThe blockchain enthusiasts seemed less than enthused. Someone showed enough interest to snap a photo only to be admonished by a man who rushed over hissing there was to be no photography.\n\nThe interviewer tried valiantly to bring Johnson back to blockchain. What was his overall message for innovators in the industry? \u201cApart from Singapore, which is a fantastic place for innovation, come to London. Come to the UK\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It\u2019s a fantastic country\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it rains more in Rome by the way,\u201d he replied. \u201cI look forward to watching the progress of the blockchain industry with fascination,\u201d he added to bemused applause.\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9643a519-e61f-4cba-aef5-5d7a3add20cb"}, {"uuid4": "2ec54436-dd3b-4a82-9e0c-8e09e2ed5f8b", "title": "Tech start-ups shun Singapore and Hong Kong for US Spacs", "description": "Blank-cheque companies in Asian financial hubs show little results", "author": "Dylan Loh", "published_date": "2022-11-30T23:00:59.513Z", "content": "Singapore and Hong Kong start-ups are sidestepping their home stock exchanges to merge with special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs) in the US, as fundraising vehicles in the Asian financial hubs have yielded little on their exit plans.\n\nInformation from financial data provider Refinitiv shows that at least nine Singapore and Hong Kong companies this year have announced plans to go public with Spacs listed in the US, despite the cities offering a number of these shell companies since the first quarter \u2014 none of which has merged successfully with a target business.\n\nSpacs, also known as blank-cheque companies, provide promising companies with an alternative way of going public. They raise capital through an initial public offering then acquire or merge with an existing business, bringing the target to public markets without having to go through the traditional \u2014 and time-consuming \u2014 process of listing.\n\nThis usually means a more straightforward and quicker path for companies to go public, as Spacs offer the means to skirt an often-arduous vetting process associated with traditional IPOs.\n\nAmerican stock exchanges have received plenty of attention from investors over the high volume of Spac activity generated in the past few years, catching the eye of bourses in Asia that want to ride the wave.\n\nRefinitiv\u2019s data showed that across the Asia-Pacific region, at least 28 Spac deals have been announced in the first nine months of this year worth a total of $23.4bn. However, none of them involved Spacs from the Singapore or Hong Kong exchanges.\n\n\u201cWith Spacs in Singapore and Hong Kong, I think we are a little bit late to the whole overall theme,\u201d said Michael Wu, senior equity analyst at investment research company Morningstar. \u201cThe other implication would be just more generally [that] the IPO in the primary market has been quite challenging over the last year and that will likely persist.\u201d\n\nMany Spac deals have favoured high-flying upstarts in the tech space, with such companies seen as having high growth potential, which naturally excites investors. This segment of business deals boomed in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, as tech companies saw a surge in demand for digital services when people were in lockdown.\n\nSponsors of Spacs \u2014 many of which are venture capital outfits \u2014 typically receive investor support based on their reputation, as backers do not know what target a blank-cheque company will eventually merge with.\n\nBy backing Spacs, investors have the opportunity to buy stakes in lucrative tech start-ups as they go public. One prominent example is the listing of Singapore ride-hailing and food delivery unicorn Grab in December last year. Grab merged with a Nasdaq-listed Spac called Altimeter Growth.\n\nBut as some investors discover, bets on Spacs do not always pay off as handsomely as they would like. Grab\u2019s introduction in the US market via a Spac, for instance, saw its shares dive nearly 21 per cent at the end of trade on the first day. Its market capitalisation was about $34.6bn as trading closed, falling short of the $40bn expected by Altimeter and underlining the risks investors take when betting on big tech names that do not live up to their promise.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine this year has contributed to geopolitical instability, soaring energy and food prices, and monetary tightening by several central banks to rein in inflation. This has been bad news for Spacs, as in times like these investors tend to shy away from the risky bets associated with tech start-ups that grow quickly but, such as Grab, sacrifice steady profits to do so.\n\nRefinitiv\u2019s data showing $23.4bn worth of Spac deals in the Asia-Pacific region in the first three quarters of this year seemed large but was still a 47.6 per cent decline in value from a year ago.\n\nAnish Ailawadi, global head of investment banking practice at analytics company Acuity Knowledge Partners, noted that \u201cthe golden period\u201d for Spac IPOs and mergers \u2014 mainly during the first half of 2021 \u2014 has passed, with flagging interest in the region also reflecting the global scenario.\n\nAilawadi noted as well that the minimum market capitalisation in the US for Spacs is lower than in Hong Kong and Singapore, which have set more stringent benchmarks, leading smaller companies to merge with blank-cheque companies in America.\n\nThe minimum requirement is $127mn for Hong Kong Spacs and $106mn for their Singapore counterparts, compared with a minimum of $50mn for a Nasdaq listing and $100mn for a New York Stock Exchange listing in US.\n\n\u201cValuations in the US are generally higher than in Asian markets. Most private companies prefer US-based Spacs over those from other regions,\u201d Ailawadi told Nikkei Asia. \u201cSimilarly, US-listed companies attract better analyst coverage, which translates into higher institutional investor interest.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hypebeast, a digital media and ecommerce company, announced its plans for Nasdaq in April by signalling its intent to merge with Iron Spark I Spac to the tune of $221.8mn \u2014 the sole player from Hong Kong to do so via a blank-cheque company this year, Refinitiv\u2019s data showed. Hypebeast opted for a dual listing, with its other presence on the Hong Kong bourse.\n\nThe data showed that Singapore had eight counterparts unveil similar Spac plans \u2014 seven on Nasdaq and one on the NYSE. In August, for instance, financial technology platform Seamless Group announced a deal valued at $400mn with an NYSE-listed Spac called InFinT Acquisition.\n\nMore recently, the city-state\u2019s Asia Innovations Group (ASIG), which operates a platform designed for mobile gaming and ecommerce, announced in late September it would combine with NYSE-listed Magnum Opus Acquisition \u2014 a deal representing a total equity valuation of $2.5bn and billed as the largest consumer-internet Spac merger of the year to date.\n\n\u201cThe proposed merger will combine the best of macro growth in emerging markets and the benefits of being a publicly listed company in the US to transform ASIG into a global mobile powerhouse,\u201d said ASIG chief executive Andy Tian. \u201cASIG has built a unique, well-diversified global business in the core verticals of social, games, ecommerce and payments.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Asia\u2019s key financial hubs have been keeping a low profile as America continues to scoop up tech players, even though the fervour for Spacs has cooled.\n\nIn Singapore, after an initial burst of three Spac IPOs in January, the exchange has seen no such further listings in 2022. In Hong Kong, Aquila Acquisition and Vision Deal HK Acquisition are blank-cheque companies that have listed, with more than 10 others reportedly seeking a place on the hub\u2019s bourse.\n\nAs the year draws to a close, investors still have no clear view of what companies will eventually be acquired by these Spacs, if any. Spacs in Singapore must complete a merger or acquisition within 24 months of the IPO date, with an extension of 12 months possible.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Spacs should announce a deal or de-Spac transaction within 24 months, or complete the de-Spac within 36 months, with a six-month extension possible.\n\nPeggy Mak, portfolio manager at fund management outfit Haven Capital, reckoned it is highly possible that some of the Singapore and Hong Kong Spacs could miss the two-year deadline.\n\n\u201cThe global economic environment has clouded all markets, hence Spacs in both markets are not spared,\u201d she told Nikkei. \u201cAs the [deadline] draws near, they might lower their standard for a target, which makes it worse.\u201d\n\nMak stressed that most Spac targets are growth companies that continue to show a negative operating cash flow \u2014 performance that investors are shunning due to rising interest rates and recession risks.\n\n\u201cThe number of Spacs globally might have outpaced the number of companies looking to be listed. There is still the overarching concern about the tech sector and growth companies, hence we do not expect much enthusiasm even with a de-Spac announcement.\u201d\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on November 21 2022. \u00a92022 Nikkei Inc.

In response to queries by the Financial Times, the fund had defended its \u201ceight-month due diligence\u201d process but earlier this month admitted its trust in former chief executive Bankman-Fried appeared \u201cmisplaced\u201d.\n\nTemasek\u2019s inquiry comes as filings by FTX\u2019s new management in US bankruptcy court point to a severe lack of financial controls at a group that was once valued at $32bn by a roster of big-name investors that also includes venture capital firm Sequoia and Japan\u2019s SoftBank.\n\nConfidence in Singapore\u2019s ability to regulate the digital assets industry has been undermined by a series of crypto failures connected to the city-state this year, including the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto platform Hodlnaut. Singaporean police said last week it was investigating the platform and its directors \u201cfor possible cheating and fraud offences\u201d.\n\nThe city-state\u2019s sovereign wealth fund GIC is also facing pressure as an investor of crypto broker Genesis. Genesis said following FTX\u2019s collapse earlier this month that it had about $175mn in funds locked in an account on the platform. Several days later, Genesis paused withdrawals at its lending unit, citing \u201cunprecedented market turmoil\u201d.\n\nThe fallout over FTX and the losses incurred by retail investors have resulted in unusual public criticism of Temasek, with many questioning its due diligence. Singapore users accounted for the second-largest share of web traffic to FTX.com, accounting for about 5 per cent of traffic share, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\n\u201cIt was a moonshot investment, but Temasek looks silly for pushing the line they did eight months of due diligence. They should have just said we took a punt, it didn\u2019t work out, and we are sorry,\u201d said one major investor in the private equity space.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Saturday, Ho Ching, the former Temasek chief executive who is the wife of Singapore\u2019s leader, Lee Hsien Loong, called the fund\u2019s loss \u201cegg on our face\u201d. But she defended the investor\u2019s overall strategy, saying \u201csome of Temasek\u2019s best investments were made by being contrarian\u201d.\n\nWong, who also serves as Singapore\u2019s finance minister, said on Wednesday in response to questions from members of parliament that FTX\u2019s collapse would have a limited impact on the city-state\u2019s broader financial system.", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/37b4257f-6e42-43eb-a080-74f7b47bfe73"}, {"uuid4": "e44d5986-ce0f-425b-98e7-10cfa180f854", "title": "Chinese companies set up in Singapore to hedge against geopolitical risk", "description": "More businesses are \u2018Singapore-washing\u2019 as US-China relations deteriorate", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2022-11-30T02:57:21.833Z", "content": "As many as 500 Chinese companies have quietly redomiciled or registered in Singapore over the past 12 months in a bid to hedge against rising geopolitical risk as tensions between Beijing and Washington escalate.\n\nThey follow online fast-fashion retailer Shein, electric vehicle maker Nio and IT services provider Cue, who were among the first to switch parent companies or global headquarters to Singapore, list on the stock exchange, acquire local businesses and form joint ventures in the city state.\n\nChinese businesses setting up in Singapore is not a new phenomenon, but senior bankers say there is now an \u201cacute\u201d rush by mainland groups to establish holding companies to future-proof their businesses as the west steps up its scrutiny of corporate China.\n\nThe exact number of Chinese companies being set up is unclear because Singapore does not disclose origin country in its public statistics. However, one lawyer said his firm\u2019s internal research division found more than 500 new Chinese companies had set up this year in Singapore, which experts noted was a rise from previous years.\n\nAnother business advisory group in the city-state that had reviewed the data calculated the number at 400, including family offices, but also asked not to be identified due to the sensitivities involved. Analysts expect the number of family offices \u2014 many of which are from China \u2014 to be well over 1,000 by the end of this year, compared with 400 at the end of 2020.\n\n\u201cChina has a huge domestic market, but increasingly, businesses there work around the world. They know sensitivities arise if they remain Chinese, so they market themselves as international. Singapore, with its strong regulatory system and global reputation, allows that platform,\u201d said Ryan Lin, a director at Singapore\u2019s Bayfront Law. \u201cIf those numbers are correct, it would be a huge step up from previous years.\u201d\n\nSingapore is expected to benefit from the trend as it works to establish itself as a centre for global finance and capital flows. In September, it overtook Hong Kong as Asia\u2019s biggest financial hub and became third overall behind New York and London, according to the Global Financial Centres Index.\n\nThe city-state is also proving to be a better location for networking and dealmaking than China, where border restrictions and rolling coronavirus lockdowns have limited crucial business travel for executives.\n\n\u201cWe call it Singapore-washing, and it definitely helps tick boxes when we present a company to investors if we can say it is domiciled or headquartered or even listed in Singapore,\u201d said an executive at a global private equity firm.\n\nThe trend has accelerated. Shein, a fashion company popular with western consumers, has aggressively expanded its Singapore office this year. Since 2021, it has been operated by Singapore-registered Roadget Business, according to filings first reported by Reuters, which one lawyer specialising in US equity listing rules said \u201ccould make it easier to list in the US\u201d.\n\nNio, the EV start-up that plans to expand into the US market after entering Europe, listed on the Singapore exchange in May this year, despite already being listed in New York and Hong Kong.\n\nThe automaker said the listing was important for its \u201cglobal business development\u201d and an adviser familiar with the deal said the move was partially a hedge to retain access to international finance.\n\nThe flotation came at the same time Nio was put on a list of 80 Chinese companies facing expulsion from US exchanges following a stand-off between Washington and Beijing over accounting practices.\n\nOthers have established parent companies in Singapore. Cue Group was formed through a merger of three Chinese companies in Shanghai in 2017. Shi Kan, Cue\u2019s chief executive, who divides his time between Shanghai and Singapore, said the company was originally founded in Singapore, but most of its 2,000 employees, along with most of its deals, were in mainland China.\n\nShi told the Financial Times its Singapore office was the \u201cgrowth engine\u201d for global expansion. There were only 20 staff members in Singapore as of September, but that would double by the end of the year, he said.\n\nTraditionally, Hong Kong was the choice for many such companies, said Kia Meng Loh, a senior partner at Dentons Rodyk. But with Beijing \u201cflexing its muscles\u201d in the semi-autonomous rival finance hub, Singapore is the obvious next choice, he said.\n\nLoh said he was seeing instances where Chinese companies were forming joint ventures with Singaporean entities, pursuing a merger or buyout, hiring Singaporean management and employees or including Singaporeans on the board.\n\nOne such company is St Louis Medical Devices, a joint venture set up in Singapore in 2020. The shareholders are a US company that specialises in technology to measure blood sugar levels without a needle and its Chinese partner, which injects capital and raises funds. George Chen, managing director of the joint venture, said Singapore was the \u201cgateway to Asia\u201d.\n\nAnti-China sentiment in crucial markets such as India has also created obstacles for some Chinese companies, especially those designing apps for mass consumption. Lawyers and bankers cite instances where Chinese companies had redomiciled in Singapore specifically so they could launch apps in India without the \u201cbaggage\u201d.\n\nSingapore\u2019s government is closely watching the trend to ensure no rules are broken. New regulations from December will require Singaporean entities to record nominee shareholders and identify controlling executives.\n\n\u201cThere is a bright future for Singapore, but it has to be handled properly, and the government here has been taking the right steps to optimise the opportunity for the country,\u201d said Greg Kallinikos, Asia chief executive of StoneX, a Nasdaq-listed international financial services company. Kallinikos said Singapore\u2019s legal system is reassuring to the global investment community.\n\n\u201cThe minute you hear [a company] is Singapore-incorporated, jurisdictionally it gives you a lot of confidence,\u201d he said.", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a0c11e3e-ab72-4b4b-a55c-557191e53938"}, {"uuid4": "7121c0dc-bb1c-4c51-b5cd-6b58a4e6f644", "title": "Singapore is well-positioned to play both sides of decoupling", "description": "The city state has a ringside seat for the shifting investment patterns caused by US-China tensions", "author": "Leo Lewis", "published_date": "2022-11-24T05:00:26.380Z", "content": "When conversations in Singapore turn to souring geopolitics, there are some who cannot resist pointing out the upside. Of course nobody wants a new cold war, assures one former top official. But if such a situation were unavoidable, and blocs started forming more rigidly and confrontationally around a US-China split, Singapore might be better positioned than anyone to play both sides.\n\nYet as companies and investors position themselves for what could well be a difficult 2023, little over the past 10 days has resolved the question of whether the November 14 talks between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping set some sort of floor on deteriorating relations, or whether they will continue falling dangerously as many had projected. The cold war lexicon provides easy filler for the gaps created by all this uncertainty.\n\nLurking behind this ominous shorthand, though, is a more intriguing, Singapore-specific nuance. Even without the risks of a new cold war, the hazards associated with deglobalisation and decoupling merit serious attention from everyone. And Singapore, perhaps sooner than anyone else, appears to have tacitly accepted both as inevitable.\n\nThere are several areas where the signs of this acceptance are already showing. The first, according to people close to Singapore\u2019s two sovereign funds and other large institutional investors, is an acknowledgment that investment criteria have significantly changed. The relative certainties of the globalisation era are eroding fast, confides one. Everything must now be scrutinised through a geopolitical lens and with an assumption that pure economic logic, in a world where companies are forced to second-guess or hedge against geopolitics, may no longer be paramount in corporate decision-making.\n\nBy extension, said one senior fund manager, the investment prospects of individual companies should now be judged by their navigation of distinct spheres. Companies that would once have had to prove broad global growth prospects to make their investment case, they said, can theoretically now reach the same point by demonstrating an ability to grow in either a China sphere or a western one.\n\nSecond, the deglobalisation theme, say Singapore-based investment bank heads, is also making its mark on mergers and acquisitions. Singapore\u2019s increasingly strong position in Asian dealmaking has given its financial services sector a clearer view of how companies are thinking their way into a more decoupled world. Regional dealmaking, predicted one banker, will focus on building resilience in a decoupled world. Globalisation will fade as the central driver in favour of growth within, but not necessarily across, the new lines being drawn by US-China tensions.\n\nA third signal, described by lawyers, is the influx of Chinese capital and the desire by mainland companies to establish themselves as international, Singapore-based entities.\n\nFrom the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2021, the number of family offices based in Singapore surged from 400 to 700. Lawyers dealing with the deluge say that more than half of these are from China and predict that the number could be over 1,500 by the end of this year, amid a huge backlog of unprocessed applications.\n\nAt the same time, Chinese companies are ascribing Singapore a central role in their preparations for a more polarised business environment with less ready access to global capital. A growing number of those that have already felt the pain of decoupling, or can readily envisage it, have initiated processes to redomicile in Singapore. Some are specifically doing it, say lawyers, because their international strategies have been thwarted by geopolitics. Technology companies, their lawyers add, have been the earliest to make the move. Other sectors will surely follow.\n\nSome of the moves have clearly been accelerated by a desire to escape China\u2019s restrictive zero-Covid policies. Others may simply be to do with the protection of family wealth from the uncertainty of existence under Xi. But both the family offices and the redomicilings, say advisers, are symptoms of a growing panic that decoupling is now real, with few options better than Singapore. The wish to make the move there from China, said one lawyer, may have been around for some time; but the need to do so has not been felt until now and it is the decoupling narrative that has caused that change.\n\nSingapore, through luck and judgment, may have made itself the right place at what, for the world at large, is the wrong time.\n\nleo.lewis@ft.com", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/269b1a53-dd66-4446-8da8-f54d39403bfc"}, {"uuid4": "6698dabf-ad24-4e1d-87b5-62cd32391515", "title": "Temasek writes down $275mn \u2018misplaced\u2019 FTX investment", "description": "Loss comes as bankrupt crypto exchange distances itself from founder Sam Bankman-Fried", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2022-11-17T04:49:54.325Z", "content": "Temasek has written off its $275mn stake in cryptocurrency company FTX, with the Singapore state investor saying its trust in former chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried appeared \u201cmisplaced\u201d.\n\nTemasek invested $210mn in FTX International and $65mm in the company\u2019s US subsidiary across two funding rounds.

On chat rooms and blogs, current and former flight attendants offer advice to those preparing for interviews and training. Many discuss the need to stay below a certain body mass index level and detail how their make-up palette and even hairstyles are chosen for them, while others warn that candidates \u2014 who are advised to be \u201chumble\u201d and \u201celegant\u201d \u2014 may be rejected for having a mole on their face.\n\nSingapore Airlines is not the only flag carrier to hire attractive women, of course. But many in the city-state were shocked last month to learn that, up until this year, Singapore Girls were fired when they became pregnant. In October, the airline announced that it had dropped a policy that required female cabin crew to leave the airline after the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nThe change means pregnant cabin crew also receive paid maternity leave for up to 16 weeks before being automatically added to the next flight roster, bringing Singapore Airlines in line with other local employers.\n\nThe company said cabin crew \u201cmay choose to work in a temporary ground attachment\u201d during their pregnancy, although they would have to apply for such roles. \u201cAll eligible cabin crew who have applied for ground positions so far have been offered available positions suitable for their expertise,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cWhen you put all of this together \u2014 the Singapore Girl, the fact they were one of the last global airlines to hire female pilots, the pregnancy rules \u2014 the optics are not great,\u201d said one director at a women\u2019s rights organisation in Singapore.\n\nSingapore Airlines did not provide a reason for the change. Advocacy groups suggest that the airline, which laid off thousands of employees during the pandemic, is desperate to retain staff to meet the rebound in global travel. Changi is one of the world\u2019s busiest airports and a top transfer hub for Asia. Singapore Airlines this month reported a record quarterly operating profit of S$678mn ($493mn).\n\nThe Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware), a non-governmental organisation based in Singapore, said in a statement that it was \u201csurprised\u201d that the carrier had continued the practice of forcing pregnant staff to quit for as long as it did.\n\n\u201cWe can only speculate as to why [the airline] decided to make the change this year,\u201d it said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that because of the pandemic the job market is currently very tight and it makes sense to not terminate employees\u2019 contracts unnecessarily.\u201d\n\nEmployees still have to apply for ground work with no guarantee of securing a position, Aware says. The precise grooming standards remain unclear but may also restrict opportunities for returning mothers, it added.\n\nMaternity discrimination is against the law in Singapore, so the question arises how the government-backed airline was able to enforce the policy until 2022 despite years of criticism. It also casts a pall over state efforts to address workplace discrimination, particularly against women.\n\nResearch carried out by Aware shows that maternity discrimination is still a widespread issue in Singapore and other employers do find ways to get around existing laws. Aware says its workplace harassment and discrimination advisory reported 71 maternity discrimination cases in 2021, out of a total of 88 discrimination cases reported to them that year.\n\nMany hope that forthcoming anti-discrimination legislation \u2014 a first for Singapore \u2014 will be more effective in rooting out such practices by closing loopholes.\n\nMany of the cases examined by Aware are related to small and medium-sized enterprises, not major brands such as Singapore Airlines \u2014 which is why how the carrier treats its female employees is so important. Singapore Airlines should be the sky-high bar other employers are held to, rather than a floor.\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com / @mjruehl", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/eaa9dbb8-5b0a-499d-bdf1-3a877b3f8b6d"}, {"uuid4": "611f9d70-0fb9-4e43-9159-0245a5e27559", "title": "Hong Kong takes on Singapore for Asia\u2019s crypto crown", "description": "City seeks to attract retail investors by shifting towards clear rules", "author": "William Langley", "published_date": "2022-11-08T00:01:21.918Z", "content": "Hong Kong has kicked off a contest to become Asia\u2019s crypto capital as investors and executives warn that rival Singapore may be squandering its head start with its pivot to stricter regulation.\n\nThe sudden shift in Hong Kong last week towards clear rules for retail investors to trade digital assets follows years of ambiguity from regulators. That made some companies reluctant to build up a greater presence in the city, and capitalise on demand from mainland China, where crypto trading is outlawed.\n\n\u201cThis kind of regulation [in Hong Kong], this kind of positive development, I think we have been waiting for [it for] five years,\u201d said Lennix Lai, director of financial markets at OKX, a crypto exchange with offices in Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\n\u201cThe regulatory status of Hong Kong is very important on a global scale\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009industry participants are seeking a proper licence everywhere in the world, but what they really want is a regulatory status in a major financial centre,\u201d Lai added.\n\nThat delay is reflected in the size of Hong Kong\u2019s market in comparison to its great rival, Singapore. With about $74bn, Hong Kong trails Singapore in terms of the value of crypto assets received in the year to the end of June, with the latter\u2019s total coming in at about $100bn, according to Chainalysis, a consultancy.\n\nThe clash between the two financial hubs came to a head last week, when they held overlapping fintech conferences. At their event, Hong Kong officials announced a public consultation on how retail investors could have a suitable degree of access to digital assets under a new licensing regime. Rules at present limit crypto trades to institutional investors with a portfolio of at least HK$8mn (US$1mn).\n\n\u201cI think [Hong Kong] could still regain that [leading global crypto hub] status,\u201d said Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder and chief executive of FTX. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not too late for that.\u201d FTX quit Hong Kong for the Bahamas last year owing to the city\u2019s strict Covid-19 restrictions and more regulatory clarity in the Caribbean.\n\nIn contrast, the Monetary Authority of Singapore proposed to tighten regulations for retail investors, after years of trying to attract some of the biggest names. The \u201ccrypto credit crunch\u201d earlier this year revealed a number of companies with ties to Singapore, such as hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.\n\nRavi Menon, managing director of the MAS, said in a speech at Singapore\u2019s fintech festival last week that the city-state did not want to be a hub for trading and speculating in the asset class. The central bank has proposed barring retail investors from borrowing to invest in cryptocurrencies and requiring crypto exchanges to check that would-be buyers understand the risks.\n\nThe contrasting approaches have already prompted some to change their plans. \u201cWith the recent policy announcements, we will be prioritising and accelerating our business plans in Hong Kong over Singapore. Previously we planned to move our headquarters to Singapore, but now that plan is on pause,\u201d said Adrian Wang, chief executive of Metalpha, a crypto asset management service provider.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s shift comes despite the ban levied on crypto trading in mainland China. \u201cHong Kong seems to be positioning itself as a much more open jurisdiction for crypto trading as compared to Singapore, which is especially interesting in the context of how hard the mainland has cracked down,\u201d said Zennon Kapron, head of fintech consulting firm Kapronasia.\n\nThe city is at pains to emphasise it has a regulatory system that is separate from mainland China. \u201cThe key elements that international investors or people come to Hong Kong for is our international connectivity\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009together with our access to China,\u201d said Hong Kong\u2019s financial services secretary Christopher Hui.\n\nSingapore says it is still \u201cembracing\u201d crypto but focusing on institutional markets.\n\n\u201cWe are embracing fully the underlying technologies of distributed ledgers and the potential that they have to transform financial markets,\u201d said Lawrence Wong, Singapore\u2019s deputy prime minister, as he opened its conference.\n\nAnalysts and industry executives said there would be greater clarity when the two cities published the final versions of their plans. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s regime will be going into effect in March, and there\u2019s plenty of time for Singapore to issue similar guidelines in the first quarter of next year,\u201d said Vince Turcotte, Hong Kong-based director of digital assets at Eventus.\n\nBut Hong Kong\u2019s ambiguity on crypto may have already cost it as the hub of choice for companies and executives.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t look at the Hong Kong announcement as anything more than the whole region waking up to \u2018this is real and here to stay\u2019,\u201d said Brooks Entwistle, a senior vice-president at cryptocurrency company Ripple. \u201cBut Singapore has been open for the last several years, making all the right moves to remain the long-term regional or global headquarters of choice for fintech and crypto organisations.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e90add6d-326e-4898-b8c1-78f98f2d6929"}, {"uuid4": "14864776-8628-4f3a-bb48-ed8cff6f453d", "title": "Increasingly cosmopolitan Singapore clings to conservative values  ", "description": "City-state\u2019s stance appears out of sync with younger generation and international rivals ", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2022-11-02T00:57:59.895Z", "content": "Civil rights activists in Singapore were puzzled when their government issued a challenge to Sir Richard Branson. The UK billionaire entrepreneur was invited last month to take part in a televised debate in response to his blog post criticising the city-state\u2019s strict drug policy and death penalty.\n\nHome affairs and law minister K. Shanmugam\u2019s offer of a plane ticket and accommodation for him to come and argue his position seemed at odds with Singapore\u2019s stance at home. The government had shown a willingness to use the country\u2019s laws and other means to silence local criticism, discourage opposing views and stop behaviours deemed unacceptable, critics said.\n\nWriting on Twitter, Jolovan Wham asked Shanmugam why the minister could not debate the issue with his local community in Singapore instead. In response, Shanmugam blocked Wham on social media and deleted his comment, the activist told the Financial Times.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder that while Singapore continues to embrace western commerce and has shifted on some issues such as gay rights, the island remains politically authoritarian and socially dirigiste.\n\nSingapore is trying to attract global talent in everything from cryptocurrencies to the metaverse, after leaping ahead of Hong Kong in September to become the world\u2019s biggest financial hub behind London and New York.\n\nAs the ruling People\u2019s Action party \u2014 in power since independence in 1965 \u2014 prepares for new leadership, it has redoubled efforts to protect the cultural status quo, according to experts. But its popularity is in decline and its stance ignores the views of a more liberal, younger generation of Singaporeans.\n\nIn October alone, a global fashion magazine has been chided for promoting non-traditional families, a bill has been introduced to amend the constitution to protect the heterosexual definition of marriage, a controversial film has been banned on religious grounds and an adult content creator has been jailed. Unlike Branson, some local activists against the death penalty have been issued with police warnings.\n\n\u201cThe government has always taken an interesting position that even if it is unable to really regulate individual activities, it does feel it needs to state its position on values publicly \u2014 even as a symbolic act,\u201d said Chua Beng Huat, a professor at Yale-NUS college. \u201cThere is a will to govern not just the economy but also social values that are important to political stability.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest moves came a week ago when the government filed bills in parliament to prevent court challenges to laws and policies concerning marriage.\n\nDespite softening attitudes towards homosexuality \u2014 the city decriminalised sex between men in August via the repeal of a colonial-era law \u2014 Singapore has sought to protect itself against court challenges that could legalise gay marriage. The intervention effectively makes this a political issue the PAP can control, rather than a legal one.\n\nA similar sentiment was at play last month when Vogue Singapore saw its licence cut from one year to six months. The fashion magazine was issued a warning by the information ministry over nudity and content that promoted non-traditional families, the ministry said. Vogue did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA new film, #LookAtMe by local film-maker Ken Kwek set in Singapore and which premiered in New York, was banned by authorities in October. The movie is about a young man who is offended by a pastor\u2019s stance on homosexuality. Government agencies said the film had the potential to cause social division and denigrated a religious community.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a series of reactions based on insecurity,\u201d said Michael Barr, an associate professor in international relations at Flinders University and the author of several books on Singapore politics. \u201cI have spoken to a few academics and civil society types and the sense of the creeping level of repression is very real.\u201d He added that decision makers feared losing control of the narrative.\n\nSingapore maintains that the majority of its citizens support the government\u2019s stance. In a speech in August, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted longstanding reservations by religious groups on legalising homosexuality. Shanmugam points to public surveys of Singaporeans that show majority support for the death penalty as a deterrent to drug trafficking.\n\nBut experts said the liberalisation of Singapore\u2019s cultural scene and the growth in activism were unavoidable. \u201cPeople are more liberal across generations. It is becoming more visible,\u201d said Chua.\n\nThat is especially true of online activity, another area where Singapore has clamped down. A court last month fined and jailed Titus Low, a 22-year-old OnlyFans creator, for three weeks for accessing his account in breach of a police order to stay off the video site. Low\u2019s channel features many sexually explicit videos and photos. He was originally charged with transmitting obscene materials by electronic means last year. Low\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEven so, some citizens are hopeful the repeal of Section 377A, as the law banning gay sex was known, will mean opportunities to push boundaries without breaking the law.\n\n\u201cIf peaceful activism and changing attitudes contributed to [the repeal], maybe there is hope for a softening on other issues, such as the death penalty,\u201d a Singaporean student told the Financial Times. However, even for them, it feels far away. \u201cFor now I am still worried about posting my views on Facebook \u2014 or in a newspaper.\u201d\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nSingapore rejects \u2018dirigiste\u2019 and \u2018authoritarian\u2019 tags\u00a0/\u00a0From TK Lim, High Commissioner of Singapore, London SW1, UK", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e1a4b2ff-ec42-466e-a5ec-9e50daf6514a"}, {"uuid4": "0d7431f5-a79c-47e5-a355-08ae331b6cd3", "title": "FT Cryptofinance: Lessons from Singapore ", "description": "Plus, Washington\u2019s brain drain problem and a Chinese spy story", "author": "Scott Chipolina", "published_date": "2022-10-28T12:04:59.264Z", "content": "Welcome to the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week we are asking if there are lessons to be learned from Singapore\u2019s approach to regulating the industry.\n\nBroadly speaking, there have been two approaches when it comes to regulating crypto.\n\nSome countries have sprung into action quickly, trying to turn themselves into a \u201ccrypto hub\u201d. Usually driven by politicians driven by fear of missing out on the alleged future of finance. Others have been more cautious, worried about a weakening of regulatory standards. Singapore fell into the first camp; the EU the second.\n\nThose jurisdictions trying to claim early mover advantage \u2014 that perhaps once looked at Singapore with envy \u2014 may want to pause.\n\nThis week the city-state effectively performed an inelegant manoeuvre and proposed a series of new regulations aimed at bolstering the jurisdiction\u2019s grip on bad crypto behaviour.\n\nThe original plan was to leverage Singapore\u2019s reputation as a stable, tech-friendly, educated country with an attractive tax environment. But that has recently been tarnished by a swath of high-profile controversies.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore published two consultation papers. My colleague Mercedes Ruehl and I wrote about it here. MAS said:\n\n\u201cSeveral misconduct cases have been reported by international media, including where legal proceedings were commenced against entities that did not have sufficiently robust business conduct practices in place,\u201d it said.\n\nYou can say that again. In just the past few months, Do Kwon\u2019s disappearance, and collapses at Three Arrows Capital and Hodlnaut have undermined Singapore\u2019s crypto approach, and now, the city-state\u2019s regulator seems to have noticed.\n\nBack in June, the MAS\u2019s chief fintech officer Sopnendu Mohanty said Singapore would be \u201cbrutal and unrelentingly hard\u201d on bad crypto behaviour. To propose tougher consumer protection laws \u2014 after the consumers you are meant to protect were left exposed to some of the worst failures in the crypto industry\u2019s history \u2014 just doesn\u2019t strike me as behaviour that lives up to a promise like that.\n\n\u201cThis extraordinary Game of Thrones-like battle to be the crypto hub is absurd,\u201d former chief of the SEC\u2019s Office of Internet Enforcement John Reed Stark told me. \u201cWhile the goal is admirable\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009crypto, blockchain and Web 3 are not the way to get you there. Ironically, they take you in reverse,\u201d he added.\n\nA city-state once described by industry giant Binance as a \u201ccrypto paradise\u201d is no longer leading from the front but is instead looking at what Europe has done.\n\nBuried deep in the MAS proposals, the regulator \u201cencourages\u201d digital payment token trading platforms to put \u201cgood industry practices\u201d in place to detect and deter unfair trading \u2014 things such as market manipulation, misleading conduct and insider trading.\n\nThis is remarkably similar to parts of Europe\u2019s long-debated, now imminent, Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. Indeed, MAS acknowledged the debt, saying: \u201cThese practices are similar to regulatory proposals put forward in other jurisdictions such as in Hong Kong and the EU.\u201d\n\nBut what it may ultimately reveal is that EU\u2019s marquee legislation becomes the global approach. After all, the EU is a regulatory powerhouse regardless of the industry. It\u2019s one of the world\u2019s biggest markets. Size matters. When it makes decisions, other jurisdictions take notice.\n\nBut what was notable about MiCA was the degree of acceptance from the industry itself. Circle\u2019s chief strategy officer and head of policy Dante Disparte said in the summer that MiCA offered a \u201cpathway for Europe to emerge as a competitive region for the safe, sound development of an always-on financial system\u201d.\n\nIn my view, industry buy-in can be interpreted two ways: that the crypto has successfully lobbied for rules it likes so it can continue as it likes, or that those rules aren\u2019t going to be so prescriptive, unexpected and stultifying that people will look elsewhere to expand their businesses.\n\nThat\u2019s the idea anyway; the question is whether MiCA will meet those goals when it comes into force, probably next year. But if nothing else, the slower approach is more likely to prevent the awkward dance performed by Singapore.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on Singapore\u2019s recent crypto moves? Email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nYou probably noticed WhatsApp go down this week.\n\nFreed from the distractions of group chats, maybe you mused that an outage underlined the risks of relying on a centralised service.\n\nIf so, you\u2019re not alone. Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at Bitfinex, offered similar counsel.\n\nYes, that\u2019s an executive of a centralised crypto exchange that, as it happens, suffered a hack of its own in 2016, which earlier this year came sharply back into focus in the wake of an alleged multi-billion dollar money laundering case.\n\nDigital asset investment products, like exchange-traded funds and notes, or closed-ended investment funds established as trusts, have been declining in popularity since the air came out of the crypto market.\n\nAccording to data shared by data analytics platform CryptoCompare, average daily aggregate product volumes have fallen under $100mn this month. Barring a late surge, that would make it the worst month since June 2020, just as the bull run was about to get going.\n\nThe figures are part of a wider story. Last year, when popular cryptocurrency prices were surging, or going \u201cto the moon\u201d as the lingo has it, prices were buoyed by flattering narratives about digital gold or hedging against inflation.\n\nThis year\u2019s crash proved those narratives no longer make sense and the result is a lot less excitement about crypto tokens.", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/66fc5b69-79f6-4e91-ae54-ff420e274fbd"}, {"uuid4": "4d387612-7ad2-4bce-856f-774d6d65be39", "title": "Singapore proposes crypto rules to bolster consumer protection", "description": "High-profile failures this year have sharpened focus", "author": "Mercedes Ruehl", "published_date": "2022-10-26T13:30:23.524Z", "content": "Singapore\u2019s regulators have ramped up warnings to retail investors over the \u201chazards\u201d of speculating in cryptocurrencies and outlined proposals to keep consumers safe, after a series of high-profile crypto failures linked to the city-state.\n\nIn two consultation papers issued on Wednesday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore proposed restricting retail investors from borrowing money or using credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies and from lending out their digital tokens in search of yields. It also wants crypto exchanges to test would-be crypto buyers to check they understand risks in what it calls a \u201chighly volatile\u201d asset class.\n\nSingapore has generally provided a welcoming environment for the crypto industry. Exchange Binance once described it as a \u201ccrypto paradise\u201d and several prominent firms have established themselves there. But regulators have sounded the alarm after a series of high-profile crypto implosions this year, and are proposing restrictions on some of the most popular speculative tools.\n\n\u201cMAS strongly discourages speculation in cryptocurrencies by consumers,\u201d it said. \u201cSeveral misconduct cases have been reported by international media, including where legal proceedings were commenced against entities that did not have sufficiently robust business conduct practices in place,\u201d it added.\n\nThis year, Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital collapsed, taking down exchange Voyager Digital with it. An international manhunt is also under way, with a focus on the city-state, to track down Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon, whose stablecoin terraUSD imploded in May.\n\nThe MAS has stopped short of an outright crypto ban, saying it welcomes the \u201ctransformative economic potential\u201d of the asset class. But trading platforms must ensure retail customers were fully aware of risks and had the financial resources to withstand large losses, it said. \u201cSupport for a digital asset ecosystem does not mean support for cryptocurrency speculation,\u201d it noted.\n\nThe MAS also said so-called stablecoins, which are designed to track the value of real assets such as the dollar in tokenised form, must be properly backed with reserve assets pegged to the Singapore dollar or other major currencies.\n\nNizam Ismail, founder of Singapore-based Ethikom Consultancy, told the Financial Times some proposals \u201cmay be overly prescriptive and go against the grain of Singapore\u2019s regulatory philosophy\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe prohibition against purchase of [tokens] by credit cards or by credit could unwittingly encourage retail investors to trade in\u00a0crypto derivatives, which are largely unregulated,\u201d Ismail added.\n\nBroader proposals include forcing service providers to ensure customer assets are segregated from their own assets and adopting \u201cgood industry practices\u201d against unfair trading, including monitoring trading activity and setting out rules governing trading.\n\n\u201cDigital payment token markets have been susceptible to unfair trading practices of market manipulation, misleading conduct and insider trading by nefarious actors,\u201d the MAS said.\n\nSingapore will be likely to encounter the same issues as other jurisdictions in monitoring and controlling trading by its citizens on platforms domiciled overseas or operating outside regulatory oversight. \u201cThe problem of unregulated entities operating in this space in Singapore is not accounted for,\u201d said Kelvin Low, a law professor at the National University of Singapore.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s proposals are open to public consultation until December 21.", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9074c158-bd38-4355-92dc-30e3d4ea0c01"}, {"uuid4": "f6739262-c31e-421b-8483-fbf7d9f619a3", "title": "UFC rival One Championship looks beyond Asian market", "description": "Singaporean mixed martial arts promoter prioritises investment to build fan base", "author": "Tsubasa Suruga", "published_date": "2022-10-05T22:00:15.685Z", "content": "Singapore\u2019s mixed martial arts promoter One Championship is expecting to reach profitability in a few years, its group president told Nikkei Asia, though he noted that the company was still prioritising investments to cement its global position outside Asia.\n\nFrom eye-catching short highlights on Facebook to live broadcasts on streaming services such as Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, the combat sports brand\u2019s fights have become ubiquitous across many tech platforms, gaining global reach thanks to more viewers staying at home during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nEven as one of the fastest-growing digital sports companies \u2014 with as many as 14bn views globally last year across social media platforms \u2014 One Championship is still focused on investing in overseas expansions in North America, particularly the US, where US promoter the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has a stronghold.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet [to break even]. It could take a few years. The clear thing is that we\u2019re on our way,\u201d One Championship group president Teh Hua Fung said in an interview.\n\nAt a time of market uncertainty, when more investors are placing greater scrutiny on profitability, One Championship\u2019s challenge highlights whether high-growth companies needing heavy investments can prove their growth stories from the initial lossmaking stage.\n\nTeh said he was confident the group\u2019s business model was \u201cinherently profitable\u201d, adding that \u201crevenue will grow very quickly\u201d once the company has strong brand recognition and the content to lure viewers in overseas markets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a theme park, or a piece of art \u2014 when it\u2019s not done, it\u2019s not worth much,\u201d said Teh, \u201cbut when it\u2019s done, it\u2019s worth a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you try to monetise too early, you actually limit your growth,\u201d he added.\n\nFounded in 2011 by chair and chief executive Chatri Sityodtong, a martial arts instructor turned entrepreneur with a Thai father and a Japanese mother, One Championship began mainly as a promoter of live events. Investors include Singapore\u2019s Temasek Holdings and America\u2019s Sequoia Capital.\n\nSince the late 1990s, combat sports have been through a dramatic rise and fall. In Asia, Japan\u2019s K-1 professional kick-boxing reached its height, followed by the mixed martial arts brand Pride, which at one point was one of the biggest competitors to UFC.\n\nBut One Championship saw south-east Asia\u2019s potential, with its traditionally rich martial arts culture, including muay Thai, silat melayu in Malaysia, the Philippines\u2019 eskrima or Myanmar\u2019s lethwei.\n\nApart from mixed martial arts, the company has featured muay Thai, submission grappling and Burmese boxing, making it a bigger platform than UFC in terms of the number of disciplines.\n\nWhile past Asian promoters had to rely on television broadcasts, One Championship took advantage of the rapid penetration of smartphones in the region.\n\n\u201cIn the old days, it was all about TV networks and TV stations,\u201d said Teh. \u201cDigital players are becoming right up there in the game.\u201d\n\nThe company has been expanding its media and digital revenue sources, such as media rights and sponsorships, which now account for more than half of its total revenue, according to Teh. In 2018, it became a unicorn, an unlisted company whose value tops $1bn, distributing content to over 150 countries.\n\n\u201cThis is an intellectual property business where you have to grow the IP to an appropriate scale before the revenue happens,\u201d said Teh. \u201cThe challenge is building the IP and getting it to a point where you have product and brand leadership and big distribution.\u201d\n\nThe years of the Covid-19 pandemic had brought a mix of \u201cgood and bad\u201d, Teh added. The absence of live events hit ticket sales and hosting fees, which are some of its main revenue sources.\n\nStill, Teh said, 2021 turned out to be a \u201crecord year\u201d for revenues, as the company was able to get wider viewership and license fees.\n\nAccording to a Nielsen report released in April, One Championship ranked second overall in digital viewership for global sports properties, just after the National Basketball Association of North America.\n\nThe combat sports company has travelled across platforms and is now venturing overseas with more partnerships to gain an audience beyond its main Asian markets.\n\nIn April, it announced a five-year distribution deal with Amazon\u2019s Prime Video to broadcast live events to the US and Canadian markets.\n\n\u201cThe more people watch us, the more they will know the brand and we get to acquire new fans in the world\u2019s largest sports market, and we\u2019re aiming to have physical live events in the US next year,\u201d said Teh.\n\nThe overseas expansion follows its latest $150mn funding in December last year, led by Guggenheim Investments and the Qatar Investment Authority. The round is reported to have given the group a valuation of $1.35bn.\n\nWhether the company can gain traction in the US, however, will be crucial to proving its growth story ahead of its much-anticipated initial public offering. Parent company Group One Holdings has reportedly chosen the US for an IPO.\n\n\u201cA potential IPO is one of several options we are considering to raise capital in the long term. We want the company to be ready because you never know when markets will turn. But there\u2019s no immediate [plan],\u201d said Teh.\n\n\u201cWhat we are focused on now is being good stewards of the money that we raised.\u201d\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on September 26 2022. \u00a92022 Nikkei Inc.

Singapore police have said Kwon is not in the city-state.\n\nKwon\u2019s case is not the only high-profile crypto controversy unfolding in Singapore, which was until recently pitching itself as a digital asset-friendly destination in competition with global rivals Dubai and Zurich.\n\nCrypto executives and experts said the lengthening list of scandals and collapses has tarnished Singapore\u2019s reputation after officials touted its stability, sophisticated regulation and tax-friendliness as an advantage for crypto companies and investors.\n\n\u201cThe reputational damage over the last six months is a lot more serious than has been let on,\u201d said Kelvin Low, a law professor at the National University of Singapore. \u201cEvery time one of these companies is brought up, they are mentioned [as being] based in Singapore.\u201d\n\nSome of the biggest crypto collapses can be traced through Singapore, which had attracted digital asset companies from all over the world.\n\n\u201cSingapore has the most liberal regulatory environment after Switzerland in terms of crypto investment,\u201d Kim Hyoung-joong, head of the Cryptocurrency Research Center at Korea University.\n\n\u201cCrypto players prefer to operate in Singapore because of transparent regulations and their easy access to investors for funding,\u201d said Kim.\n\nThree Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund that collapsed in June, started as a registered fund management company in Singapore.\n\nManagement of the company\u2019s sole fund later shifted to an offshore entity in the British Virgin Islands. Co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies have not revealed their location since Three Arrows\u2019 failure.\n\nSingapore\u2019s regulator reprimanded Three Arrows for providing false information and breaching certain asset management thresholds. It added that it was assessing whether further regulatory breaches occurred.\n\nHodlnaut, a Singaporean crypto lender that received in-principle licensing approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, halted withdrawals and cut the majority of its employees earlier this year.\n\nIn August, Hodlnaut was placed under interim judicial management. The company said this decision would \u201cprovide a better chance of recovery\u201d. Singapore police said that they were \u201clooking into\u201d Hodlnaut.\n\nSingapore police did not investigate the terraUSD collapse despite a complaint being filed, according to local media. Police did not respond to a request for comment regarding Terraform Labs and Kwon.\n\nMAS said \u201cnone of these troubled companies are licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u201d under its Payment Services Act, which regulates payments systems, and so were not under its jurisdiction.\n\nIt said Three Arrows Capital had \u201cceased to manage funds [in Singapore] prior to the problems leading to its insolvency\u201d. It added that Hodlnaut had withdrawn its licence application, so the \u201csuspension of services is not in breach\u201d of Singapore regulations.\n\n\u201cIn Singapore, as is the case in all other jurisdictions, not all activities related to cryptocurrencies are regulated,\u201d said MAS, adding that its \u201cevolving regulatory approach makes Singapore one of the most comprehensive in managing the risks of digital assets\u201d.\n\nAs the crypto crunch set in, regulators in Singapore have started taking a tougher line, with officials promising to be \u201cunrelentingly hard\u201d on bad behaviour in the sector.\n\nBut experts said Singapore was not doing enough to punish or investigate possible fraud as a crisis has swept through the digital asset industry, causing an avalanche of losses for retail investors.\n\n\u201cI do think there is an extent to which [Singapore] is willing to say one thing and do something quite different,\u201d an executive at a crypto company active in Singapore said.\n\nThe same executive said they believe Singapore was in a \u201ctight spot\u201d in trying to balance being seen as a \u201cserious player in the world economy\u201d and \u201ctrying to promote themselves as a hub for innovation in a nascent industry which is clearly showing itself to have more and more bad actors\u201d.\n\nIn August, MAS managing director Ravi Menon distanced the regulator from the scandals and said it would take \u201cfurther measures to reduce consumer harm\u201d.\n\nMost steps have been preventive measures to protect Singaporean retail investors, such as a crackdown on advertising, rather than disciplinary ones.\n\nThe changing tone from officials including Menon has caused some crypto companies to reassess their Singapore operations.\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, has abandoned plans to make the city a hub despite its chief executive Changpeng Zhao living there for much of 2021. Last year, it was also placed on the MAS investor alert list.\n\n\u201cSingapore is not a big focus for us,\u201d said Gleb Kostarev, regional head of Asia for Binance. \u201cA lot depends on regulation\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009previously Singapore was some kind of like crypto paradise\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009times changed.\u201d\n\nOthers have come to the defence of Singapore\u2019s status as a crypto hub, suggesting it would be unfair to blame the city-state.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s somewhat also unfair to try to put all the onus and responsibility on the regulators, when often the party to blame in many instances are the crypto markets players who frankly, in many cases, should know better,\u201d said one individual familiar with the matter.\n\nTeresa Goody Guill\u00e9n, partner at US law firm BakerHostetler, said an Interpol red notice for Kwon was \u201cunlikely to have an impact on legitimate companies\u2019 interest in forming or operating in Singapore\u201d.\n\nThe crypto industry \u201cdoes not appear to react negatively to law enforcement investigating allegations of criminal activity, fraud, and the like,\u201d she added.\n\nChainUp, a blockchain company that offers technology to crypto exchanges and other clients said it was expanding in the city-state.\n\nThe start-up relocated its headquarters from China to Singapore in 2019 as Beijing was signalling it was clamping down on the sector.\n\n\u201cI am confident in the approach of regulators,\u201d said Sailor Zhong, ChainUp\u2019s chief executive.\n\n\u201cNo one country can do it all and it is hard for Singapore\u2019s government to enforce rule of law for companies with operations abroad.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e7b85235-87e8-44c7-a97f-2d2ffa253465"}, {"uuid4": "4e0b3911-5a8b-409b-8870-47f30446d041", "title": "\u2018Not only cute chairs\u2019: the surprises of Singapore Design Week", "description": "Unusual, often sustainable materials \u2014 from dog hair to cow dung \u2014 were used to create innovative furnishings ", "author": "Lucy Watson", "published_date": "2022-09-29T10:14:50.951Z", "content": "The convention centre at Marina Bay Sands, 55 storeys below the world\u2019s longest rooftop infinity pool and surrounded by designer shops and celebrity chef restaurants, is a fitting place to find S$25,000 ($17,000) sculpted glass exercise bikes, displays by petrochemical companies, crystal chandeliers and a man in Balenciaga trainers aggressively painting a canvas to promote a new piano, being played by his twin brother.\n\nPerhaps less so the objects made from cow dung, cigarette butts, old newspapers and sweepings from dog groomers. But all of these were at the first FIND design fair, one of the sources of surprise at Singapore Design Week.\n\nLaunched in 2014, Singapore Design Week returned in 2022 after a two-year break. \u201cYou can really feel the city come alive again,\u201d says Dawn Lim, executive director of the Design Singapore Council. \u201cAnd we\u2019re ready\u201d.\n\nThe Design Week organisers say that the 2022 edition, which ran September 16-25, aimed to promote Singapore and its \u201cdistinctive brand of creativity\u201d globally. The hiatus, due to pandemic restrictions, was a \u201cgood time to hit the refresh button\u201d, says festival director Mark Wee.\n\nThe programme had three themes, or \u201cpillars\u201d: Design Futures, which builds on the idea of Singapore as a futuristic prototype for the world; Design Marketplace, which looks at design trends in south-east Asia and positions Singapore as a \u201cglobal-Asia hub\u201d; and the socially conscious Design Impact.\n\nEvents across Singapore included public installations, exhibitions and tours, as well as the Design Futures symposium at Victoria Theatre.\n\nDeveloped by creative director Paola Antonelli, curator and director of R&D at MoMA, the symposium was titled \u201cAgency for the Future: Design and the Quest for a Better World\u201d. Speakers included the architect Thomas Heatherwick \u2014 creator of huge public spectacles such as New York\u2019s Vessel, the B of the Bang in Manchester and London\u2019s unrealised Garden Bridge \u2014 who decried \u201cboring\u201d architecture.\n\nGerontologist Emi Kiyota, who has advised on building communities for retired monks in Bhutan, spoke about the need to create homes for seniors without segregating them. \u201cOlder people don\u2019t want to live only with other older people,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAgropolitan\u201d expert Stephen Cairns, of ETH Zurich\u2019s Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore, discussed how to turn a place that imports 90 per cent of its food into one that produces 30 per cent, as Singapore aims to do by 2030. His solution is to use black soldier flies to quickly process food waste into fertiliser for more crops. One question arose from the audience, though \u2014 is it halal?\n\nSingapore might not be \u201cgiving all the answers yet\u201d, says Antonelli. \u201cButit\u2019s asking the right questions, questions that can be extrapolated in the outside world.\u201d There is one certain conclusion drawn from Singapore Design Week. Design is \u201cnot only cute chairs\u201d, in her words.\n\nThese are the highlights from a week showcasing the best design.\n\nFIND design fair\n\nMarina Bay Sands hosted the first edition of new annual trade show FIND \u2014 Design Fair Asia. The show had more than 11,000 visitors over three days and more than 500 interior and furniture design companies, from Singapore and abroad. Partnered with Fiera Milano, home of Salone del Mobile, and with speakers including Low Yen Ling, minister of state for trade and industry, and Italian ambassador Mario Andrea Vattani, the programme was aimed at introducing Singapore to the global design circuit.\n\nBut for something more radical, there was the Emerge @ Find showcase, featuring 55 innovative upcoming design studios from south-east Asia, curated by Suzy Annetta, editor-in-chief of magazine Design Anthology.\n\nMany of these designers subverted traditional techniques and materials to create contemporary objects, such as 14th-century Thai celadon pottery glazing on insulated double-walled tea cups and bamboo sculptures by Piboon Amornjiraporn of Plural Designs. Weaving was used to create psychedelic geometric shapes, as in the vast digital loom jacquard piece by Tiffany Loy from Singapore.\n\nThe bendiness of locally grown cane and rattan was exploited in unfamiliar new shapes.\n\nIndonesian designer Alvin Tjitrowirjo showed a flowing Log bench, and Teerapoj Teeropas of design studio Kitt-Ta-Khon, from Thailand, added nylon to create arresting black-and- white stripes in his Qing dynasty-style Chino console table.\n\nSustainable and salvaged materials were another theme. Cynthia Chan from Singapore created woven and felted \u201cpelts\u201d and upholstery from clipped dog hair that would otherwise end up in landfill, recovered from local pet groomers. Adhi Nugraha from Indonesia made use of (thoroughly cleaned) cow dung and cigarette butts in curvy lamps, speakers and stools.\n\nAnybody drawn to dramatic shapes and sleek luxury was well served by a litany of pieces \u2014 including Dear Spirits, a series of jagged welded altars by Tan Wei Ming of Sputnik Forest Labs, Malaysia, and the gleaming blue-green resin Fossil chair and cabinet by Charif Lona of Thailand\u2019s Studio AOK.\n\nNew Optimistic Works by Studio Juju\n\nAt the National Design Centre, which houses studios, gallery space and the offices of the Design Singapore Council, was an exhibition by designers-in-residence Studio Juju. New Optimistic Works aims to \u201cwork with the possibilities and constraints of manufacturing within Singapore\u201d and develop a design identity for the country. Some goods are produced in part here, says Studio Juju\u2019s Timo Wong, but shipped elsewhere to be turned into finished products.\n\nPieces included a galvanised metal lamp, a collaboration with Chop Wah Hin Sheet Metal Works, which traditionally manufactures kettles, dustbins and industrial parts; a colourful metal side table that was finished in a car- spraying workshop; and recycled glassware fused in local kilns.\n\nN*thing is Possible by Potato Head, OMA & Friends\n\nAlso at the National Design Centre was an exhibition by hospitality group Potato Head in collaboration with architects OMA. Illustrating the company\u2019s dedication to reducing waste \u2014 it sends 5 per cent to landfill now compared with 50 per cent in 2018 \u2014 the installation featured slick furniture and other amenities for its Bali locations, created from hotel waste, displayed perched on top of their raw materials.\n\nThe average tourist in Bali produces 1.7kg of waste per day, which is a lot of free material. \u201cIt\u2019s not trash,\u201d says Simon Pestridge, chief experience officer of Potato Head. \u201cit\u2019s a raw product that can be turned into something beautiful.\u201d\n\nMax Lamb has designed colourful chairs from recycled plastic bottles. Each chair contains 830 of them, and offcuts of the resulting material are used to weld the panels together, ensuring no extra resources are required. Used cooking oil from the restaurants is cleaned and turned into scented candles in offcut wine bottles \u2014 for the Singapore exhibition the NDC on-site restaurant provided the oil. Damaged towels are turned into rugs and textiles by designers Toogood, Lamb and natural dye company Tarum, while a composite of styrofoam, oyster shells and plastics is used in toothbrush holders and bins for the hotel rooms.\n\nThe interiors of the Potato Head Studios hotel also feature recycled elements. Woven fabric by BYO Living covers the ceilings, made from 9,500 green plastic bottles per 2 square metre panel. \u201cTurning plastic into a material that will stand the test of time in a building is the best way to use it,\u201d says Pestridge.\n\nPotato Head is also salvaging discarded timber to create a series of furniture with Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. OMA and Max Lamb are utilising Ijuk fibre \u2014 discarded palm tree bark \u2014 to create beach umbrellas and lamps.\n\nGood Design Research pop up\n\nLocated outside the Bugis+ shopping centre, this public display featured 17 projects that have received grants from Design Singapore\u2019s Good Design Research initiative, which supports designers working on social cohesion, sustainable processes or new materials.\n\nThe pop-up was described as showing \u201cdesign research revealing its presence and relevance in our everyday lives\u201d. Projects included a renewable replacement for reinforced concrete by design studio Produce; a proposal for using trees felled in public spaces by Roger & Sons; underwear enabling people with physical disabilities to dress independently by Will and Well LLP; and an alternative to disposable packing used at hawker food centres by Forest & Whale.\n\nLucy Watson travelled as a guest of Design Singapore Council\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow @FTProperty on Twitter or @ft_houseandhome on Instagram", "tag": "singapore?page=6", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/13a1f876-c080-49d6-aea3-86b3a0c61201"}]
