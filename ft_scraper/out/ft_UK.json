In 2015, the then chancellor George Osborne introduced rights allowing individuals to move their defined benefit pension scheme to a defined contribution pot.\n\nMore than 100,000 transfers were undertaken in the five years after that, according to LCP, and six-figure transfer values were the norm. In many cases these transfers were undertaken specifically so the value of those pension pots could be passed on when the member died.\n\nIn last year\u2019s Budget, chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that unused pension funds will be included within IHT from April 2027.\n\n\u201cApplying inheritance tax to pension balances could prove to be a real gold mine for the government for many years to come,\u201d said Tim Camfield, senior consultant at LCP, who carried out the analysis.\n\nWhile he acknowledged that some retirees may react to tax changes by drawing down on pension assets faster, the changes will still generate significant tax revenue because such withdrawals will be subject to income tax, he said.\n\n\u201cEither way, as the DB transfer generation gets older, the government will start to see a multibillion pound revenue stream from the income tax or IHT on their pension pots,\u201d Camfield added.\n\nAccording to a freedom of information request from investment platform Interactive Investor to the Office for Budget Responsibility, an estimated 31,200 more estates will be subject to IHT in the three years from the 2027-28 tax year than if pensions had not been included in estates.\n\nThe OBR estimates that 66,600 people will pay inheritance tax in 2029-30, up from 40,100 in the current tax year.\n\nLCP calculates that these numbers should continue to surge because the peak in transfer activity from DB schemes to DC schemes was in 2017-18, after which tighter rules around financial advice followed by a fall in transfer values led to a dramatic reduction in the volume of transfers.\n\nThe typical person who transferred was in their late fifties, according to LCP. As these people gradually die over the coming years, any unspent balances in their transferred pension fund will be potentially liable to IHT.\n\nRob Morgan, chief analyst at wealth manager Charles Stanley, said that enhanced death benefits tended to be \u201cthe overriding factor\u201d for people choosing to transfer out of DB into DC.\n\n\u201cOn the basis that people will mostly have only done this where there is ample income and assets elsewhere, we can infer that there will be IHT consequences in many cases,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nData from the Financial Conduct Authority shows that between April 2015 and September 2018, more than 170,000 people who received advice transferred their DB scheme to a DC pot, with an average transfer value of over \u00a3350,000. This suggests the total amount transferred in this period was over \u00a350bn.\n\nShaun Moore, tax and financial planning expert at Quilter, a wealth manager, said a freeze in the inheritance tax threshold \u2014 which is set to last until 2030 \u2014 plus the inclusion of pensions from 2027 would enable the government to \u201ccash in on an ever-expanding pool of taxpayers\u201d.\n\nThe IHT tax-free threshold has been set at \u00a3325,000 since 2009. The impact of the frozen threshold alongside inflation and rising asset values means more people have been dragged into paying inheritance tax, with the trend likely to continue.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6608ece0-7522-4f36-b1f0-d1ff66c269c3"}}, {"id": "e9936c37-4a84-4d20-8948-5f520717d153", "event_name": "Defined benefit pension reform \u2018unlikely to be silver bullet\u2019 say trustees", "blurb": "UK government argue that funds should release surpluses back to companies for investment", "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Pension trustees warn that allowing companies to access surpluses trapped in defined benefit pension schemes is unlikely to deliver the jolt to the economy that the government hopes for.\n\nThe UK government said this week that lifting the restrictions on companies using money from their DB pension schemes \u2014 in excess of what they owe members \u2014 would \u201cunlock billions to drive growth\u201d.\n\nAccording to an FT analysis of company accounts there are over 30 companies in the FTSE 100 with DB schemes with surpluses of at least \u00a3100mn and a funding ratio of at least 110 per cent. Most declined to comment when contacted by the FT.\n\nEnergy company SSE said it was looking at the opportunities the reforms represent, but noted any impact would be relatively small.\n\nSchroders said after the announcement its would use \u2018\u2019approximately 10 per cent\u2019\u2019 of its scheme\u2019s DB section\u2019s surplus per year to support funding for defined contribution members.\n\nMost schemes can already access surpluses in their DB schemes, provided they passed a resolution in 2016 permitting them to do so, according to pensions consultant LCP. But in practice few do.\n\nOnly \u00a3180mn of surplus was accessed by companies between 2018 to 2023, according to government estimates last year. Any surplus extracted is taxed at a rate of 25 per cent, having been lowered from 35 per cent last year.\n\nWhere DB and DC pension funds are set up within the same trust, DB surpluses can be transferred to DC members if the scheme rules permit it without incurring a tax charge.\n\nTrade groups have broadly welcomed the government\u2019s proposals, provided appropriate guardrails are in place to protect members, but trustees have privately expressed doubts.\n\n\u201cWhy would I want to give away my comfort blanket?\u201d said one trustee of a FTSE 100 company pension scheme. He was sceptical that he would be prepared to release its surplus to executives, noting that for many years the scheme was in deficit and a fall in government bond yields could make its funding position more vulnerable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the silver bullet that the government hopes for,\u201d said another, adding that the total DB scheme surplus was only about \u00a368bn on a buyout basis \u2014 the level at which companies with the right permissions can access their surpluses.\n\n\u201cFirst you have to work out how much to give members, then you have to agree how much to give the company factoring you will have to pay 25 per cent tax,\u201d he said, adding that the time it takes to make these decisions was also \u201cnot trivial\u201d.\n\nRob Gardner, former co-chief executive of pensions consultancy Redington and founder of Rebalance Earth, a flood mitigation investor, said if he were a trustee weighing the return of a surplus to an employer there would be \u201csignificant challenges\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy fiduciary duty is to act in the best interests of members, and the potential long-term risks to them may outweigh the short-term benefits to the employer,\u201d he said.\n\nThe government estimates that around 75 per cent of the UK\u2019s \u00a31.2tn defined benefit corporate pension schemes are in surplus, worth a total of around \u00a3160bn. Some 96 per cent of these schemes \u2014 which provide pensions to 8.8mn people \u2014 are closed to new members.\n\nMinisters have been working out how to extract money from DB schemes after a rapid rise in interest rates radically improved scheme funding levels in 2022. The government\u2019s plans follow a consultation by the Conservative government last spring.\n\nPolicymakers also hope trustees will be emboldened to invest in more risky assets, rather than preparing schemes to be sold to insurance companies in a process known as buyout.\n\nBut Sankar Mahalingham, managing director at professional trustee firm Law Debenture, said it was \u201cunlikely that there will be a large number who will suddenly take a very different look at their investment strategy\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Pension Protection Fund, schemes had a net deficit on a buyout basis of almost \u00a3500bn as recently as 2019. That figure is now a surplus of \u00a368bn.\n\nWhen the Financial Times asked the Treasury if it would lower the \u2018buyout basis\u2019 threshold, a spokesperson said that \u201cschemes will continue to have to satisfy stringent funding requirements to be eligible to extract surplus\u201d.\n\nThe previous government\u2019s consultation explored enhancing protection from the Pension Protection Fund to 100 per cent to encourage trustees to be more comfortable with taking on more risk and releasing surpluses, as well as assessing if the tax rate for tapping surpluses should be lowered.\n\nThe Treasury told the FT it would set out these details \u201cin the spring\u201d.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c4df1f70-dd8d-4876-aa35-5d189657be66"}}, {"id": "c8836615-7c9d-4ad7-b234-8898e74df334", "event_name": "Starmer refuses to tear up workers\u2019 rights bill as compromises loom ", "blurb": "Prime minister will listen to business over exact details, as some within Labour push for \u2018serious tooth removal\u2019  ", "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Sir Keir Starmer is resisting pressure from business and some within his own party to tear up a new workers\u2019 rights bill, even as government officials conceded that details of the policy were still up for grabs.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s allies told the Financial Times he was fully committed to the \u201cmake work pay\u201d plan, which is seen in Number 10 as essential to tackling low pay, improving insecure employment and raising productivity even though it is expected to cost businesses \u00a35bn.\n\nBut senior Labour figures argue it may have to be made more business-friendly in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cIt needs serious tooth removal,\u201d said one Labour official close to Starmer.

So the measures may adjust to reflect that policy objective, but they will not limit our ambitions.\u201d\n\nMinisters are consulting businesses, unions and others on details of the Employment Rights bill, which is due to report to the House of Commons before Easter, in an increasingly tense political atmosphere.\n\nBusinesses are already smarting from last year\u2019s tax-raising Budget and a hike in the minimum wage that comes into force this April, while companies such as J Sainsbury and Airbus have already blamed higher costs for recent job cuts in the UK.\n\nNicola Smith, director of policy at the Trades Union Congress, said she believed ministers had strengthened their commitment to some parts of the bill, including a near-ban on employers using \u201cfire and rehire\u201d tactics to impose changes in contracts, which the legislation will allow only where a business is close to insolvency.\n\n\u201cFrom where I\u2019m sitting, we don\u2019t see any change of ambition,\u201d she added.\n\nThe proposals in the controversial package include scaling back zero-hours contracts and giving staff full rights of redress from their first day of employment.\n\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch this week branded it the \u201cunemployment bill\u201d and called on Starmer to ditch the entire package.\n\nOne imminent compromise will see ministers address concerns that employers could find themselves in endless consultation with unions over unconnected redundancies at different sites under the legislation as currently drafted.\n\nAt present, they are required to consult only when they make 20 or more workers redundant at a single site.\n\nMinisters have said they will bring forward amendments to the bill at the next stage of the parliamentary process \u2014 and both business and unions believe the timing of this next stage could slip into March.\n\nCraig Beaumont of the Federation of Small Businesses said two areas of focus for business lobbyists were around the proposals for day one protection against unfair dismissal, and the mechanism of the proposed \u201cban\u201d on exploitative zero and low hour contracts. However, he acknowledged the FSB was \u201cpitching for the stars\u201d in urging ministers to change the day one right to a protection that kicked in after a year.\n\nAngela Rayner, deputy prime minister and champion of the bill, has told colleagues that the idea of improving workers\u2019 rights is one of the Labour government\u2019s few popular policies, and a key weapon in the party\u2019s fight against Reform UK in working class seats.\n\n\u201cThe government is committed to implementing day one rights, ending insecurity, and strengthening the voice of working people,\u201d said one ally of Rayner.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4eb5e8ca-aba5-4426-8dce-4410dd313330"}}, {"id": "76dacb74-a040-4992-b173-3045fc9e0c93", "event_name": "City firms urge Rachel Reeves to curb cash Isas", "blurb": "Companies have told chancellor that scaling back tax breaks on savings accounts could boost UK financial services", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "Big City firms are urging Rachel Reeves to scale back tax breaks for cash Isas, a form of saving beloved by millions of Britons, in an effort to boost UK financial services and the economy by channelling money into stocks.\n\nCompanies including insurance group Phoenix and the London Stock Exchange Group have told the chancellor that almost \u00a3300bn held in cash Isas could generate better returns for savers if invested in stocks and shares, while supporting the City\u2019s dwindling equities market.\n\nOne senior banker said the issue had been raised by several finance executives at a recent meeting with Reeves and that she had not rebuffed the idea.\n\n\u201cThe state should not be giving a tax break for us all to park our money in cash,\u201d said Andy Briggs, chief executive of Phoenix, which operates the Standard Life brand.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that Rachel Reeves will conclude that it makes sense to refocus Isa tax incentives to make them consistent with the government\u2019s very welcome growth agenda,\u201d added Briggs, who was at the meeting.\n\nScrapping the cash Isa would be the biggest shake-up of the savings market since the products were first introduced by then-Labour chancellor Gordon Brown in 1999.\n\nCash Isas allow savers to earn tax-free interest on up to \u00a320,000 a year and are by far the most popular of the UK\u2019s Isas.

He stressed that the framework would help decision makers protect \u201cour highest quality agricultural land and make decisions about the long-term future of farm businesses\u201d.\n\nAlongside the estimates, the government said that any impact on food production from the land use changes could be offset by using technology and sustainable farming techniques to increase crop yields.\n\nSuccessive governments have shied away from embarking on the framework over fears of the backlash it would receive from farmers.\n\nNFU president Tom Bradshaw said: \u201cWe must have a land use plan in place, underpinned by sound science and evidence, that has British food at its heart.\u201d\n\nBut Victoria Vyvyan, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said it could mean farmers being told \u201cwhat they are and aren\u2019t allowed to grow, plant and rear on their land\u201d and called for safeguards to prevent \u201cmission creep\u201d from officials.\n\n\u201cWhenever the state gets involved, its tendency is to only become ever more prescriptive,\u201d she added. \u201cToday, the framework might be light touch, but tomorrow it won\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nLiberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael, chair of the cross-party environment, food and rural affairs committee, said the framework was \u201clong overdue\u201d.\n\n\u201cFarmers need to be able to plan ahead and they and other stakeholders have long called for clarity amidst a myriad of often conflicting demands,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo-thirds of England\u2019s land is agricultural, according to official statistics, with 38 per cent made up of arable land and 29 per cent grassland.

This still contrasts with the $9.7bn goods trade surplus the US reports with the UK.\n\nStarmer and Lord Mandelson, the new UK ambassador to Washington, are arguing that Trump should spare Britain from any general application of tariffs given the trading position between the two countries.\n\nThe statistics offices across the Atlantic are aware of the differences and have been co-operating to realign the data since 2017.

This is something many UK officials might not want to happen just yet.\n\nAn analysis by HM Revenue & Customs into US-UK trade asymmetries on vehicles does seem to not settle the issue.\n\nBefore 2022, US-origin goods that cleared EU customs in another EU country before coming to the UK were counted as European imports. This makes it harder to compare with US data.\n\n\u201cThis explains the negative asymmetry,\u201d the analysis stated.\n\nThe study refers to negative asymmetries when US exports of vehicles to the UK are larger than the corresponding UK imports from the US.\n\nFrom 2022, UK imports from the US on a country-of-origin basis should be comparable with US exports to the UK. \u201cInstead, there is positive asymmetry in 2022, which cannot be explained,\u201d concluded the analysis.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b7c434eb-e634-44a7-9997-4781196f6638"}}, {"id": "7c7c586d-e63d-411c-8eff-eca37f6b421c", "event_name": "Retirees can struggle to shift the \u2018saver mindset\u2019", "blurb": "Spend or save is a tricky balancing act as we age", "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0", "body": "After a lifetime of being a responsible saver, perhaps denying yourself luxuries in the pursuit of a comfortable retirement, your hard work has paid off. Your pension can provide a more than comfortable investment income. Plus, your calculations (often with the reassurance of a financial adviser) tell you that there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll run out of money. Yet spending still scares you.\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem? It\u2019s not maths, it\u2019s psychology. And it can have a pernicious and damaging effect on the experience of retirement.\n\nFinancial advisers say navigating the change in mindset from saver to spender is a challenge many clients are unprepared for. A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found around age 62, more than half of the sample have incomes higher than expenditure, and this figure increases to about 80 per cent by the end of retirement.\n\n\u201cIt is incredibly common to work with clients who have more than enough wealth to last them their lifetime, if not several, yet most feel at some level that they may still run out of money,\u201d says Katherine Waller, co-founder of wealth manager Six Degrees.\n\nOne problem is the preconditioning that comes through a savings habit lasting 30 to 40 years. Dan Haylett, director of TFP Financial Planning, says: \u201cWe\u2019re spoon fed saving and associate money in the bank with security. But in a modern retirement we need to flick the switch to spending.\u201d\n\nAnother issue is that there are no retirement \u201crole models\u201d to learn from. People retiring now have a very different experience to that of their parents and grandparents. Someone with a defined benefit pension retiring 25 years ago went from a regular income through their work salary to another secure guaranteed (albeit lower) income through the pension scheme. \u201cWe\u2019re now going from income, to no income and a pot of money that we have to deplete intentionally,\u201d says Haylett. \u201cAlso, that\u2019s a pot of money that gives us social status and a feeling of achievement. The sense of loss from spending it is huge in modern day retirement. People struggle with it.\u201d\n\nVicky Reynal is a psychotherapist who focuses on people\u2019s relationship with money. When it is hard to shift from saving to spending, she says it might be because saving was a psychological defence against negative feelings. \u201cChanging our behaviour could leave us feeling too vulnerable or unable to manage the emotions that emerge as we try to spend our hard-earned money,\u201d she says.\n\nMost experts cite childhood as a key influence. It doesn\u2019t matter how old we are, our spending is still influenced hugely by what we\u2019ve observed when growing up. Haylett says: \u201cThere\u2019s no blueprint if you look to parents or grandparents. For them, frugality was a badge of honour.\u201d\n\nIn the worst cases, the emotions preventing spending may be strong feelings of anxiety and fear. \u201cSome people\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. cling anxiously to every penny just in case a catastrophic \u2014 and unrealistic \u2014 series of events could materialise,\u201d says Reynal. \u201cSpending threatens a sense of security and evokes almost primal fears.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, people often overestimate how long they\u2019ll live, says Haylett. \u201cIf you\u2019ve had four aunts live to 101, I get it. But not many people know someone aged 100. I think the idea of a 100-year life is completely ruining people\u2019s retirement.\u201d\n\nIn the UK, people aged 65 can expect to live on average a further 19.7 years for men and 22.0 years for women, according to ONS data. This is projected to rise to 21.9 years for males and 24.1 years for females aged 65 years in 2045.\n\nOne way is to think of money left behind after death as a \u201clost opportunity\u201d. Haylett says: \u201cIf I fast forward 20-30 years and you still have 70 per cent of your net wealth on the table, people say it feels stupid and they have missed out.\u201d The potential for the government to tax it at the end is another incentive to spend and enjoy it now.\n\nBut the balance is difficult to get right, especially since advisers disagree on whether retirement spending should follow a U-shaped path or a straight line.\n\nMany advisers talk about the three phases of a 30-year retirement, roughly divided into 10 years each. First is \u201cgo-go\u201d, when people have lots of energy and may want to explore the world and spend money. Then comes \u201cslow-go\u201d, when spending slows. Finally, they enter the \u201cno-go\u201d, or resting years, when health may be poor. Spending is higher at the start and at the end too, if long-term care is needed.\n\nThe prospect of a large care bill at the end of life is what most people\u2019s anxiety centres around. \u201cPeople usually want a back-up plan in place,\u201d says Waller.\n\nThis is often your housing wealth. But it might also include gifting to family in tiers, holding some gifts back for later in retirement. Or using a gift and loan trust, where you can have access to the capital, but won\u2019t benefit from any investment growth.\n\nAnalysis by Interactive Investor, an investment platform, shows that someone living until age 100 could need an extra \u00a3260,000 pension wealth to give them a comfortable retirement, compared with someone who lives until 83 years old. The average nursing home costs around \u00a361,000 each year, so two years in a care home could cost around \u00a3122,000.\n\nDoug Brodie, founder and chief executive of Chancery Lane Retirement Income Planning, disputes the fact that spending is higher at the start of retirement. While some of his clients plan to spend an extra \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000 a year on holidays in the early years of retirement, he says in every single case he\u2019s found they don\u2019t. He puts this down to lifestyle being fixed by the time they reach retirement. \u201cIf you have all the time on your hands, would you go and spend a week living in a fancy hotel in Paris? Most people say \u2018that\u2019s not the lifestyle that makes me feel comfortable.\u2019 You\u2019ve spent 40 years embedding your lifestyle with kids, family and local relationships.\u201d\n\nMore often than not, Reynal says the feeling evoked around spending is guilt, either over its profligacy or the fact that money spent on themselves will reduce the amount their children inherit. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s the guilt of not having been better parents emotionally,\u201d she says.\n\nAll advisers agree that it\u2019s important to try to identify these unconscious discomforts \u2014 and this can be done in conversation with family or a trusted adviser. \u201cTalking can be emotive but writing it down or seeing it in writing can be different,\u201d says Waller.\n\nMoira O\u2019Neill is a freelance money and investment writer.

Following the Budget in October, this has changed to \u201cspend your pension before Rachel Reeves does.\u201d\n\nInheritance tax will be extended to unspent pension pots from 2027 \u2014 prompting the well-advised wealthy to have a radical rethink of their retirement plans. Whether retirees opt to take money out of pensions and spend it, gift it to the next generation or leave it where it is, it is set to be a \u201cgold mine\u201d for the Treasury, generating \u00a340bn in additional taxes over the next two decades, according to former pensions minister Sir Steve Webb.\n\nThis will be music to the ears of whoever might be chancellor by the year 2030 (I bet it won\u2019t be Reeves) when tax revenues from this change are predicted to accelerate. But could behavioural changes offer a near-term boost for the property market and the consumer economy?\n\nWebb is well placed to calculate the potential upside. Now a partner at consultancy LCP, he has based his estimate on the huge number of final salary pensions that were transferred out of defined benefit schemes between 2015-2020, typically by men in their late 50s working for blue-chip companies.\n\nThe era of ultra-low interest rates ensured high transfer values, tempting over 100,000 retirees to trade the security of an income that would die with them for a more flexible investment pot they could pass to their heirs free of IHT (and in some cases, free of income tax) \u2014 until now.\n\nSpouses and civil partners aside, from 2027 anyone inheriting a pension pot could have to pay IHT and income tax at their highest marginal rate. To avoid this \u201cdouble taxation\u201d, financial advisers and their clients are weighing up the merits of upping pension withdrawals. These would be subject to income tax, but prudent use of gifting allowances (including the so-called \u201cseven year rule\u201d) could lessen IHT liability, or remove it altogether.\n\nGifting property deposits to children or grandchildren will be the first thought for many. Last year, the bank of mum and dad spent \u00a39.2bn supporting 335,000 house purchases in the UK, according to Legal & General, with almost half of buyers under 35 receiving family assistance. If this ratio rises as Reeves tweaks mortgage affordability for first-time buyers, it could boost property prices and stamp duty revenues.\n\nDavid Hearne, a chartered financial planner at FPP, says the measures will reshape the great generational wealth transfer. Many of his clients are now considering making regular pension withdrawals (incurring income tax on the way out) and funding pension contributions for their adult children, who will receive tax relief and employer contributions on the way in.\n\nHe predicts equity release to extract value from the family home will be a popular tool. Money taken that way can be spent or gifted, with debts reducing the value of the estate and lessening the sting of IHT bills.\n\nTo encourage wealthy retirees to spend and enjoy their money, Hearne keeps a big reel of 40-per-cent-off stickers on his desk as a conversation starter. \u201cSpending \u00a320,000 on the trip of a lifetime could be seen as only costing \u00a312,000 as the money won\u2019t be subject to 40 per cent IHT when you die,\u201d he says.\n\nAs advisers and their clients rejig plans, could this pulling forward of spending help to turbo-charge VAT receipts and boost the lacklustre UK economy?\n\nDespite LCP\u2019s punchy predictions, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, has doubts. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge difference for the overall economy\u201d, he says, \u201calthough it could be for individuals or their heirs.\u201d\n\nMuch will come down to timing. If retirees pull more out of pension pots sooner than expected, this will reduce their spending power in later years. And while the wealthiest can spend (or gift) with confidence, the biggest worry for those less affluent is balancing investment risk against longevity risk.\n\nThose in my own circle who netted tidy sums by transferring their defined benefit pension into a Sipp have had a nerve-racking week as DeepSeek roiled global stock markets.\n\nRun down the pension too much, and they risk running out of money in retirement. Plus, they will have given up any spousal benefits in their defined benefit scheme and will need to provide enough for a surviving partner. This, and the lottery of care costs, could be a brake on spending and gifting.\n\nDifficult choices lie ahead. But with more than half of all those retiring between now and 2060 forecast not to be saving anywhere near enough, these are nice problems to have.\n\nClaer Barrett is the FT\u2019s consumer editor and author of the FT\u2019s Sort Your Financial Life Out newsletter series; claer.barrett@ft.com; Instagram and TikTok @ClaerB\n\nclaer.barrett@ft.com", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0093bbce-ea65-4488-9b0c-9f79836ac08e"}}, {"id": "07dd37fb-40a8-4e32-a9b5-137c6135c0d4", "event_name": "Britain must decide if it is to remain a serious player on defence", "blurb": "Fiscal constraints put Starmer and Reeves in an unenviable situation, but Trump has changed the terms of the debate", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "Mercurial Donald Trump may be, but he has a gift for shifting the debate. And sometimes, he is right. When it comes to defence spending, the only surprise is how long Europe\u2019s Nato members have managed to freeride on American taxpayers.\n\nEurope is rearming, and not only because of the fear that Trump will call for members to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence at Nato\u2019s June summit. Russia\u2019s nuclear rhetoric, cyber attacks, the sabotage of undersea cables in the Baltic Sea and China\u2019s vast new military command centre demonstrate that, as Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, said last year, \u201cthe world has got rougher\u201d.\n\nRussia\u2019s neighbours have been upping their game for some time. Poland\u2019s military outlay is already 4 per cent of GDP and its armed forces are now the third biggest in Nato. In Sweden, every household recently received a government leaflet, \u201cIn Case of Crisis or War\u201d, advising on emergency evacuation and how to store food if power fails.\n\nIn Britain, the threat still feels remote. The government refuses to say when it will meet its target of raising defence spending from 2.3 per cent to 2.5 per cent, fearing unpopular deep cuts elsewhere.\u00a0But time is not on its side.\n\nThe UK still has a good story to tell. Our special forces, our intelligence services and our nuclear deterrent are a strong card for London in its relationships with Brussels and Washington. We play a leadership role in the Joint Expeditionary Force of northern and eastern European Nato members, we provide nuclear attack submarines to Australia through the Aukus partnership with the US and we are part of the Global Combat Air Partnership to build a next-generation warplane, with Italy and Japan.\n\nWithout commensurate funding, however, these involvements accelerate overstretch. Defence experts repeat the phrase \u201chollowed out\u201d. Britain is relying on shiny totemic kit \u2014 its aircraft carriers and Trident \u2014 to project a level of underlying muscle that it no longer has.\n\nEven the 2.3 per cent is not quite what it seems, since it includes pensions. New \u201chunter killer\u201d submarines have been stuck in port because of a lack of repair docks. General Sir Patrick Sanders, former chief of the general staff, has warned that Britain is no longer capable of launching the kind of operation it did in southern Iraq in 2003. The defence select committee complained a year ago that it could not even adequately judge Britain\u2019s readiness, because the Ministry of Defence is so much more secretive than Nato allies.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is waiting for the strategic defence review in the spring. The reviewers include Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser once described by Trump as \u201ca deep state stiff with a nice accent\u201d (she hails from County Durham). Hill knows better than most that Trump takes a maximalist position. Her memoir quotes the president, in his first term, complaining that advisers who criticised his threats to leave Nato were \u201cruining my leverage\u201d.\n\nBut even if Trump settles for more like 3.5 per cent, the UK is still in a fix. Starmer needs to decide, now, what spending envelope to give the reviewers. Some Labour backbenchers have warned that dithering is a grave mistake. Not all MPs or voters would support cutting transport, say, to fund defence. But few would want to see Britain let down Ukraine, after all we have done.\n\nBritain now faces an existential question: are we going to remain a serious player or be exposed as a Potemkin power, talking a big game while resources dwindle? There is always disagreement behind the scenes on whether we should be fighting \u201cthe last war\u201d or the next one. But the experience in Ukraine suggests winning requires both cutting-edge technology and conventional weapons, not one or the other. And that mass matters: in terms of troops, tanks and artillery. The ceasefire envisaged by Marco Rubio, US secretary of state, is likely to require America\u2019s European allies to help maintain a frozen zone between Ukraine and Russia, perhaps for some time.\n\nThere are always tensions, too, between the different armed services. But without a bigger fiscal envelope, it is unlikely that Britain can continue to be a serious player on both land and sea.\n\nThe fiscal constraints make this a hellish situation for the government. Chancellor Rachel Reeves didn\u2019t mention defence this week in her speech on growth, but it is a core part of the industrial strategy, and rightly so. Although the ministry of defence does not publish a complete analysis of where it sources weaponry, we know that parts of the F-35 fighter jets are being made here. The Typhoon weapons system, according to BAE Systems, has contributed \u00a31.4bn to the UK economy\u00a0in export sales. The industry supports an ecosystem of suppliers which contribute to regeneration.\n\nBehind the scenes, there has been lobbying for both London and Brussels to exempt defence from fiscal rules on national security grounds \u2014 this seems unlikely to appeal to Reeves.\n\nBut there is yet another challenge brewing, from calls to boycott the defence industry. In 2020, the Supreme Court over-ruled the then Conservative government\u2019s attempts to stop the Local Government Pension Scheme divesting from defence, after an action brought by the Palestine Solidarity campaign. A number of local authorities have dumped defence stocks.\n\nSuccessive governments have performed a delicate dance of the veils on defence, trying to maintain prestige while fudging resources. But now the music has stopped. The decision that Reeves and Starmer make in the coming months will have an impact on the UK\u2019s alliances, our perceived position in the world, and our perception of ourselves.\n\ncamilla.cavendish@ft.com", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/74ea2a31-c023-4aa8-a103-e42dae3528d5"}}, {"id": "0c76a964-c5e0-418c-8c4e-259a804180b8", "event_name": "What\u2019s behind the boom in car parking charge tickets?", "blurb": "The industry, which has attracted lots of private equity investment, is becoming increasingly punitive", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "Parking in the UK has become a major annoyance for drivers. There are the fiddly apps, the cashless machines that never seem to work and the ever-increasing rates. Fall foul of the rules and you can expect a parking charge notice to be posted through your door within days.\n\nMotorists have taken to online message boards to rail against what they see as profiteering, alleging unfair fees, confusing signage and heavy-handed enforcement, with many believing the process has become more vindictive in recent years.\n\nDrivers are certainly getting more fines. In the 2023-24 tax year, private car park operators handed out a record near-13mn parking charge notices. In the six months to last October, they were being issued at a rate of one every two seconds.\n\nPrivate parking companies have grown rapidly over the past decade and now manage more than 50,000 sites across the UK, up fivefold from 2012, according to the International Parking Community (IPC), a trade body. Over the same period, penalty ticket issuance has skyrocketed, rising more than eightfold.\n\nOperators say their growth has been commensurate with a rise in demand for parking spaces and an increase in the number of people repeatedly flouting the rules.\n\nWill Hurley, chief executive of the IPC, is keen to point out that most people pay for their parking without incident \u2014 99.77 per cent of \u201cparking events\u201d are \u201cseamless\u201d, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely right that we look to improve,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut unfortunately the sector only gets talked about when something goes wrong.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s a sector that has enjoyed bumper profits recently. Seven of the UK\u2019s top 10 largest private car park operators have brought in record operating profits in the last three years, according to a Financial Times analysis of Companies House filings.\n\nThe industry has also undergone significant change. A wave of takeovers since 2017 has brought most of the biggest players under the ultimate ownership of private equity groups such as Wall Street behemoth KKR.\n\nHurley claims that, across the industry, the money from \u201cpaid-for parking\u201d far exceeds that from \u201cenforcement\u201d. That isn\u2019t true of every car park operator. In its latest accounts, ParkingEye, the fifth-largest operator by revenue, claims it earns most of its turnover \u201cfrom the issue of parking charge notices\u201d. Smart Parking, the UK\u2019s 11th largest car park operator, earned almost 90 per cent of its global revenue last year \u2014 the majority of which originated in the UK \u2014 from issuing penalty tickets, according to its 2024 annual report.\n\nMost of the top 10 did not respond when contacted by the FT. National Car Parks, the largest operator, declined to comment and Q-Park, the second largest, says it operates barriered facilities and does not issue parking tickets. Apcoa says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of its income is \u201cderived from client management fees where we do not take a share from parking/penalty charge notices\u201d. (Creative Car Park, NCP and Q-Park have not achieved record profits in the past three years.)\n\nAlthough often described as parking \u201cfines\u201d, the tickets issued by private companies are technically parking charge notices, invoices that allege a motorist breached the contract to which they implicitly agreed by parking on private land.\n\nOnly local authorities can issue fines, says Scott Dixon, a consumer advocate and founder of The Complaints Resolver blog. Parking charge notices often \u201clook the same [as local authority tickets] and that [means] most motorists see them as fines to pay off as soon as possible,\u201d he explains.\n\nMore than 80 per cent of paid parking charge notices are settled soon after they are issued, according to a submission to parliament by Euro Car Parks. Those who have paid the charges generally aren\u2019t allowed to appeal them subsequently.\n\nParking companies can obtain car owners\u2019 details from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), which sells them on request to approved members of the parking industry\u2019s two trade associations \u2014 the British Parking Association and the IPC. Last year, the DVLA netted at least \u00a331.9mn from the practice. The RAC Foundation, a think-tank, uses the number of vehicle keeper requests made by car park management companies as a proxy for the number of penalty tickets issued \u2014 and FT Money has done the same.\n\nSo how did we get here? Many consider the original sin to be the ban on vehicle clamping on private land, introduced by the government in 2012.\n\nAccording to Hurley, the lack of deterrent resulted in many more people breaking the rules. Others disagree.\n\nSteve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, says: \u201cWhat no one foresaw [in 2012] was the scale at which parking firms would subsequently go after registered keepers. A big part of the issue is that cheap camera technology and ready access to DVLA data means pursuing car owners to \u2018enforce\u2019 parking offences is less expensive than driving around to apply wheel clamps used to be.\u201d\n\nThere have been numerous calls for reform. In 2022, the government attempted to regulate the industry and impose a \u00a350 cap on most charges. That year, car park operators launched multiple legal challenges, leading the government to withdraw its proposals.\n\nLast October, the industry set up its own code of conduct and in January 2025 formed a new panel \u2014 that it claims is independent \u2014 to oversee it.\n\nHurley, whose IPC organisation was not involved in 2022\u2019s legal challenges, says: \u201cWhat I want to achieve is for people to read the signage, follow the signage and then avoid a parking charge, because ultimately it\u2019s really easy not to get a parking charge if you\u2019re told how to avoid it.\u201d\n\nThe first item on the new panel\u2019s agenda was to stop motorists being penalised for taking more than five minutes to pay for parking.\n\nIn December, Excel Parking dropped its court claim against Rosey Hudson, a 31-year old from Leicestershire, whom it had charged nearly \u00a32,000 in accumulated penalty tickets. Her case, disputed by Excel, was that she was delayed in paying for her parking on multiple occasions due to a poor mobile phone signal when trying to use the car park\u2019s app.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2024, Excel Parking tripled its operating profits to \u00a35.1mn and last year its operating margin stood at 28 per cent, the highest level since it started filing public accounts. Owner and founder Simon Renshaw-Smith was paid a dividend of \u00a3522,000 last year on top of at least \u00a3150,000 for his role as a director. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExcel has nearly halved its headcount since 2017 and slashed its wage bill by over a third, according to its 2024 annual report.\n\n\u201cWe need parking to support our high streets, towns and city centres, but something is clearly going wrong,\u201d says Catherine Atkinson, the Labour MP for Derby North, who has raised the issue of unfair parking charges in parliament.\n\nShe says that many of her constituents paid for parking but had received parking charge notices for exceeding grace periods allowed by car park operators. \u201cFor a lot of people, it\u2019s been because they\u2019ve been older or assisting others, or they\u2019ve really struggled with [parking payment] apps and broken machines.\u201d\n\nAtkinson called for \u201can independently set code of practice\u201d and says she will broach the subject with parking executives at a roundtable in February.\n\nBack when the government tried to set new rules for the sector, parking companies made the argument that a full impact assessment had not been carried out. A survey by audit firm Mazars on behalf of the BPA argued that the government\u2019s fee caps would bankrupt almost half of private car park operators affiliated with the trade body within a year.\n\nSpeaking to MPs in 2021, Philip Boynes, chief executive of ParkingEye, said the drop in revenues resulting from the changes would be \u201cunsustainable\u201d without significant cost-cutting and job losses.\n\nBoynes told the MPs that the \u201caverage profit of a car parking operator was about 2.1 per cent\u201d, citing a report by IbisWorld.\n\nThe FT\u2019s analysis shows that ParkingEye\u2019s operating margin that year was 15 per cent, up from 5 per cent in 2020. From 2015 onwards, aside from the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, the company\u2019s margins have remained above 20 per cent.\n\nBoynes did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nParkingEye issued roughly one in five of all UK parking charge notices last year. It is owned by the world\u2019s largest infrastructure investor, Macquarie, which previously owned distressed utility provider Thames Water. ParkingEye manages car parks for clients ranging from McDonald\u2019s to the NHS.\n\nIn 2023 the company made an operating profit of \u00a315.5mn from revenues of \u00a357.5mn \u2014 a margin of 27 per cent.\n\nParkingEye says it \u201coperates responsibly and fairly\u201d. The company adds its growth has \u201cbeen in response to the increase in demand [from] landowners who wish to ensure an increasing motorist population can access [facilities] that might otherwise become congested by non-compliant motorists who misuse the parking facilities\u201d.\n\nThe industry\u2019s own code of conduct, which came into effect last year, was largely similar to the government\u2019s original, but omitted the proposed \u00a350 cap on parking charge notices and restrictions on debt recovery fees.\n\nAt the time, the RAC Foundation said the industry\u2019s code \u201cconveniently avoided some of the biggest issues [that] badly need[ed] to be addressed to prevent drivers being taken advantage of.\u201d\n\nSir Greg Knight, the former Conservative MP who introduced legislation to regulate the sector, is urging the new government to \u201ctake up the gauntlet\u201d and introduce a \u201cnational parking code\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe present situation is highly unsatisfactory; parking companies are in effect policing their own rules,\u201d he says. \u201cThe threat of legal action was unfortunate, but the government appears to have let this matter drift.\u201d\n\nThe government says it is \u201cdetermined\u201d to protect motorists and \u201cdrive up standards in the industry\u201d. It adds that it will \u201cset out further details on the private parking code of practice as soon as possible\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn my book, this is unfinished business,\u201d says Knight.\n\nAdditional reporting by Alistair Gray.

What does protecting historic homes mean? And how do we balance responsibility for the past with the needs of the future?\u00a0", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "I live in a Grade II-listed house in a historically important, but somewhat down-at-heel town on the UK\u2019s east coast. I love it; it has sash windows, a little cast-iron boot scraper set into the wall next to the front door, and someone\u2019s name scratched on to the rear window in a 19th-century cursive. But it is hard to keep warm, and when we first moved in the roof leaked. Living in a heritage property means a responsibility to look after a piece of architectural history. But it\u2019s a privilege that occasionally feels like a Kafka-esque nightmare.\n\nWe had to apply for permission to overhaul our leaky roof. The local heritage officer initially suggested that repairs would not be permitted, as our home would no longer be in keeping with the rest of the terrace: presumably because it would not be leaking.\u00a0Thankfully, the local planning officer overruled, seeing that repairs would help keep the house standing.\n\nToday, as the country\u2019s housing, energy and climate crises reshape the way we inhabit and think about properties, the question of how to manage the country\u2019s historic buildings is more complex than ever. What does conservation mean in a matrix of crises? And how do we balance responsibility for the past with the needs of the future?\n\nBritain has the oldest housing stock in Europe. In England alone, around 20 per cent of all housing was built before 1919, and more than 400,000 buildings are on a protected conservation list due to their architectural and historical significance. While housing on this list makes up only about 2 per cent of the country\u2019s housing stock, 2.8mn homes are within conservation areas with a separate, additional set of rules for how to look after them. For many, it can be very hard to make \u2014 often urgently needed \u2014 changes to your home.\n\nAnd they are needed. A 2020 survey by Tado found that a UK home with an indoor temperature of 20C and an outside temperature of 0C, loses on average 3C after five hours, three times more than the average German home. Continued reliance on gas boilers not only makes homeowners particularly sensitive to price spikes or supply interruptions, but makes meeting the UK\u2019s 2050 net zero climate targets incredibly challenging.\n\nThe system of \u201clisting\u201d buildings in the UK was started by the government during the second world war, so that churches and other important, mostly pre-1750, buildings could be monitored for damage. The list was drawn up by 300 architects. In 1947, the Town and Country Planning Act gave statutory power to the list. The late 1960s saw its first survey completed, and then another in the 1980s. Today, government body Historic England\u2019s listed buildings can be Grade II, II* or I, with Grade I designating a building \u201cof exceptional interest\u201d. Inclusions range from landmarks such as London Bridge to a 19th-century urinal in Westminster.\n\nBut beyond these more systematic efforts, the expansion and management of what counts as a heritage building has been more piecemeal. In 2019, Historic England published a report by Matthew Saunders, former secretary of the Ancient Monuments Society, who had been commissioned to review the system. He acknowledged the \u201cvital role of listing in protecting this country\u2019s architectural heritage\u201d but described the uneven coverage and detail in the listings in terms of geography, architectural style and time period. \u201cExamples of the deficiencies are legion,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSo what purpose does listing serve today? And who decides whether a building should be protected? And what does \u201cprotected\u201d mean?\n\nIan Morrison, the director of policy and evidence at Historic England, emphasises that the body is not about preservation but conservation: \u201cIt is about making sure we manage change sensitively.\u201d The body makes decisions about which buildings are added to the list. But the final decision lies with the secretary of state.\u00a0A common misconception is that Historic England approves or denies applications for improvements or repairs; this is in the hands of local planning authorities: bodies that are increasingly under-resourced.\n\nHistoric England\u2019s own survey of local authorities in a 2024 report reveals the extent of the resourcing crisis: between 2006 and 2018 the number of archaeologists and conservation specialists working for local authorities decreased by 35 per cent and the spending on heritage-related development control by 57 per cent.\n\nWhile for some, owning a listed building can seem like a nightmare of bureaucracy and expense, for others it carries a cultural cachet. There is a healthy market for architecturally important and historical houses, although in most cases both purchase and maintenance come with a premium. Academic and architecture critic Matthew Lloyd Roberts described the dilemma as simply a question of \u201cHow much money are you going to spend to improve the comfort and retain the aesthetics of your listed house?\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving a listed status doesn\u2019t put buyers off,\u201d argues Georgia Grunfeld, acting head of appraisals for specialist estate agencies The Modern House and Inigo. Opportunities for sensitive renovations can be a selling point: \u201cThese houses are often appreciated for lower carbon footprint repairs too,\u201d says Grunfeld. \u201cVernacular building materials, like traditional lime render and paint, wool insulation etc, can often be sourced in surprising proximity.\u201d\n\nIn the context of both the climate and housing crises, there are some bigger questions to ask about the importance of building conservation. While the number of listed houses is relatively small, it draws attention to the wider value of reusing and adapting existing buildings.\n\nThe best way to conserve historic buildings is to adapt them and keep them in use, says Rachael Owens from the National Retrofit Hub: \u201cThe risk is that buildings fall into a state of disrepair and they then need even more work doing to them\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.[but] if we don\u2019t do this work, people won\u2019t be able to live in these buildings.\u201d Most listed houses are maintained by their occupiers rather than heritage bodies: Morrison says that Historic England is trying to avoid \u201can environment whereby it is too difficult for people, then historic buildings become less attractive. Obsolescence is the thing we need to avoid the most.\u201d\n\nIn February last year, 59 per cent of local authorities told Historic England they were seeing an increase in retrofit casework relating to historic buildings in the past year. In a separate survey, more than half of people living in historic buildings told Historic England they were planning a project to adapt their home to improve energy efficiency in the future. Historic England has provided the public with resources intended to make this process easier on the Your Home section of its website. It makes the case that if \u201cproperly designed and maintained\u201d, heritage buildings can provide better energy efficiency than many would expect, because they are \u201cdesigned to work with their environment\u201d.\n\nThere is much innovative work being done to adapt historic buildings for the present day. Two of the winners of Architects\u2019 Journal\u2019s 2024 Retrofit & Reuse Awards stand out. Led by specialist firm SPASE Design, Grade I-listed Athelhampton House was turned from a leaky kerosene and oil-fuelled stately home into a building with zero energy bills. Sensitively integrated breathable insulation in the floors and ceilings helped, but most was achieved through the installation of air-source heat pumps, solar panel arrays and battery storage. Of course, this is only possible if you have the land and capital to accommodate this scale of renewable energy generation \u2014 and the ancient yew hedges to hide it all behind.\n\nThe Old Chapel presents a very different approach. Here Tuckey Design Studio recycled materials from the site and elsewhere including reclaimed timber and terracotta tiles to reduce waste and opened up the building to promote circulation and natural ventilation. It encapsulates a \u201cfascinating dialogue between old and new, maintaining the rich patina and history of a place in preparation for a new purpose,\u201d says project lead Elena Aleksandrov. But again, these kinds of projects are not always an option for many people\u2019s budgets.\n\nHistoric England says it wants to remove some of the additional fear and cost about modernising. In 2024 it released an advice note setting out best practice for the adaptation of historic homes, designed to support local authorities in making decisions that balance heritage and environmental impact.\n\nAnd historic buildings do not need to be handled with kid gloves, says Anna Hollyman, co-head of the Regenerative Places Programme at the UK Green Buildings Council (UKGBC). Those that survive tend to be robust. \u201cBecause of this they can be moulded and remoulded: basically the epitome of \u2018long life loose fit\u2019\u201d. The phrase comes from a prescient speech made by Alex Gordon, then president of RIBA, in 1972. He proposed that good architecture is designed to be later adapted. This important principle today is encouraged by bodies such as UKGBC, which advocates for conserving and adapting buildings to prevent unnecessary damage to the environment.\n\nSaunders writes in his 2019 report that \u201chistoric buildings and monuments\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009do as much to define this country as its democracy and language\u201d. But which buildings are deemed architecturally significant enough to be worth protecting is as contentious an issue as how they are protected.\n\nSocial housing has been a flashpoint for debates about the listing system in recent decades, says architecture critic Owen Hatherley. Take the Park Hill estate in Sheffield, a Modernist building that became Grade II*-listed in 1998. A rare modern addition to the list, the development was completed in 1961 and is an internationally important example of the \u201cstreets-in-the-sky\u201d style of architecture, with wide decks connecting flats at the upper levels. But despite the high level of protection afforded by the listing, the local planning authority approved plans that included the gutting of three flanks of the building for transformation into luxury apartments.\n\nFor Hatherley this plan meant \u201calmost destroying the entire building \u2014 as if it were only the frame that was listed\u201d. Historic England thinks differently, and holds up the Park Hill site as an exemplar project. \u201cFrom our perspective, the buildings have been successfully repurposed without losing their primary architectural significance,\u201d says Morrison.\n\nThe Twentieth Century Society argues that the listing criteria is not fit for purpose, because it favours older buildings over more recent ones: the government\u2019s guidance on selection states that buildings less than 30 years old \u201care not normally considered to be of special architectural or historic interest because they have yet to stand the test of time\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne big flaw in the current system is that there is no mechanism for looking at the buildings \u2018coming of age\u2019 each year,\u201d says the society\u2019s director Catherine Croft. According to her, the majority of cases in which a recommendation to list is overruled by the secretary of state are for postwar buildings, and these decisions are often \u201cinfluenced by lobbying from owners and swayed by arguments which go beyond\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009architectural and historic value\u201d \u2014 factors such as cost of redevelopment or local regeneration.\n\nHatherley critiques society\u2019s broader approach to old buildings. The work at Park Hill, and the renovation of other notable social housing blocks, such as Ern\u0151 Goldfinger\u2019s Trellick Tower, may preserve the building\u2019s physical form, but they do not conserve their original purpose of providing housing for low-income families. Hatherley argues that if there were a choice between maintaining the use of a housing estate and protecting its architectural value, he would err towards the former: \u201cAt least it is doing this thing that we as a society need. But instead, it is decided that we need architectural trinkets.\u201d\n\nWithin the heritage list there are curious inclusions that hint towards conservation that surpasses architectural value: Paul McCartney and John Lennon\u2019s childhood homes, for example. McCartney\u2019s is a modest 1949 council house of the quality that the postwar Labour government encouraged; Lennon\u2019s a more middle-class dwelling built in 1933, an example of Arts & Crafts-influenced 1930s housing with lead casement windows. Neither would have been protected by a listing had it not been for their residents, but this good fortune means examples of more \u201cordinary\u201d housing \u2014 arguably every bit as important to our social and architectural history as grand villas and churches \u2014 have been conserved.\n\nThe Beatles\u2019 homes are examples of what Leanne Tritton, one of the founders of the campaign group Don\u2019t Waste Buildings, called \u201cjourneymen buildings\u201d. The group refocuses the question of conservation to something altogether more fundamental \u2014 waste. The thrust of its argument is that if Britain is to meet the 2050 net zero target, it cannot afford to knock down buildings. This is because of embodied carbon; the climate warming emissions that have already been expended in a building\u2019s construction. The UK Green Building Council reports that 20 per cent of the carbon emissions attributed to the built environment in the UK come from embodied carbon.\n\nShould we, therefore, be more stringent with protections? Perhaps not on a basis of architectural merit but of environmental conservation. Demolishing a leaky old house and replacing it with a highly insulated one is not necessarily a net gain for the environment: the carbon emissions that went into the original building\u2019s creation are essentially wasted.\n\n\u201cHistoric societies are really good at protecting historic buildings but Don\u2019t Waste Buildings is about the unloved,\u201d says Tritton. \u201cIt just makes no sense to pull them down unless you absolutely have to.\u201d The Don\u2019t Waste Buildings campaign presents a new way to approach old buildings which is at once more revolutionary and more pragmatic \u2014 it hopes \u2014 than the current one.\n\nWhen facing down the challenge of updating ageing housing stock, one could be forgiven for seeing the wealth of heritage buildings in Britain as a burden. Or protecting their architecture as an obstacle. But perhaps the answer lies in seeing the historic built environment as a starting point for modernisation: heritage not as holding back the future, but its foundation.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow @ft_houseandhome on Instagram", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/80b2b5eb-a751-4d07-bd97-6575b366f052"}}, {"id": "538b9890-d414-4555-8b8c-fc2a681dfedf", "event_name": "Striding out with the new breed of Gen-Z walking groups", "blurb": "Driven by social media, sobriety and a search for community, young people are hitting the footpaths", "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0", "body": "It\u2019s a cold January afternoon in Kent, patches of snow still on the ground despite bright sunshine. On the North Downs Way, just outside Sevenoaks and 20 miles from the centre of London, a dog-walker pauses and steps to one side of the narrow, muddy path to make space for a group of young people coming the other way. But a strange thing happens. As the man and the dog wait, the people just keep coming \u2014 two or three abreast, all seemingly in their 20s, smiling and chatting animatedly as they pour out of the woods along the path, a gregarious Gen-Z column almost 400-people strong.\n\nThough he didn\u2019t know it, the man was witnessing the latest outing of Overground, one of a new breed of walking groups that is taking an activity previously associated with sedate middle-age and reinventing it for a Gen-Z and millennial audience. Information is shared on TikTok and Instagram, and the groups often meet in the Home Counties or within a short train ride of other major cities.\n\nFor many of the organisers, it\u2019s about building community, harnessing the mental-health benefits of spending time in nature, encouraging participation from under-represented groups and getting away from hectic city lives. And for an increasingly sober demographic, the early starts on weekend mornings are no problem.\n\nBefore starting their hiking group Dykes Who Hike in March 2024, neither Lucy Cooper nor Yas Message had been big hikers. \u201cWe wanted to see more of the countryside whilst making new connections. . . without relying on alcohol,\u201d says Cooper.\n\nWhen the pair advertised their first hike on social media, the \u201cSeven Sisters walk\u201d from Seaford to Eastbourne, 60 people turned up. When 250 turned up for their second, they realised they might need to formalise a ticketing system to avoid hikes becoming \u201ctoo intimidating for people to enjoy\u201d. Tickets now cost \u00a32, and all 200 spaces typically sell out in minutes; in the past year, new branches have sprouted in Manchester, Leeds, Shropshire and Birmingham.\n\nLast weekend I joined another new group, the Adventure Girls Club, meeting up with 12 women and two dogs at Bath station for a foray into the Downs. \u201cThe [traditional] hiking community can often focus on hiking the farthest, fastest or the most challenging route,\u201d says the group\u2019s founder Alice Keegan, \u201cwhereas I love to hike slowly, take in the views, notice the nature around me \u2014 a more mindful approach.\u201d\n\nKeegan, a qualified mountain leader, used to live in London\u2019s bustling Bethnal Green and work as creative director of a design agency catering to the music industry. Feeling burnt out, she took herself solo hiking in the Lake District and began to appreciate how beneficial the outdoors was for her mental health. Now she wants to support others to \u201cescape the stress of modern living\u201d.\n\nWe file out of town and wind up steep woodland footpaths towards Sham Castle, built in 1762 for Ralph Allen, one of the key figures in Bath\u2019s Georgian revival. As we meander through Smallcombe Wood, Keegan points out species of fungi including the frills of a turkey tail, and the black bulbs of King Alfred\u2019s cakes.\n\nBut if connecting with nature is a key obsession, it is the digital world that is enabling these new communities. Lauren La Faci, TikTok\u2019s London-based consumer communications lead, says that \u201cin recent months, hiking enthusiasts have been captivating millions with stunning landscapes and hiking tutorials\u201d. On the platform, #hiking has 5mn posts (and #hiketok has 270,000). In comparison, #swimming manages 2.1mn posts.\n\nFor Jeb Jagne, who founded Overground in July 2023, \u201cwalking became a way of taking a breather and a way to decompress\u201d after suffering a bereavement, relationship breakup and job loss within the course of a few months. Overground hosts monthly walks within an hour\u2019s train journey of the capital. On their first, 43 people showed up; now there can be as many as 500.\n\nThe walks are free and non-ticketed which means the organisers can\u2019t limit numbers. \u201cThere are already so many barriers when it comes to finding space in the outdoors, I wouldn\u2019t want to introduce another one,\u201d says Jagne. Overground is now fundraising to set up a training programme for people from marginalised groups to become mountain guides.\n\nJagne, who previously worked as a DJ and nightclub promoter, has been sober for the past year. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people meet at Overground and form solid friendships, move into new homes and even go on holiday together. The walks will always be our North Star but what really matters is being that first domino in forming a new connection.\u201d\n\nBack in Bath, 13km trodden and legs aching, the Adventure Girls Club troops back to the train station. The group splits, exchanging social-media contacts and \u201cnice to meet you\u2019s\u201d, returning to suburbia with new friendships forged \u2014 if a little muddier than four hours earlier.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/57e944be-a071-437f-8785-80b8d8c8ee3c"}}, {"id": "e907d42b-2def-45ad-8531-16229d8ea477", "event_name": "New donations to FT charity appeal to be match-funded after deadline extended", "blurb": "Rosetrees Trust will match gifts to help reach new \u00a3200,000 target", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "Thanks to your generosity, the FT\u2019s joint seasonal appeal in aid of Financial Literacy and Inclusion Campaign \u201cFLIC\u201d and school food charity Magic Breakfast has now reached its baseline target of raising \u00a3100,000.\n\nThe appeal, which was launched in early December, was due to close at the end of this week.

But London-based Andy, 79, is not one of them. He and his wife do not plan to leave their four adult children an inheritance. Instead, the couple have spent what\u2019s left of their funds, sailing and travelling the world before they \u201cpop their clogs\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about equality of opportunity and fairness.

A Hargreaves Lansdown survey in 2021 found around 11 per cent of parents in England choose not to leave an inheritance to their families.\u00a0(In Scotland, there are \u201cforced heirship\u201d rules.)\n\nTheir motivations range from hedonism (wanting to spend the money themselves), not wanting to spoil their children, or philanthropy. Others \u2014 such as actor Daniel Craig \u2014 say they simply find the concept of an inheritance \u201cdistasteful\u201d.\n\nI should mention here that my own parents also belong to this contrarian group. Since as early as I can remember, I\u2019ve known they don\u2019t believe in leaving a large inheritance \u2014 something my dad has spoken publicly about himself. They have instead pledged the overwhelming majority of their wealth to their charity, The Safer Roads Foundation, along with other humanitarian causes.\n\nThe Bank of Mum of Dad has taken excellent care of my sibling and me (including generously paying off our student loans, and allocating funds for a future deposit on a flat \u2014 both immense gifts, and more than many will receive in inheritance). So now, it\u2019s pretty much closed for business.\n\nTo be clear, they haven\u2019t cut us out in anger. Nor are they Marxists \u2014 politically they\u2019re pretty centrist. They simply feel that there are life-saving causes that will benefit from their money more than their two well-educated adult children.\n\nRenaissance philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli once wrote that \u201cA son can bear the loss of his father\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. but the loss of his inheritance may drive him to despair.\u201d For anyone wondering if I\u2019ve succumbed to despondency, fear not: I\u2019m genuinely proud of my parents\u2019 legacy. I feel incredibly fortunate for the support I\u2019ve had during their lifetime. There\u2019s a silver lining too, in that I won\u2019t be at risk of any familial angst once they die (40\u00a0per cent of people report conflict over inheritances).\n\nIf anything, I\u2019m intrigued as to why it\u2019s so provocative, especially among their peers. On the rare occasions that it\u2019s come up, I\u2019ve encountered shock or thinly veiled criticism of my parents. Sometimes I\u2019m met with reassurance that I am in fact in their will and this is a motivational ploy (I checked. If it is a bluff, they\u2019re not breaking the act yet).\n\nAndy also says his friends have been critical of his stance. That\u2019s despite all his children \u201clanding on their feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are horrified,\u201d he says. \u201cThat includes my well-balanced friends\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009They can\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nOnline forums froth with furious commentators wondering how people can \u201cwatch their kids living in a \u2018hole\u2019 while they go and enjoy their cruises.\u201d Anonymous op-eds voice dismay over parents \u201cselfishly\u201d spending their inheritance. There is near delirium each time a member of the super-rich \u2014 including Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg \u2014 publicly vows not to leave their wealth to their offspring. Sure, there\u2019s being charitable, they say, but to such extremes?\n\nFundamentally, wanting to shrink your children\u2019s inheritance is seen as counter to the primitive desire to protect one\u2019s offspring \u2014 no matter how well off they are. The majority of people are dedicated to hoarding for their family, with more than \u00a3100bn inherited and gifted in the UK alone each year, according to Demos, a think-tank.\n\n\u201cTaking care of the kids is the cultural norm. So it\u2019s countercultural if you will,\u201d says psychology professor Janet Reibstein and author of Good Relations. \u201cIt\u2019s seen as neglecting the natural role of parent and child.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a luxury itself to contemplate trimming your will, given many families are scared they won\u2019t get a choice amid rising social costs. Fewer than 30 per cent of Brits expect to benefit \u2014 or have benefited from \u2014 an inheritance, according to a 2022 YouGov poll. The ONS reported that the median inheritance for those who received one was \u00a311,000 (this excludes lifetime gifts), and on average occurs in one\u2019s 60s.\n\nIndeed, political interventions that limit the wealth that\u2019s passed down tend to\u00a0spark controversy, including recent reforms to UK inheritance tax (IHT), often described as \u201cBritain\u2019s most hated tax\u201d. Today, around 4 per cent\u00a0of estates are affected by IHT \u2014\u00a0charged at 40 per cent\u00a0on any part of an estate worth over \u00a3325,000 (or over \u00a31mn\u00a0when a main residence is passed down to children and reliefs are pooled with a spouse). The decision to include pension wealth within the scope of IHT from 2027 has come under fire from some corners of the media, while ending the exemption of agricultural property from IHT caused farmers to march on Downing Street.\n\nInheritance naysayers have a simple argument: lots of money isn\u2019t always the best thing for us. It can damage people \u2014 and wealthy kids need specific guardrails, a theory exposed by the Carnegie Conjecture, which holds that people receiving a substantial inheritance are much more likely to leave the workforce. The party line is that guardrails are crucial, whether parents are handing over life-changing amounts or just a generous leftover that might ease their children\u2019s paths.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s tough love.\n\nJoe Reilly, an adviser to US family offices and host of The Inheritance Podcast, says too much money is a real concern.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a source of anxiety for parents, knowing their children are growing up in affluence\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It can impede their search for internal meaning,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cWealth doesn\u2019t have to deprive motivation, but getting rid of all the challenges does.\u201d\n\nSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says hyper-successful entrepreneurs in particular want their children to make their own way (though this is softened with substantial gifts during their parents\u2019 lifetime).\n\nPart of the issue, according to Reilly, is that inheritance was historically reserved for the aristocratic class, who would reserve \u201ca lot of time and effort\u201d learning to adapt to a big wealth influx, including focusing on public service \u2014 though many still squandered it. Today, inheritance comes to broad swaths of the middle class, who have little or no training.\n\nReceiving a hefty inheritance can come with real baggage, says author Eliza Filby. In her book, Inheritocracy she cites several examples of people who inherited large sums who felt guilt, and a loss of meaning. There\u2019s a danger of \u201ceconomically infantilising\u201d your offspring too, she says, especially in light of the \u201cnepo baby\u201d debate.\n\nTo counter this, family office adviser Elena Nu\u00f1ez Cooper works with clients to adopt a policy of \u201csevere responsibility\u201d with their children. This includes teaching them tough financial lessons from a young age and training them to be philanthropists. It also means managing rich people\u2019s funds so they \u201cdie with zero\u201d, with the majority allocated to a charitable foundation \u2014 ideally led by their conscientious, financially savvy children.\n\n\u201cKids do not benefit from an attitude of \u2018you\u2019re going to inherit later\u2019,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez says. \u201cI work with the children of billionaires who have everything, and they\u2019re a lot worse off in the long run.\u201d\n\nFor parents it can be a big ideological step to consider trimming their children\u2019s or grandchildren\u2019s inheritance instead of boosting it \u2014 even if they are well set up.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps an even tougher pill to swallow for the offspring expecting to receive a chunky inheritance, says financial psychotherapist Vicky Reynal. \u201cWe all have a normal amount of greed,\u201d she says. \u201cMost people want to be wealthier.\u201d\n\nThe framing around cuts in inheritance is therefore key. This includes \u201chighlighting that it has nothing to do with not loving or caring about them,\u201d Reynal notes. Their responses may vary depending on the individual\u2019s maturity and how early on these expectations are set.\n\nProfessor Reibstein goes further. She says that families where there\u2019s little philanthropic precedent will need to work hard to rewrite their \u201cculture\u201d if they want to take this route \u2014 otherwise, \u201cyour children will feel it as a blow.\u201d\n\nHargreaves Lansdown analyst Cooper stresses that it doesn\u2019t have to be all or nothing. Simply, leaving your kids everything doesn\u2019t have to be the default.\n\n\u201cYou can think about giving them comfort without spoiling them,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of adding to their quality of life versus taking away the impetus to work.\u201d\n\nWhatever route you choose, however, experts agree: communicate your wishes early. Emotionally, being disinherited without being told can be devastating. But the other danger, Cooper says, is people can be in for a financial shock when an expected inheritance doesn\u2019t materialise.\n\n\u201cYou absolutely cannot rely on an inheritance,\u201d she warns.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to escape the fact that for many an inheritance can make an outsized difference, especially in light of rising house prices \u2014 the average first-time buyer deposit in London is now over \u00a3140,000, according to Zoopla \u2014 and diminished pensions. That includes segments of the middle class, many of whom are poorer than their parents. Inheritance is bridging that intergenerational gap, says Filby.\n\n\u201cWhether or not you\u2019re from a wealthy family\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[inheritance] is more important in determining your lifetime income than it has been in the past,\u201d says David Sturrock at the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nThe IFS forecasts inheritance will make up a record average 14 per cent of lifetime earnings for the 1980s-born generation. That means for some families, an inheritance will dictate whether they own a house, clear their debts, or can retire comfortably, Sturrock explains. In rare cases, it could be a pathway to social mobility.\n\nYet few born into the top quartile can make that argument. Statistically, most adult children in this camp will enter their 40s with a decent income and firmly on the housing ladder \u2014 often funded by historic parental gifts. A bulky inheritance in this group\u2019s case has been described as insurance against calamity, or laziness.\n\nFor Andy, this is precisely the problem.\n\nHis advice is to think about inheritance as a sporting analogy. Imagine, he says, if there was a rule in F1 whereby if you won the first race, you\u2019d do five fewer laps in the next race. You\u2019d probably win again, and allowed five fewer laps again, and so on.\n\nThat\u2019s what leaving an inheritance does to our society, he argues.\n\nI temper that people might struggle to take affirmative action when they see all the other kids getting to skip five laps. Isn\u2019t it hard to make yours the odd ones out?\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI just say, you should have brought them up better then.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e263c674-ab41-4743-bbd3-1718aeeea79b"}}, {"id": "d79ae84c-0762-45cb-af8b-52b6bee564ad", "event_name": "How five years of Brexit reshaped Britain", "blurb": "Starmer\u2019s \u2018reset\u2019 with EU could reduce friction and improve relations for some sectors of society", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "Five years after the UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, the country is still adjusting to life outside the bloc.\n\nBrexit has strained small businesses more than big ones, changed university campuses and the NHS, and contributed to a three-way fracture in the British political firmament following a post-Brexit surge in legal migration.\n\nWith Sir Keir Starmer committed to a \u201creset\u201d of relations with the EU, how far could his negotiations with Brussels change life in Britain?\n\nOne of the EU\u2019s central demands is the introduction of a youth mobility scheme that would restore the right to pay \u201chome fees\u201d of \u00a39,535 a year for EU students at UK universities.\n\nThe UK government is firmly resisting this, not least because it would put financial pressure on cash-strapped universities. The sector is reliant on overseas students who typically pay two or three times domestic rates.\n\nOfficial data shows a more than 50 per cent drop in new EU students after Brexit, while universities increased recruitment from other markets in Asia and Africa, including India, Nigeria and Pakistan.\n\nBoris Johnson promised in 2020 that his Brexit deal would not interrupt the \u201cva-et-vient\u201d of people-to-people contacts with the EU, but in practice the intake of UK universities has shifted substantially.\n\nJamie Arrowsmith, director of Universities UK International, which represents the industry, said the changes had brought greater diversity to British campuses, but had narrowed the field of subjects studied as international students tended to favour science and business studies courses.\n\n\u201cWhile the diversity in terms of country of origin has changed, diversity in courses has been lost,\u201d he added.\n\nBrexit also saw the introduction of a points-based immigration system by Johnson\u2019s government from January 1 2021 that coincided with a massive expansion of the NHS workforce, necessitating far more overseas recruitment.\n\nMark Dayan, policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said that a government decision to lower thresholds for medical workers had led to a radical reshaping of the NHS workforce.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2023 the number of ethnic minority doctors in the NHS grew at almost 8 times the rate of white doctors, according to the General Medical Council, with arrivals from India, Pakistan, Egypt, Nigeria and the Philippines rising sharply.\n\nDayan said the challenge of integrating doctors who trained overseas into the NHS was one reason why an increase in staff numbers in recent years had not delivered a commensurate increase in productivity.\n\n\u201cAbsorbing so many new staff, many at [the] start of their careers, who are used to a different system of working, requires a lot of work on training, and introducing them to how things are done in the NHS,\u201d Dayan said.\n\nThe government is planning to train more UK doctors as well as continuing to recruit from abroad, but its red lines on free movement of workers mean that it is unlikely that EU-UK reset negotiations will see a significant increase in recruitment from the EU.\n\nBrexit was sold during the 2016 referendum campaign as the means by which the UK would \u201ctake back control\u201d of its borders, curbing both legal and illegal migration.\n\nIn the event, both surged after 2020, fuelling accusations of betrayal on the political right and helping to drive support for Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK party, which has recently drawn level with both Labour and the Conservatives in the polls.\n\nThis political splintering is the opposite of what former Tory premier David Cameron intended when he called the referendum to head off the threat posed by Farage\u2019s UK Independence Party and resolve long-standing divisions over Europe inside the Conservative party.\n\nBut Reform\u2019s rise has come despite a decline in the overall popularity of Brexit, with 58 per cent of voters now saying Brexit was the wrong decision, according to polling by the National Centre for Social Research.\n\nA \u201ckey element\u201d of this shift, according to pollster Sir John Curtice, is driven by demographic trends as older, pro-Brexit voters die off and younger voters, who were unable to vote in 2016, express their overwhelming pro-EU views.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the demographics story, the ceiling for a Farage party should be lower than 10 years ago, but Reform is more popular in 2024 than Ukip was in 2014,\u201d said Rob Ford, professor of politics at Manchester University.\n\nFord credited this counter-intuitive outcome to the platform Brexit gave Farage, and to the political opportunity offered to him by the Tories\u2019 struggle to deliver benefits from the UK\u2019s break with the EU.\n\nThe past few years have laid bare Brexit\u2019s damaging impact on business. Countries usually strike trade deals to reduce border bureaucracy, but the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement did the reverse, restoring the customs requirements that had disappeared with the advent of the EU single market.\n\nLabour has said it will not rejoin a customs union with the EU or go back into the EU single market, so trade will continue to face customs barriers.\n\nStarmer\u2019s negotiations with the EU could reduce friction for some individual sectors, such as food and drink exporters, if Labour makes good on its promise to strike a veterinary agreement with Brussels.\n\nAligning industrial standards and relinking the EU and UK carbon trading schemes could also reduce other forms of red tape, such as licensing requirements and carbon border adjustment taxes, or CBAMs.\n\nHowever a mountain of paperwork will remain. In 2023, the last year for which data is available, there were more than 41mn customs declarations for trade between the UK and the EU. The much criticised Brussels red tape became \u2018red white and blue\u2019 tape.\n\nAs a result, UK goods exports underperformed other rich-world countries, with the total value rising by just 0.3 per cent per year, compared with 4.2 per cent annually across the OECD, according to the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank.\n\nNew Brexit red tape has hit small businesses hardest, with research by the London School of Economics calculating that 16,400 firms stopped exporting to the EU after the TCA came into force.\n\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce said smaller companies had less capacity to deal with \u201cthe deluge\u201d of new bureaucracy, while larger businesses had the money and staff to adapt.\n\n\u201cExporting to the EU was often a gateway for SMEs to enter new export markets across the world, so the urgency of making border processes cheaper and simpler is clear,\u201d he added.\n\nThe BCC has urged the government to use the reset negotiations to simplify border processes and promote regulatory co-operation on customs matters, particularly as the bloc introduces new rules in the coming years.\n\nChris Southworth, secretary-general of the International Chamber of Commerce, said that given the UK\u2019s red lines the government should invest in digitising trade, using AI and improving access to trade finance in order to help business.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need TCA for any of this and it will improve EU co-operation and repair some of the damage,\u201d he added.\n\nPoll tracker by Jonathan Vincent", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4d2d78b0-eedd-485c-9a9c-4e41baf46146"}}, {"id": "8d7e6c8b-d77f-4884-87a3-e90e283e468e", "event_name": "AstraZeneca ditches plan to build \u00a3450mn UK vaccine plant", "blurb": "Decision is a blow to Starmer\u2019s government after setting out pro-growth pitch to investors ", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "AstraZeneca has cancelled plans for a \u00a3450mn UK vaccine manufacturing plant after months of wrangling with British officials about state support for the project, in a major blow to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s government.\n\nUK officials put forward a revised offer of financial support for the site close to Liverpool this month that was significantly higher than the \u00a340mn offered last year, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nStarmer\u2019s Labour government had initially sought last summer to reduce the amount of public money provided to the project in Speke from about \u00a390mn to \u00a340mn.\n\n\u201cFollowing protracted discussions with the government, we are no longer pursuing our planned investment at Speke,\u201d AstraZeneca said in a statement on Friday.\n\n\u201cSeveral factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government\u2019s proposal.\u201d\n\nThe new plant was going to make the next generation of flu vaccines and help the UK be more resilient in future pandemics.\n\nThe existing Speke site will continue to produce and supply a flu vaccine, said AstraZeneca, the largest UK-listed company by market capitalisation.\n\nThe decision comes just days after chancellor Rachel Reeves sought to position the UK as a highly attractive place for life science companies to invest in a major speech on growth.\n\nStarmer and Reeves have faced criticism from business for their \u00a340bn tax-raising Budget last year and other measures including stronger worker rights, which executives have warned will make the UK a less attractive place to invest.\n\nThe UK\u2019s previous offer to the pharmaceutical group under former Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt included up to \u00a370mn in grants to develop an existing AstraZeneca vaccine facility at Speke, as well as \u00a320mn in research and development support from the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nHunt, who announced the deal to great fanfare in March of last year, told the Financial Times that AstraZeneca\u2019s decision was a \u201cmassive own goal by the government\u201d.\n\n\u201cManufacturing high-end vaccines is a huge opportunity for us to move away from over-dependence on the R&D part of the value chain,\u201d he said. \u201cI intervened personally to get this deal over the line in 2023 and am mortified the government has dropped the ball on it.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury said: \u201cA change in the make-up of the investment originally proposed by AstraZeneca led to a reduced government grant offer being put forward.

Sadly there is clear evidence to support his case \u2014 from attempts to monitor \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d to shocking attempts to suppress the views of gender critical academics such as Kathleen Stock and Jo Phoenix.\n\nGoodwin is angry about hostility he himself has encountered because of his support for the populist right and has made a journey from university academic (until last year he was professor of politics at the University of Kent) to political activist. But his anger gets in the way of analysing the convergence on the university system of a range of very different forces.\n\nFirst is the intellectual climate, itself shaped by universities. They are where critical theory began and flourished. It is a theory which appeals to academics because it says that words matter: language is a tool of oppression. So our language and the curriculum have to be decolonised in order truly to deliver diversity, equity and inclusion. It is an agenda far removed from classic concerns of the left such as what people earn and what access they have to public services. And there is another crucial difference. There were always left-wing academics \u2014 as well as some of a more conservative disposition. But the university as an institution was not engaged in their arguments and did not take a view. Now there are universities, especially but not only in America, where advocates of critical theory have recruited university administrators who use university-wide EDI programmes to advance their agenda and try to require academics to comply.\n\nSecondly there is the intense transgender debate, exacerbated in the UK by misinterpretation of the Equality Act. Too many universities, perhaps influenced by the LGBTQ+ rights charity Stonewall, interpreted the Act to mean any form of self-identified gender is a protected characteristic. The Reindorf review of problems at the University of Essex is a clear and authoritative account of serious mistreatment of academics as a result. Since it was published in 2021 no British university should repeat such behaviour.\n\nThe third trend is how students are changing. The psychologists Jean Twenge and Jonathan Haidt have persuasively argued that the rise in access to social media is leading to mental health issues for young people. This can lead to the introduction of trigger warnings and a belief that freedom of speech is less important than protecting people\u2019s feelings. However, higher education appears to provide some resilience to these pressures, lowering the risk of young people withdrawing from work because of mental illness.\n\nThere is a class divide too. Young white working-class men are even less likely to go to university than many ethnic minority groups. We should encourage more to go. The real luxury belief is advantaged graduates saying there is no point going to university when for many young people from disadvantaged backgrounds it is the most powerful tool of social mobility we\u2019ve got. For those who were previously on free school meals, average graduate earnings growth in their first decade is 75 per cent, while for non-graduates it is 26 per cent. But instead of promoting the value of higher education, social mobility advocates have put more weight, probably excessive, on the early years.\n\nThere has also been the shift in attitudes away from globalisation, represented by Trump and Brexit. David Goodhart, cited by Goodwin, makes universities the arch-culprits in his moral divide between citizens of Somewhere or Nowhere. This is particularly hard on universities as most of them have places in their names. They are definitely somewhere and a good thing too. They are very likely to stay rooted in their place even if the big employers move out or the local paper closes down. Towns and cities in the UK such as Chester, Coventry, Worcester or Bournemouth have been revitalised by the emergence of a strong local university. The government may be underestimating the shockwaves if a university closes.\n\nAdd to this mix empowering the student as consumer. The student is not just a consumer, though the university fee is a contract to deliver a service and that strengthens the student voice. Most local student unions don\u2019t want Marxist revolution but to get their academic work back promptly and seminars that are less crowded. But student satisfaction rankings have been given exaggerated weight and empowered students to threaten academics on very different issues.\n\nThere are university leaders who see that all these forces mean they have heavy new responsibilities which they cannot avoid. Universities should be the place where diverse young people learn how to disagree. The 2015 Chicago Statement of the principles of free speech in university is important and Goodwin wants \u201cto force universities, through government action, to sign up\u201d and then to practise what they preach.\n\nHis many anecdotes move between UK and US as if our two university systems are interchangeable. But there are important differences such as greater labour market protections in the UK (and even more in Europe). Protection from unfair dismissal matters if an academic is caught in a social media frenzy. This might explain the paradox that American and to some extent British universities have been far more susceptible to some of these forces than Continental Europe despite their intellectual origins in Continental postmodernist philosophy.\n\nGoodwin wants to use \u201cthe powers of the state to restore justice and balance\u201d. The loss of confidence in the ability of universities to protect freedom of speech justified the 2023 freedom of speech legislation with new powers for the university regulator, which I support. But this is tricky territory.\n\nThe problems began on the morning the previous Conservative government launched the initiative. On the Today programme the minister responsible was asked if this meant Holocaust denial would be protected, and she said yes. Holocaust denial is not itself a legal offence in the UK so her statement made sense for a proper free speech absolutist. Within hours, however, No 10 corrected her: it was not protected under the new legislation. We have never known what this free speech code is that does not permit some legal free speech. We do need stronger protections, but Goodwin doesn\u2019t really engage with the issue of whether there are to be any constraints at all.\n\nThere is a great American tradition of academics worrying that the modern university is rejecting the culture which nurtured it \u2014 William Buckley\u2019s God and Man at Yale, Allan Bloom\u2019s\u00a0The Closing of the American Mind, and now Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt\u2019s The Coddling of the American Mind. In Britain we have tended to express our anxieties instead through the campus novel, a genre of which we are masters. Malcolm Bradbury\u2019s The History Man skewers a certain sort of progressive academic with more skill and subtlety than Goodwin manages. Goodwin has some genuine grievances but he mashes different problems up together and then calls it all a row between right and left \u2014 if only it were so simple.\n\nBad Education: Why Our Universities Are Broken and How We Can Fix Them by Matt Goodwin Bantam \u00a320, 256 pages\n\nDavid Willetts is a former Conservative Minister for Universities and Science and is author of \u2018A University Education\u2019 (OUP)\n\nJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Caf\u00e9 and follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/500b66b1-f044-422e-bf62-e7350ef9ba6b"}}, {"id": "4066404a-c014-4669-865c-633cbc2689e4", "event_name": "UK house prices rise less than expected in January", "blurb": "Mortgage lender Nationwide says affordability \u2018remains stretched\u2019", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "UK house price growth slowed more than expected in January as mortgage rates ticked up and affordability remained stretched, mortgage lender Nationwide said.\n\nThe average house price rose to \u00a3268,213, up 0.1 per cent from the previous month and 4.1 per cent year on year \u2014 less than the annual rise of 4.7 per cent recorded in December.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected a monthly rise of 0.3 per cent and an annual rise of 4.3 per cent.\n\nThe slower than expected house price growth was \u201cnot too surprising given the rise in quoted mortgage rates at the end of last year\u201d, said Alex Kerr, economist at the consultancy Capital Economics.\n\nSeparate data from the Bank of England on Thursday showed that mortgage interest rates rose in December, with the average rate for a two-year fixed mortgage with a 60 per cent loan-to-value ratio rising to 4.47 per cent, up from 4.39 per cent in November and 4.21 per cent in October.\n\nThe average rate was well below its 6.22 per cent peak in the summer of 2023, but up from 1.1 per cent in mid-2021, meaning mortgage affordability remained stretched.\n\nThe BoE is expected to announce a quarter percentage point cut in interest rates to 4.5 per cent on Thursday. Markets are pricing three rate cuts throughout this year.\n\nMark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: \u201cWith the Bank of England expected to reduce interest rates next week, the outlook for borrowers is looking up.\u201d\n\nExperts say house prices are also being supported by a potential increase in demand ahead of the expiry of a recent stamp duty holiday. From April, first-time buyers, for example, will start paying the levy for properties worth \u00a3300,000 or more, instead of \u00a3425,000 at present.\n\nNationwide reported improving housing affordability last year in part thanks to wage growth.\n\nHowever, a prospective buyer earning the average UK income and buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20 per cent deposit would still have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 36 per cent of their take-home pay \u2014 well above the long-run average of 30 per cent.\n\nFurthermore, house prices remain high relative to average earnings, with the first-time buyer house price-to-earnings ratio standing at 5.0 at the end of 2024, still well above the long-run average of 3.9.\n\nRobert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, said the market had shown resilience \u201cdespite ongoing affordability pressures\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile there has been a modest improvement over the last year, affordability remains stretched by historic standards,\u201d he said.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e804b318-dae4-4428-8a62-8cc0642b1335"}}, {"id": "593e0fa1-ccba-44a3-a22a-55762d6400c8", "event_name": "The Big Question: would you trust a driverless car?", "blurb": "Despite the potential for safer roads, polls suggest public trust in automated vehicles is falling", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "Driverless cars were once something we used to watch in sci-fi movies.

The data for driverless cars is less forgiving, partially because there is so little of it.\n\nNevertheless, Musk, head of the new Department of Government Efficiency, is gearing up for a step-change. On Wednesday, he announced plans to start production of a fleet of autonomous taxis, known as \u201ccybercabs\u201d, in 2026. But his enthusiasm contrasts sharply with public sentiment.\n\nMany US drivers have expressed reservations about fully driverless technology. The share of US drivers who say they are \u201cafraid\u201d of automated cars has risen from 54 in 2021 to 66 per cent in 2024, while trust has dropped from 14 per cent to 9 per cent in 2024.\n\nThere may be less evidence that driverless cars are dangerous, but there is little evidence that it is any safer than the human alternative.\n\nSo what do you think?\u00a0Are driverless cars safer than those driven by humans?

It was enough space to create a jewel-box garden studded with clipped yew and beech topiary, exquisite borders, an ornamental kitchen garden and swaths of meadows that were gently and patiently coaxed back from scrubland.\n\nBut the 15th-century house, which sits in a deep basin with pasture and woodland rising up around it, had originally been part of a much larger estate of 160 acres. In 2022 this \u201clost\u201d land \u2014 the largest single Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in Wales \u2014 became available to buy. \u201cIt always felt like we were connected to the landscape,\u201d says Maynard. \u201cBut bringing the land back in ownership with the house \u2014 all of a sudden, the house had a completely different feel and a different purpose. It was like a divorce that we reunited.\u201d\n\nThe land had been largely unmanaged, which meant an enormous variety of wild flowers had flourished \u2014 but so too had pernicious weeds. \u201cMost of the land was covered with brambles and bracken, some of it to chest height,\u201d explains Collinson, who first had to repeatedly flail the land to clear it, a process they had already carried out on the wild-flower meadows. \u201cThe pastures regenerated quickly, and the bank of wild flowers in those areas which we\u2019ve uncovered has been fantastic. We have huge quantities of orchids. They\u2019re just everywhere. You can\u2019t step on to the pastures without standing on an orchid.\u201d\n\nPart of the management plan set out by Natural Resources Wales \u2014 who oversee the SSSI designation \u2014 was that the land should be grazed properly, and that provided Collinson with the opportunity to realise a long-held dream. He\u2019s descended from a long line of farmers \u2014 his maternal ancestors had farmed a block of land on the Somerset Levels since the Domesday.\n\nThey acquired a small herd of White Park cattle in 2022. It\u2019s an ancient breed \u2014 its distinctive head, with long elegant horns, has been the logo of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust since its inception in 1973, when there were only around 65 breeding females of White Park left; there are around 750 today. It\u2019s widely considered to be the most ancient British breed, descended from the country\u2019s original wild white cattle and prized for its hardy nature. For the novice farmer, this was a key consideration, since the herd can happily live outside year round.\n\nBut the White Park is also valued for its excellent foraging abilities and gentle grazing, making it the perfect breed for coaxing back the land, clearing overgrown patches and opening it up in \u201ca completely natural way\u201d. Once the process of clearing patches begins, the cows then go in and forage to fully clear it, exposing the soil and, at the same time, exposing the seed bank, allowing native wild flowers to grow and kick-starting a regenerative cycle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see how the land is improving, to see how the land has become different during the period of our ownership. You can see quite clearly how our pasture is different,\u201d says Maynard. The grasses on their land are all native, in contrast with modern hybrid grasses used on many nearby farms. \u201cPastures owned by farmers who farm more intensively and fertilise look completely different. Ours feels medieval.\u201d\n\nAs well as a sea of orchids, including the common spotted orchid and southern marsh orchid, the land is now rich with wild flowers including cardamine, knapweed, cranesbills, yarrow, vetch, buttercups, sorrel and betony. Abundant birdlife has followed, including nightingales in summer.\n\nThe White Park herd roams between pasture and woodland, allowing it to self-medicate with herbs and wild flowers, and to eat bark from hazel and fruit trees. \u201cIn the old days, farmers used to cut green branches to feed the cattle and they would graze off all the lower leaves,\u201d says Maynard. \u201cThey might kill off the young bark of hazel, but there\u2019s this whole ecosystem that starts to happen.\u201d\n\nConservation grazing has grown substantially over the past 15 to 20 years says Christopher Price, chief executive of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. In the charity\u2019s latest watchlist rare breeds including Dartmoor sheep, New Forest ponies, saddleback pigs and native goat breeds are among those increasing in number. It\u2019s a welcome return. \u201cThe landscapes and habitats that we cherish were largely created by wild or semi-feral grazing animals,\u201d says Price.\n\nMaynard and Collinson currently have 13 cows. Caring for the herd has, says Collinson, been a daily adventure, everything from dealing with the grisly fallout from a broken horn (\u201cshocking in the extreme\u201d) to the awe of the first calves being born last spring. The cows take themselves off to find a hollow or dense copse where they give birth alone, before calling for the rest of the herd, who then form a protective cr\u00e8che for the new addition.\n\n\u201cEvery day I\u2019m learning something new,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey are quite docile, quite friendly, but terribly strong. You can rub their noses, and they\u2019ll eat out of your hand. And I know them well, but they\u2019re also wilful.

Those caught will face up to 14 years in prison.\n\nChris Philp, shadow home secretary, said the bill \u201conly engages in minor tinkering\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that won\u2019t stop the boats\u201d.\n\nWhile most of the former government\u2019s Illegal Migration Act, which blocked anyone arriving via small boats from claiming asylum in the UK, is set to be repealed, several of its provisions are being maintained.\n\nThese include a ban on migrants claiming protection under modern slavery laws, the power to detain children for up to 28 days, and a cap on the number of people who can come to the UK via safe and legal routes.\n\nWhile the legislation is primarily targeted at those in the UK who are involved in facilitating people-smuggling operations, it also gives the government powers to criminalise people who have been involved in activities overseas, including supplying inflatable boats.\n\nOfficials confirmed that the government could use existing powers to extradite foreign criminals to the UK so they can face charges for crimes under the new legislation, which is expected to pass into law by the end of the year.\n\nThey said that the goal of the legislation is to disrupt criminal gangs and ultimately reduce the number of people arriving on small boats to the UK.\n\nAbout 37,000 people came to Britain via small vessels in 2024, a rise of a quarter on the 29,500 who arrived in 2023.\n\nPeople briefed on internal calculations said the Ministry of Justice estimated the new powers and offences would result in about 100 extra people being sent to prison each year,\n\nColin Yeo, an immigration barrister, said that while the legislation could theoretically result in that number of arrests, \u201cit seems highly unlikely that would actually reduce arrivals\u201d of migrants by small boats.\n\n\u201cProsecuting people smugglers who never set foot on British soil is impossible and more would spring up to meet demand anyway,\u201d he said.\n\nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, praised the government for repealing much of the previous government\u2019s legislation \u2014 including its scheme to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda \u2014 saying it had \u201caverted a meltdown, cutting delays and preventing higher hotel costs\u201d.\n\nHowever, he said he was \u201cvery concerned that, by creating new offences, many refugees themselves could also be prosecuted\u201d, which would be \u201ca gross miscarriage of justice\u201d.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b6837899-dd2e-48f9-8173-6b907e42082c"}}, {"id": "69ec2e82-205b-4b7d-b29c-49d157840581", "event_name": "NHS mental health and dementia targets axed in planned overhaul   ", "blurb": "Campaigners warn changes send message that conditions do not matter ", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "The UK government has been accused of \u201cdeprioritising\u201d mental health after a number of NHS targets were scrapped under a planned overhaul.\n\nHospital bosses in England will be judged against far fewer targets under updated annual guidance published on Thursday, which saw the number of goals pared back from 32 to 18.\n\nHealth secretary Wes Streeting outlined a renewed focus on A&E waiting times and reducing appointment backlogs, but critics have warned that fewer targets means other areas will inevitably be cut.\n\nAxed objectives include ensuring 75 per cent of people with severe mental illness receive a full annual physical health check, and a goal to increase the number of adults completing a course of treatment for anxiety and depression.\n\nMore than 2mn people are on NHS waiting lists for mental health treatments or courses, according to campaigners.\n\nMinisters are still protecting mental health spending, and require NHS trusts to raise investment in mental health in line with overall budget increases.\n\nNew guidance published on Thursday also states that health leaders should seek to reduce average length of stay in adult acute mental health beds and improve access to children and young people\u2019s mental health services.\n\nThe updated document contains fewer \u201cnational priorities\u201d, which are broader NHS goals, but major objectives on A&E waiting times and reducing waiting lists have remained.\n\nAt the heart of the new guidance is a target to ensure 65 per cent of patients on a waiting list for routine hospital care are seen within 18 weeks.\n\nMinisters have vowed that 92 per cent of patients will begin treatment for an ailment \u2014 or get the all-clear within this timeframe \u2014 by the end of the parliament in 2029. This NHS target was last met at the end of 2015.\n\nAndy Bell, chief executive at the Centre for Mental Health, said waiting times are \u201cjust as important\u201d as those for other care.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply disappointed that waiting lists for elective care have been given priority over those for mental healthcare,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that placing these NHS patients on a \u201clower footing\u201d was \u201cunjust\u201d.\n\nSarah Hughes, chief executive of Mind, added: \u201cThe lack of a credible plan to get the 2mn people on mental health waiting lists the help they need, the dropping of key mental health targets, and lack of adequate funding means this government appears to be deprioritising mental health.\u201d\n\nThe dementia diagnosis rate target, which requires 67 per cent of people living with dementia in England to receive a diagnosis, was also scrapped from the guidance.\n\nFiona Carragher, chief policy and research officer for the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, called the decision \u201cunacceptable\u201d and said it \u201csends the message that dementia doesn\u2019t matter\u201d.\n\nThe guidance also calls on NHS organisations to simultaneously \u201creduce their cost base\u201d by at least 1 per cent and achieve 4 per cent improvement in productivity, which health leaders warned would be \u201cunbelievably stretching\u201d for the NHS to achieve.\n\nAn additional target set out on Thursday is for 75 per cent of cancer patients\u00a0to have their first treatment within 62 days, compared with the\u00a0current target of 70 per cent.\n\nStreeting said: \u201cIf everything is a priority, then nothing is. I want to empower NHS leaders to deliver the innovation and reform required to fix the NHS, rather than overload them with targets which have failed to deliver better outcomes for patients.\n\n\u201cThis new approach will see the NHS focus on what matters most to patients \u2014 cutting waiting lists, getting seen promptly at A&E, and being able to get a GP appointment.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9642e988-686f-494d-8244-e6fb2cf0ae5d"}}, {"id": "c855eb45-d6c5-4bad-8c18-5cd9fa6d653d", "event_name": "UK forecasts small role for green airline fuel by 2040 despite Reeves\u2019 claims", "blurb": "Government\u2019s models suggest Sustainable Aviation Fuel will take years to make significant impact", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "Fossil fuels will account for more than three-quarters of fuel used by airlines beyond 2040 \u2014 according to the British government\u2019s own projections \u2014 undermining Rachel Reeves\u2019 claims that new technologies will turn aviation green.\n\nThe UK chancellor said on Thursday that \u201csustainable aviation fuels\u201d are a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in the debate over airport expansion, as she forecast that flights could take off from a new runway at Heathrow by 2035.\n\nReeves has angered environmentalists \u2014 but delighted some business groups \u2014 by encouraging Heathrow\u2019s management to put forward plans for the third runway by this summer, with the hope of achieving planning permission before the next election in 2029.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve asked Heathrow to come forward with plans for that third runway by the summer, and we\u2019ve said that it needs to meet strict rules about environmental and carbon emissions\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I do believe they can. And Heathrow believes that they can as well,\u201d Reeves told the BBC.\n\n\u201cI believe [sustainable aviation fuels] are a game-changer in the way that we fly and the carbon emissions,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the government is only expecting 22 per cent of UK jet fuel to be supplied by SAF by 2040, according to a document dated December 2024.\n\nSAF is made from a diverse range of sources, including crops, used cooking oil, household waste or hydrogen and can emit about 70 per cent less carbon dioxide over its life cycle than traditional aviation fuel.\n\nIt is also much more expensive than traditional jet fuel and is currently only available in small quantities.\n\nThe government in January introduced a mandate that required fuel producers to supply a portion of SAF for flights departing the UK.\n\nThe mandate is for 2 per cent of fuel to be SAF this year and steadily rises to reach 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040.\n\nThe targets are in line with the aviation industry\u2019s road map to reach net zero by 2050, which is heavily reliant on SAF but includes other measures such as more efficient conventional jets and air traffic control management.\n\nBut Tim Johnson, the director of the Aviation Environment Federation, said that under current forecasts the aviation industry would need all the available SAF in the UK in 2035 just to meet the growth in flight numbers from a third runway at Heathrow.\n\n\u201cThis is not just this government having an over-optimistic take on SAF. It is consistent with every government in the world, because falling back on SAF allows them to continue to pursue growth,\u201d he said.\n\nAirlines are concerned that not enough SAF is being produced to hit the government\u2019s targets and some have suggested that the SAF mandates might need to be watered down.\n\nTo help build a homegrown SAF industry, airlines and airports have urged ministers to speed up the rollout of a financial support mechanism to encourage investors to put money into production.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be an alignment between the hugely welcome language around growth and boosting capacity at airports and incentivising the production of SAF,\u201d said Tim Alderslade, chief executive of lobby group Airlines UK.\n\nThe government has outlined plans for an industry-funded \u201crevenue certainty mechanism\u201d, which would guarantee a minimum price for the fuel, similar to schemes used to underwrite nuclear and offshore wind projects.\n\nBut it is not expected to be introduced until the end of next year.\n\nA Government spokesperson said:\u00a0\u201cWe are committed to delivering greener aviation to support our mission to kick-start economic growth and to make Britain a clean energy superpower.\n\n\u201cWe are already making great strides in the path to greener aviation, with new targets for sustainable aviation fuel starting this year. Yesterday we also announced \u00a363 million to boost UK production of sustainable fuels and set out measures to attract investment in in the UK sustainable aviation fuels market.\u201d\n\nNoaman Al Adhami, head of UK at fuel company Alfanar, said he cannot close the financing for a plant to produce more than 130,000 tonnes of SAF a year on Teesside without the guarantees from the government on a revenue certainty mechanism.\n\n\u201cWithout it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to close the project,\u201d he said.\n\nThe previous Tory government\u2019s plan to scale up SAF production called for five refineries to be under construction in the UK by the end of this year. None have been financed or built.\n\nGlobal SAF production volumes reached 1.3bn litres last year and accounted for 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production, according to Iata.\n\nGiven the challenges to scaling up SAF globally, Al Adhami said the UK was still ahead of many other countries, following its introduction of both the mandate and promise of a revenue support mechanism.\n\n\u201cAt least now from a risk perspective and the capital we have invested in the UK, there is more certainty,\u201d he said.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/78c3705d-d484-48ce-adfb-ffc827fc0646"}}, {"id": "0a6943a9-229e-47ff-9abd-2aa630d0828a", "event_name": "The contradictions at the heart of Rachel Reeves\u2019 growth plan ", "blurb": "Red lines hobble the chancellor\u2019s ambitions ", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "Good afternoon on this, the eve of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the week that Rachel Reeves tried to put the rocket-boosters under Labour\u2019s economic growth strategy.\n\nHer upbeat speech in Oxford observed that getting Britain growing again was based on three pillars: political stability, regulatory reform and the combination of private and public investment.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much to disagree with, but because of the damage done by the Budget, it will take more than a sprightly speech for Reeves to dispel the underlying sense that this is a government still struggling to find the \u201cpolitical stability\u201d that is essential if they are to plausibly present themselves as agents of enduring change.\n\nReeves praised MakeUK, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, but reacting to the speech, chief executive Stephen Phipson warned that the government needed to resolve the contradiction between its growth-suppressing Budget and the paper ambitions set out by the chancellor.\n\nAnd therein lies the challenge.\n\nThe headline announcements that the government is backing a third runway at Heathrow, is getting behind the Oxford-Cambridge Arc again and will support the Manchester United regeneration project sends a clear signal to international investors that the UK is \u201copen for business\u201d.\n\nLess clear is whether a government led by a prime minister who is now less popular than Rishi Sunak at his nadir, has the political gumption to make the arguments necessary to deliver on ambitions that will pay relatively slow dividends.\n\nThis is not to be churlish, but to observe that Reeves\u2019 speech was delivered by a chancellor already on the back foot. Last summer this would have sounded like Labour firing the starting gun on its rescue mission for Britain, not a government trying to rescue itself.\n\nNew administrations usually start with an announcements phase followed by a period of delivery and then a recrimination phase when, inevitably, they come up short. This government managed to skip straight to the recrimination phase.\n\nGoodwill hunting\n\nThe bungled Budget has starved the government of goodwill with the public and business community that it badly needs. Because the road ahead will be hard \u2014 there will be opposition to Heathrow, downside risks from deregulation and furious Nimby protests.\n\nThe revival of the OxCam Arc is a case in point. Hitting the high-growth scenarios outlined by Reeves, will require driving through the final section of the East West Rail line from Bedford to Cambridge while building a lot of houses along those tracks in one of the most congested areas of the country.\n\nThe last attempt by the Tories failed because of local opposition. As Local council leaders in Cambridge told me this week \u2014 including the Labour leader of Cambridge City council, Mike Davey \u2014 it\u2019s imperative that this government doesn\u2019t repeat the political mistakes of the last one and lose public goodwill.\n\nAs Lucy Nethsingha, the Liberal Democrat leader of Cambridgeshire county council, put it:\n\nTo put in context the scale of the task. Reeves announced that the Environment Agency had finally cleared the long-delayed 5,400 home new town development at Waterbeach in Cambridge.\n\nBut according to research by Public First for the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster Board seen by the Financial Times, the region will need 15,000 homes a year on average to hit a high-growth trajectory \u2014 that\u2019s a threefold increase above 2023 levels in Greater Cambridge, Oxford and Milton Keynes.\n\nBrexit blues\n\nThe Budget is not the only place where election manifesto red lines have generated policy contradictions that are now hobbling Reeves in her growth mission.\n\nThe chancellor talked about the need for greater investment and trade, but the UK\u2019s \u201creset\u201d with Europe \u2014 which might have convinced investors that the UK was \u201cback\u201d \u2014 is severely limited by the decision to rule out rejoining a customs union or the EU single market.\n\nFive years after the TCA came into force, what is notable is how little anything has changed, despite the change of government.\n\nLabour pledged to \u201ctear down the barriers to trade\u201d with the EU while sticking to the same Tory red lines that created the Tories\u2019 \u201cfailed\u201d Brexit deal \u2014 Reeves\u2019 words, not mine \u2014 in the first place.\n\nThere was some positivity this week when (finally) the UK indicated it would look to relink the UK and EU carbon-pricing schemes and may consider joining the Pan-Euro Mediterranean customs agreement, but like Reeves\u2019 growth plans, for now these are paper commitments.\n\nEU officials now tell my colleagues in Brussels they expect a UK-EU summit \u201cin the first half\u201d of the year. That could be April or June, given the purdah period around local elections in May. The EU then needs to collectively agree a mandate. Don\u2019t expect talks until September or even October.\n\nAnd as the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank observed in its comprehensive survey of the past five years, Labour\u2019s plans for the EU reset, including a veterinary agreement and a deal for creative artists will deliver only marginal reductions in friction.\n\n\u201cWhilst benefiting certain sectors, these proposals would do little to address the overall economic impact of Brexit,\u201d it found.\n\nThe reality, as we reported this week, is that the EU \u201creset\u201d discussion is going nowhere fast, with even the legally non-binding Security Partnership now hung up on the familiar issues of fish and youth mobility, including restoring the rights of EU students to pay \u201chome\u201d fees when they come and study at UK universities.\n\nYou can blame the EU, and the French in particular, for being stuck playing old tunes about \u201cno cherry picking\u201d despite the strategic fears over Ukraine, but in truth the UK has done nothing to really shift the dial or build momentum. It has put no prizes on the table that would make EU member states behave any differently.\n\nAs with the October Budget and business, the government has managed to put itself into the \u201crecrimination phase\u201d with Brussels before it has even announced what it wants. That is a remarkable own-goal.\n\nIn a braver world, Starmer would have done a fast deal on fish (the last government already failed the fishermen) and embraced youth mobility as a cultural and economic opportunity, driving the negotiation with Brussels into a genuinely different place.\n\nIndeed, even very recently, as the Treasury and No 10 went into panic mode over growth, there was a moment to make arguments that going deeper with the EU should be part of the fix, as much as a third runway at Heathrow.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t happen, trapped as the government is by its framing of the problem and the potential opportunity. As one despairing Whitehall insider put it: \u201cIt is eerily reminiscent of 2017. We are now in serious danger of sinking back into a low-ambition doomloop.\u201d\n\nAre you enjoying The State of Britain newsletter?

But at The Dreamery, an otherworldly new wine bar and ice-cream parlour in leafy De Beauvoir Town, north London, they come together magically.\n\nThe pint-sized bar is the work of Alex Young and George de Vos, also the creators of Goodbye Horses, a convivial natural wine bar and restaurant on the same street that proved one of the underground hits of 2024. Around the same time, the pair also launched Day Trip, an artisan coffee shop in the same building. \u201cBoth George and I see creating hospitality venues as creating worlds in themselves,\u201d says Young, who used to work in tech. \u201cWe wanted to create a little village, an ecosystem that has a feeling of escapism.\u201d\n\nIce-cream and wine can be a tricky match from a purely technical point of view, as the sweetness of the former can make the latter taste flat. But whatever nuance is lost in the pairing is far outweighed by the spirit of fun it creates. \u201cOur approach to pairing is rather\u00a0anarchic,\u201d admits Young.\n\nThere\u2019s an improvisational feel to the whole enterprise \u2013 yet there are some significant names behind the scenes. Goodbye Horses was designed by the Swiss architect Leopold Banchini, who also has a permanent installation at the Centre Pompidou. The courtyard garden at Day Trip was created by garden designer Jihae Hwang, who has won several gold medals at the Chelsea Flower Show. Head of wine at Goodbye Horses is Nathalie Nelles, formerly of Noble Fine Liquor. De Vos himself was formerly GM of Brilliant Corners, a music venue and Japanese restaurant in Dalston.\n\nThe Dreamery is housed in an ex-grocer\u2019s shop. There is no sign outside \u2013 just a steamed-up three-paned window filled with animated silhouettes against a wash of colourful lights. The front door looks just like any other on the Victorian terraced street; but then you notice the stoop, which is painted, slightly spookily, with rune-like suns, moons and birds. Inside, it has the bones of an espresso bar \u2013 there are stainless-steel counters and mirrored walls. But the eye is drawn to the ceiling, where a dazzling backlit mural by artist Lucy Stein fills the space with colour. In the corner, a 1980s-style boombox plays whimsical Studio Ghibli scores.\n\nGoodbye Horses chef Jack Coggins makes all the ice-creams, which are chalked up in marker pen on the wall: on\u00a0my visit they included fig leaf, prune & oolong tea, gingerbread and pear and verjus sorbet (\u00a34 per scoop). There\u2019s no printed drinks list, which will irritate some, but\u00a0there\u2019s a small, regularly changing selection of easy-drinking, \u201cglou-glou\u201d wines: sparkling ros\u00e9 moscato; crunchy, red-berry beaujolais served cool; Alsatian riesling and one or two dessert wines (from \u00a37.50 a glass). The emphasis is on natural and low-intervention producers.\n\nI squeeze in at the bar and order a post-prandial scoop of coffee and butterscotch, and a glass of tawny passito moscato by Cascina Cerutti, which is caramelised and nutty; my friend has the fig-leaf ice-cream and a glass of lychee-scented riesling. Both wines have a degree of natural sweetness and so the end result is actually lovely.\n\nThe ice-cream comes in a stemmed steel gelato cup, like you might see in a cartoon.

Rachel Reeves delivered her big speech on growth. It contained a number of measures: some good (the Oxford/Cambridge arc tops that list), some bad (the third runway at Heathrow) and some added to give the list of growth initiatives the appearance of a more even regional distribution (the regeneration of Old Trafford).\n\nSome thoughts on the political implications and challenges of them below.\n\nRachel Reeves announced (or in some cases re-announced) a swath of measures as part of her drive to fix the most alarming chart in British politics.\n\nThis is the biggest subplot to essentially everything else in British politics. Our economic model took a huge hit in the global financial crisis, it hasn\u2019t recovered since, and everything that successive governments have tried to fix the problem hasn\u2019t worked. (And some of the things they have done, Brexit most of all, have actively made the problem worse.)\n\nOur lack of growth makes everything harder, politically speaking. (To make matters worse, despite being an ageing island nation with sluggish economic growth, we completely failed to learn or even show much interest in Japan, a country that managed those challenges rather better than we did.) Because of that, we have seen both main parties electing leaders from their outer flanks \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn in 2017 and Liz Truss in 2022. It is also why no UK prime minister since David Cameron has been re-elected to a second term and why no prime minister since Tony Blair has served two full terms.\n\nThe best and most exciting measure that Rachel Reeves outlined was the government\u2019s revived backing for the Oxford-Cambridge arc, a strategic plan to build transport links and housing between the two science-rich hubs.\n\nThis was not strictly speaking \u201cnew\u201d as Peter Kyle had announced it at the start of the week. The arc has a lot of cross-party support, but it was shelved by Boris Johnson. While his electoral coalition had relatively few voters who would benefit most from the arc, it had an awful lot of people who would have objected to the required extra building.\n\nLabour\u2019s backing for the arc, and the accompanying approval for much-needed infrastructure improvements such as reservoirs, is another signal that the government essentially regards the very rural seats it won for the first time in 2024 as \u201cone-and-done\u201d victories. That approach has some real negative consequences (the cocktail of changes to inheritance tax and other reliefs for agriculture will, I think, have some unwanted consequences and Labour will end up U-turning on them sooner or later). But it also has some great upsides, of which backing the Oxford-Cambridge arc is right at the top.\n\nYou can see the dividing line that Reeves wants here, politically: the Conservatives will be pushed into opposing the development and disruption that investing in the arc involves because of their imperative to compete with the Liberal Democrats in those seats where voters might be resistant to building. And then Labour, Reeves hopes, will be able to say \u201cwell, what you would do differently?\u201d\n\nThe chancellor has also urged Heathrow to fast-track proposals to build a third runway: I am frankly unconvinced by this as, indeed, are much of the cabinet. (Do read this excellent piece on the legal and political hurdles that still remain to its construction here.) In the short term, it feels like a good way for the government to lose friends and alienate people among environmentally-inclined voters. It also sets up a fun game that interviewers will be able to play whenever speaking to anyone in the cabinet or front bench who voted against expansion in 2018, asking what, exactly, in their view has changed. (I really don\u2019t think some overly optimistic wishful thinking about \u201csustainable aviation fuels\u201d is going to cut it on this one.)\n\nMore importantly, given that the government is only going to be able to get away with antagonising its base on so many issues, in terms of its impact on growth and investment, watering down the government\u2019s plans on employment rights gets you far more in terms of business investment and happiness than the third runway.\n\nI saw The Brutalist last night. Personally, I would say: don\u2019t bother. Danny Leigh\u2019s review is exactly right, down to the most damning observation of all, that the film loses its brilliance with the arrival of \u201ca large, dark plot point that, in common with the whole movie, I\u2019ve liked less the more I\u2019ve thought about it\u201d.

But the project is awaiting UK government approval.\n\nXLCC this month received a \u00a320mn investment from SNIB, building on the UK\u2019s National\u00a0Wealth Fund\u2019s earlier initial investment of \u00a320mn, with the option for an extra \u00a367mn as development progresses.\n\nSNIB, which was founded in 2020 as a development bank, had been established to take on more risk and fund start-ups and growth companies in sectors needed to revitalise the Scottish economy, Fidao said.\n\nThe XLCC facility would support about 900 long-term jobs, including more than 200 apprenticeships, with a further 300 project management roles expected to be based in Scotland.\n\nExpanding Scottish ports, Fidao added, was a priority given the significant quaysides expansion needed to assemble the infrastructure for the rollout of more offshore wind farms.\n\nOne of SNIB\u2019s largest investments to date is a co-investment with the UK into US-owned Ardersier port on the Moray Firth, an inlet of the North Sea.\n\nScotland has a pipeline of 40 gigawatts of offshore wind projects, all of which will require subsea cables to transfer the power ashore.\n\n\u201cProjects are getting delayed, prices are very high,\u201d said Ian Douglas, XLCC\u2019s chief executive. \u201cCompanies are fighting very hard to secure supply \u2014 you are typically seeing seven-year waits for HVDC cable.\u201d\n\nEuropean cable manufacturers, such as Milan-listed Prysmian, Paris-listed Nexans and Copenhagen-listed NKT, already had full order books, he added.\n\nPrysmian said: \u201cWhilst we have large backlog visibility, to suggest that our order book is full is incorrect.\u201d The company added that it was \u201cworking closely with its customers to deliver on time current, and future projects, and is receiving, and bidding for future orders\u201d.\n\nThe first phase of the XLCC facility\u2019s construction envisions 1,300km a year capacity with the potential to rise to 2,600km a year. Global demand in 2030 was forecast at 10,000km a year, XLCC said.\n\nThe Scottish National party government also hopes to incentivise uptake for supply chain companies, such as XLCC, by encouraging renewables developers that source equipment from domestic sources.\n\nSeabed lease agreements for projects from the late 2020s include requirements for local supply chain involvement.\n\n\u201cThat will propel manufacturing \u2014 it is going to be extremely important to demonstrate local supply chain,\u201d said Gillian Martin, acting secretary for net zero and energy. \u201cCompanies will even now be looking at this place for their cables.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8ce06f13-c09c-42b4-ba65-d29d4983d60d"}}, {"id": "bb1f25cd-9110-4d2a-8ec5-6a4a77b3aae4", "event_name": "Car production at UK plants falls below 1mn vehicles ", "blurb": "European exports slide as carmakers wrestle with slowing sales of EVs in Germany and France", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "Falling exports and the winding down of production of older car models saw UK vehicle manufacturing fall by almost 12 per cent last year, in the worst annual drop since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nCar and van production at British plants fell back below 1mn vehicles, to 905,233 models, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders released on Thursday showed.\n\nThe decline came on the back of weaker exports to Europe as carmakers wrestled with slowing sales of electric vehicles in key markets such as Germany and France.\n\nNissan and Jaguar Land Rover \u2014 the UK\u2019s two largest carmakers \u2014 also halted production of several models such as the Leaf EV and the Jaguar XE as they prepared to launch a new range of EVs.\n\n\u201cAmid significant geopolitical and trade tensions, UK manufacturers are set on turning billions of pounds of investment into production reality,\u201d Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT said. \u201cGrowing pains are inevitable.\u201d\n\nThe production of EVs and plug-in hybrids last year fell by 20.4 per cent, but still accounted for just over a third of all vehicles produced.

Thames Water, the largest and most financially troubled company, has handed its customers a 31 per cent increase that will see bills rise on average by \u00a3151 to \u00a3639 this year.\n\nWater UK said the extra cash was needed to deliver an annual record of \u00a320bn of investment by utilities by March next year, the first wave in a \u00a3104bn programme up to 2030. This would include the upgrading of 1,700 wastewater treatment works as well as supporting the building of nine new reservoirs.\n\nThe reservoirs, some of which will require additional surcharges to bills, were endorsed on Wednesday by chancellor Rachel Reeves as part of her economic growth agenda.\n\nThe sector regulator, Ofwat, said in December that water companies could increase bills by an average of 36 per cent by 2030. It said at the time that it would allow the utilities to apply the majority of these increases in the first year of the five-year period.\n\nThursday\u2019s average bill figures are different to those announced in December as they include CPHI inflation and are adjusted for population forecasts.\n\nDavid Henderson, chief executive of Water UK, acknowledged the pressure on households, pledging to double the amount of support for cash-strapped customers.\n\n\u201cWe understand increasing bills is never welcome and, while we urgently need investment in our water and sewage infrastructure, we know that for many this increase will be difficult,\u201d he said.\n\nSupport varies between companies as social tariff schemes, which are designed to lower bills for struggling households, involve companies surveying wealthier customers to ask whether they agree to subsidise bills for the less well-off.\n\nOfwat said last week that almost half of households in England and Wales had struggled to pay for their water over the past 12 months.

We\u2019ve seen this movie before. The combination in 2016 of Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s first victory saw the American populist right sensing fertile territory in the UK. It petered out. Association with Trump was not electorally helpful. Now the film has a sequel in which Britain is viewed less as a potential soulmate than a weakened enemy to be attacked by the newly buoyant international right.\n\nThere is nothing new in political internationals. From the formal Comintern to the more sinuous networks for globalisation and neoliberalism, there have always been groupings seeking to export their world view. Trump\u2019s first-term strategist Steve Bannon dreamt of a global movement. National Conservatism, an evangelical ethno-nationalist faction with strong ties to Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has worked to extend its influence in the UK.\n\nNor is Britain unused to external attacks \u2014 although in recent years it was Brexit which provoked the incoming ordnance from both Europe and the White House.\n\nWeakened EU nations, notably Germany are also facing fire from the US populist right \u2014 Elon Musk especially. But the UK always saw itself in a separate category: in the Anglosphere, economically liberal and enjoying a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with America.\n\nYet the new attacks focus on Britain\u2019s culture and institutions. The US vice-president JD Vance quips that Labour has turned the UK into an \u201cIslamist country\u201d. Javier Milei, Argentina\u2019s president, parroted the falsehoods that lionise the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, telling Davos delegates that \u201cas we speak, in the UK, citizens are being imprisoned for exposing horrifying crimes committed by Muslim migrants\u201d. Musk\u2019s onslaughts are well-documented and his hostility widely shared on parts of the American right. Ministers soothe themselves with the fact that Trump himself has (so far) refrained from joining the uncoordinated assaults. But even so there are reasons to take it seriously.\n\nThe first is that the UK is floundering. Sir Keir Starmer is unpopular. His new government is facing both ways, increasing taxes and regulation while declaring growth its primary mission. Britain appears up for grabs (as is much of the Anglosphere, with Canada and Australia likely to turn right this year).\n\nSecond, and perhaps most important, this new conservative international is not primarily an economic movement. For sure, the tech billionaires want to undermine a regulatory opponent in Brussels, but Maga\u2019s economics are populist. Its leaders are not troubled if that leads to incoherent policies tailored nationally.\n\nThe movement\u2019s defining feature \u2014 as evidenced by the focus on Islam \u2014 is cultural nationalism. Immigration is the tip of this spear. What unifies the diverse groups on the right is a central argument that the canon of \u201cJudeo-Christian\u201d western values is threatened from within by multiculturalism and progressivism. From the fear of immigrants to the promotion of policies to boost birth rates, the core premise is that the west must act to save its culture.\n\nAllied to this is the argument that the same guilty liberals have also tilted economic policy against ordinary people, via a deep state that does not even work very well. As European economies stutter, these cultural grievances are accelerated by podcasts and social media.\n\nThere is one other key difference: the decontamination of Trump. This time the new conservative international has major bridgeheads in the UK both in Farage\u2019s Reform UK and much of the Conservative party. Tories who kept their distance in 2016 are now openly supportive. Boris Johnson, shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, Nigel Farage and Liz Truss made pilgrimages to Washington for the inauguration.\n\nPolitical attacks have been encouraged and copied by the British right. Suella Braverman, former home secretary, echoed Vance. Little distinguishes the rhetoric of Robert Jenrick, Tory justice spokesman, from Musk.\n\nBritish radical right voices discern a winning Maga agenda for the UK, based around immigration crackdowns, deporting foreign criminals, scrapping net zero initiatives, pushback on trans rights and cuts to Whitehall bureaucracy. Only in their small-state hostility to the NHS do Britain\u2019s populists offer an exploitable vulnerability.\n\nFurthermore, the electoral system, for so long a bulwark against new and hardline parties, might now actually work to their advantage. Talk of a Reform government is overdone, but the party\u2019s current standing could give it a decisive voice in the next parliament. Fear of Reform is pulling Conservatives on to the same territory. One senior Tory laments \u201cLabour has become too unpopular too quickly. We haven\u2019t had time to rebuild our brand.\u201d Meanwhile, Starmer lacks the communication skills to respond to an assertive right.\n\nAnd victory does not have to be absolute. The movement has already shifted the boundaries. Farage\u2019s surging party is now mainstream and the Conservatives have moved to the right. Progressives within the government find themselves in retreat as ministers fret about the threat of Reform.\n\nIt is early days. Labour may recover. Trump\u2019s lustre may fade. But the conservative international has a new sense of momentum. This movie might yet have a different ending.\n\nrobert.shrimsley@ft.com", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e58d02fe-31ed-4a82-b9e3-d2c631d6074f"}}, {"id": "037d744a-ee22-44fb-8838-8393dba96a50", "event_name": "Bank of England warns of risks in relaxing mortgage limits", "blurb": "Andrew Bailey welcomes \u2018open public debate\u2019, but cautions that easing rules could lead to more repossessions", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "The Bank of England governor has warned that government-backed proposals to water down limits on riskier mortgage lending could trigger more home repossessions and fail to help first-time buyers, even as he announced plans to review the policy.\n\nAndrew Bailey told MPs on Wednesday he was \u201cvery happy to have a very open public debate\u201d about the restrictions on UK mortgage lending, but said this should take account of the \u201cbetter outcomes\u201d the rules had provided in avoiding a surge in home loan defaults during recent shocks.\n\n\u201cThey have helped to avoid the creation of a large tail of mortgages, which, when we have the inevitable cyclical downturn or shocks that hit the economy, turn out to be a real problem of the sort we have seen in the past,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cSo I think that has been beneficial.\u201d\n\nHis comments indicate the BoE is reluctant to further relax restrictions on British banks\u2019 mortgage lending after having done so as recently as November.

It changed the lending threshold of this limit in November so it applied to fewer banks.\n\nThe FCA requires banks to carry out affordability tests on applicants for mortgages to ensure they could still afford the monthly repayments if interest rates rose in future. The BoE ditched a similar affordability test in 2022 because it overlapped with the FCA\u2019s rules.\n\nThe FCA said a letter to Starmer this month \u2014 in response to a call from the government asking regulators for pro-growth ideas \u2014 that it would \u201cbegin simplifying responsible lending and advice rules for mortgages, supporting home ownership and opening a discussion on the balance between access to lending and levels of defaults\u201d.\n\nBailey said the potential benefits of easing these limits further would have to be balanced against the gains from keeping them. He also warned it may do little to help first-time buyers whose main obstacle to buying a home is frequently the difficulty in affording the necessary deposit.\n\n\u201cIn all the surveys that are done, when you ask what is the major impediment to getting into the mortgage market, it is affording the deposit,\u201d said Bailey.\n\nNathana\u00ebl Benjamin, the BoE\u2019s executive director for financial stability strategy and risk, told MPs there was still \u201cplenty of headroom\u201d before banks hit the limit on mortgage lending \u201cso that isn\u2019t a barrier\u201d, adding that the proportion of first-time buyers in new mortgage lending was at its highest level for 20 years.\n\nHe also warned that easing limits without increasing the supply of new homes was likely to push up house prices, which would \u201cmake things even more difficult for households to get on the housing ladder\u201d.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/25e466a2-3316-4724-9220-c3311ec015ed"}}, {"id": "bb3eacb9-7f95-461f-acd8-07d01fb4a8c6", "event_name": "Harland & Wolff\u2019s new owner pledges \u00a3100mn to revive UK shipbuilder", "blurb": "Spain\u2019s Navantia says it will push for new orders, including from Royal Navy, to secure future of group", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Harland & Wolff\u2019s new Spanish owner, Navantia, will invest \u00a3100mn to reactivate the UK shipbuilder and deliver a key Royal Navy contract while pushing for new orders that will \u201cdetermine the future of the company\u201d.\n\nDonato Mart\u00ednez, Navantia\u2019s director of strategy, said on Wednesday the state-owned group aimed to triple H&W\u2019s workforce and invest a further \u00a3100mn-\u00a3200mn in the coming years, a measure of its long-term commitment to the bankrupt company best known for building the Titanic.\n\nNavantia this week took over H&W\u2019s four shipyards \u2014 in Belfast, Appledore in England and two in Scotland \u2014 after pushing the UK government to improve the terms of its \u00a31.6bn contract to build three Fleet Solid Support vessels for the Royal Navy.\n\nNeither Navantia nor the UK government said how big the increase was, with Jonathan Reynolds, the UK\u2019s business secretary, insisting only the \u201cabsolute minimum of changes to the contract to ensure its continued delivery\u201d were agreed.\n\n\u201cWe have not finalised the amendment to the FSS contract [with the UK Ministry of Defence], which is required because obviously the original plan cannot be met with the situation [at H&W],\u201d Mart\u00ednez told the Financial Times after a ceremony in Belfast to mark the new ownership.

Construction had been due to begin in 2025; Mart\u00ednez said Appledore would begin cutting steel for the project this year.\n\nThe UK government has hailed Navantia\u2019s rescue of H&W as a boost for the UK shipbuilding industry but some suppliers fear they will be squeezed out and that some work will move to Spain, where Navantia has spare capacity.\n\nMart\u00ednez confirmed Navantia, which has spent more than \u00a320mn since October paying salaries and keeping the yards open, would not pay debts outstanding to contractors for past work but hoped for good relations, noting \u201cwe need them as much as they need us\u201d.\n\nHe said Navantia aimed to seek a partner to \u201cco-invest\u2019 in Methil, one of the Scottish yards, which will focus on offshore wind projects.\n\nDespite H&W\u2019s choppy history, Mart\u00ednez was undaunted by the challenge ahead given Spain\u2019s centuries-old maritime tradition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this business for only 400 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason not to keep doing [it] for another 400\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009We are very stubborn.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6116548a-4fba-44b1-b5b3-8f751293ceaa"}}, {"id": "d1267e12-1942-4f21-a526-e28899ddc6b3", "event_name": "\u2018The only winners are lawyers\u2019: Heathrow braces for long journey to third runway ", "blurb": "Totemic infrastructure project set for significant hurdles even after political green light ", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves set out a vision to \u201cmake Britain the world\u2019s best connected place to do business\u201d on Wednesday, as she signalled support for massive airport expansion across London.\n\nReeves said the government wanted a third runway at Heathrow \u2014 even though it will take more than a decade to deliver \u2014 and signalled support for more immediate expansions at Gatwick and Luton airports. Projects at Stansted and City have already been approved.\n\nIf delivered, the expanded airports could handle 309mn passengers annually \u2014 an 85 per cent increase on the 167mn travellers who used the airports in 2023, the last year for which there is complete data \u2014 according to a Financial Times analysis.\n\nThe scale of the plans shows how airports, and their group of largely international investor owners, are betting that air travel will continue to grow in the coming decades, unencumbered by concerns over carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cThe chancellor is right to get behind airports,\u201d said Karen Dee, chief executive of trade association AirportsUK. \u201cExpanding capacity will support growth\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and will not come at the expense of our sustainability goals.\u201d\n\nBut industry experts said growth of this scale would throw up serious challenges, including the need to redraw the flight paths in the skies over London and the south east of England to accommodate all the extra aircraft, likely impacting new communities with noise pollution.\n\nEnthusiasm from the chancellor also belied barely-concealed tensions within the cabinet that have emerged over the UK\u2019s most contentious infrastructure project in decades.\n\nIf successful, it would also likely make flying more expensive, particularly from Heathrow, as the airport raises the landing fees charged to airlines to recoup the cost of building the runway.\n\nStill, Becrom Basu, a partner at LEK Consulting who has advised Heathrow, said the new capacity would be used.\n\n\u201cThe London market has been struggling to meet demand for a while\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I think investors can be comfortable there will be a business case for that level of demand,\u201d he said.\n\nBy far the most serious challenge is likely to be the impact of airport expansion on the UK\u2019s carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cI find it a bit difficult to see how you could have a third runway at Heathrow and a significant expansion of flight numbers at Gatwick within the government\u2019s carbon budget,\u201d said one person closely involved with the 2015 Conservative government decision to back a third runway at Heathrow. The airport never put forward a planning application because of the pandemic, however.\n\nCasting herself as a chancellor willing to make \u201cbold decisions in the national interest\u201d, Reeves called on Heathrow\u2019s management to put forward plans to build a third runway as soon as this summer.\n\nWhile previous governments had offered lukewarm support to the politically controversial project, Heathrow\u2019s chief executive Thomas Woldbye said he believed the airport would now \u201csit round the table together\u201d with the government to deliver the third runway.\n\n\u201cWe can trust the government, they can be with us for many years,\u201d he said.\n\nWoldbye said the airport will now dust off its 2019 blueprint for expansion, which was shelved when the pandemic struck in 2020. Costed at \u00a314bn in 2014, it involves diverting the nearby M25 motorway into a tunnel, demolishing 750 homes, a primary school and an energy plant.\n\nBut few doubt the scale of the political challenges still facing the project.\n\nEarlier this month energy secretary Ed Miliband said he would not resign if the third runway went ahead, in what appeared to be a capitulation by the project\u2019s biggest cabinet opponent.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, Miliband was said to be \u201clivid\u201d, according to one government figure familiar with the situation. He was not among the cabinet ministers at the speech.\n\nOther cabinet ministers were also taken aback by what appeared to be a sudden decision by Reeves several weeks ago. \u201cThere really has been a huge row about it, between the Treasury and just about everybody,\u201d said one person close to the discussions.\n\nSome Whitehall officials even suggested Reeves had tried to bounce Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer \u2014 who previously voted against the measure \u2014 into publicly endorsing the project. He so far avoided doing so, ducking a question on it at last week\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Questions session.\n\nDespite Reeves\u2019 warm words, one sceptic inside the government said that Heathrow\u2019s development consent order would still have to pass stringent criteria on climate, air pollution and noise.\n\n\u201cThey will still have to reach the same standards that they did 24 hours before this announcement,\u201d they said. \u201cThere is a lot of road to run on this.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile long-standing opponent London mayor Sadiq Khan said he remained \u201csimply not convinced that you can have hundreds of thousands of additional flights at Heathrow every year without a hugely damaging impact on our environment\u201d.\n\nRuth Cadbury, Labour MP for Brentford & Isleworth \u2014 and chair of the transport select committee \u2014 said the committee would now examine \u201chow clear the links between airport expansion and growth\u201d are.\n\nCadbury said she was sceptical that the project could ever meet the four tests set by the government on climate change, regional economic benefits, noise and air pollution.\n\n\u201cThe test is whether the project provides growth for UK [businesses] as a whole, for the nations and regions, and does it? Not really,\u201d she said.\n\nReeves, by contrast, insisted the third runway would benefit the entire country.\n\nReeves insisted the expansion was compatible with the government\u2019s \u201clegal, environmental and climate obligations\u201d, as she pointed to technological advances that could pave the way to \u201ccleaner and greener aviation\u201d.\n\nThe aviation industry agrees it can grow while decarbonising. Its road map to net zero 2050, published in 2022, assumes that passenger numbers can still grow while emissions fall.\n\nTo do this it is largely relying on \u201csustainable aviation fuels\u201d or SAFs, which are made up of a diverse range of sources from crops and used cooking oil to household waste. The industry estimates they can emit about 70 per cent less carbon dioxide over its life cycle than traditional aviation fuel.\n\nBut it is far more expensive than jet fuel and currently only available in tiny quantities. Airline bosses have said the industry will need considerably more government support to scale up the production of SAFs to reach net zero.\n\nColin Walker, head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit research group, said the government\u2019s hopes that sustainable aviation fuel will offset the extra emissions from Heathrow\u2019s expansion \u201care unrealistic\u201d.\n\n\u201cA third runway will increase emissions way beyond the capacity of these fuels to offset them,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile planning experts said Heathrow has spent decades unsuccessfully pushing for growth.\n\n\u201cHeathrow would have to run really hard and the government\u2019s decisions would be challenged along the way,\u201d said Alistair Watson, partner and head of planning at Taylor Wessing.\n\n\u201cThe only ones who will win from this are lawyers.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a16706ea-9d64-4840-a0fc-4a7c922d3840"}}, {"id": "dd19671e-aed6-4997-98ad-2c03c3239319", "event_name": "Labour is facing two ways on growth", "blurb": "The UK government is starting to change the narrative but needs a joined-up approach", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 change of tone on growth has been long in coming. The Labour government\u2019s repeated emphasis since coming to power on its lousy inheritance from 14 years of Conservative rule \u2014 though correct \u2014 has damaged business and consumer confidence, and made its own task even harder. The UK chancellor has at last begun to construct a more positive and forward-looking narrative. Yet this is a government that still faces two ways on growth. It vaunts its commitment to rekindling the animal spirits of enterprise even as the taxes and regulation it has heaped on to business are impeding the expansion it claims to want.\n\nIf the growth quest is to succeed, one priority must be to demonstrate a joined-up approach across government. Reeves\u2019 statements that economic expansion is the sine qua non of Labour\u2019s entire agenda often seem aimed at convincing fellow ministers as much as the country at large. Prime minister Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s pledge to \u201chard wire\u201d growth into cabinet decisions, by requiring \u201cgrowth credentials\u201d to be set out in policy consultations, is positive. But parts of the cabinet\u2019s programme \u2014 notably its overcooked employment rights bill \u2014 still work against its supposedly overriding priority.\n\nThe government needs to ensure, too, that its enthusiasm for grand projects that may take decades to bear fruit is matched by a zeal to sweep away the constraints on more immediate investment across the economy. Committing to major developments such as the Oxford-Cambridge \u201cgrowth corridor\u201d and a third runway at Heathrow \u2014 provided they are delivered \u2014 is important as a way of driving long-term GDP growth. It sends a useful message to overseas investors that Britain remains ambitious and open to business. Business groups are clear that well-planned infrastructure developments create jobs and lasting economic gains.\n\nYet what many companies, especially small and mid-sized businesses that account for half of all private-sector turnover, are interested in above all is faster progress on deregulation, such as easing planning controls on everything from housing to wind farms.\n\nAfter the government ousted the chair of its competition watchdog last week, they want to hear quickly how it plans to strike the elusive balance between a lighter-touch regulatory approach and opening up the risks of abusive corporate behaviour or financial failures. A truly smart approach here could create a competitive advantage over the sclerotic EU, which on Wednesday launched its own effort to slash red tape in the face of Donald Trump\u2019s deregulation drive in the US.\n\nAbove all, however, Labour needs to correct its own mistakes \u2014 and lighten the new burdens it heaped on to business by placing the brunt of the \u00a340bn tax increase in its October Budget on to employers and imposing onerous worker rights rules. The government is unlikely to row back on its headline increase in payroll taxes, though it should look again at how inheritance tax changes will hit family businesses. That leaves the employment rights bill as the area most ripe for concessions. Labour must address business concerns over the way it plans to grant day-one protections against unfair dismissal, broaden the rights of those on zero-hour contracts and hand more powers to unions in the workplace.\n\nThere are other areas where more boldness is needed. Labour should rethink the red lines that are hemming in its ability to conclude the ambitious new deal it says it wants with the EU. But if its commitment to its overriding priority is genuine, Labour\u2019s biggest task is to heed what the enterprises that can deliver growth say they need.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/70bb9d44-49f0-4ec6-9e6a-ecca8397e770"}}, {"id": "b9cc3d27-4fc0-4353-ae47-5df2d1644471", "event_name": "UK-based spy ring had links to top Bulgarian politicians, court told ", "blurb": "Three defendants accused of carrying out Russian-backed espionage ", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "A UK-based spy ring gathering intelligence for Russia had links to the \u201chighest echelons\u201d of the Bulgarian government, prosecutors said on Wednesday.\n\nBiser Dzhambazov, 43, told Orlin Roussev, 46, that his relationship with several Bulgarian politicians \u2014 such as President Rumen Radev, former deputy prime minister Korneliya Ninova and National Assembly member Boyko Rashkov \u2014 was \u201ciron clad\u201d, prosecutors said.\n\nThe pair have both pleaded guilty to conspiring to spy on behalf of Russia.\n\nThe allegations come from the trial of three Bulgarians \u2014 Katrin Ivanova, 33, Vanya Gaberova, 30, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39 \u2014 who have been charged with conspiracy to spy in a ring that prosecutors say was overseen by former Wirecard chief operating officer Jan Marsalek.\n\nProsecutor Alison Morgan KC told the jury at the Old Bailey court in London that the pair were \u201cgleeful\u201d about the outcome of Bulgaria\u2019s November 2021 general election, which the incumbent Radev won, and \u201ccould not wait to get started on exploiting those connections\u201d.\n\nIn December 2021, Dzhambazov told Roussev that they had to \u201cwork out\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009what we want and what we offer\u201d to the Bulgarian government, adding \u201cI\u2019m sure they won\u2019t let us down\u201d.

This was necessary. The negative background mood, after hopes rose ahead of the election and immediately after, relapsed following the October Budget to one of recurrent disappointment, low expectation and dismay at the apparent lack of a narrative.\n\nThe UK has re-entered a period of close to zero economic growth. The hit to business confidence, induced by the Budget, has been compounded by concerns about rising global bond yields and the constraints this places on the government\u2019s ability to spend, and with it, to borrow.\n\nIn her speech, Reeves acknowledged the cost to business from the national insurance increase \u2014 and again attempted to explain that she felt it necessary to get the finances under control. But as she pivoted to talk about the supply side, the picture became much more hopeful.\n\nRather than becoming overly stressed about demand management, I believe this supply-side focus is right. First, because much of the demand will be determined by the Bank of England: if interest rates are reduced in the way many forecast, this should be an important driver. So Reeves would not want to take steps to offset this possibility too much \u2014 not least because it would probably help bring UK bond yields down.\n\nSecond, as ministers have been eager to tell anyone who will listen, the government is constrained by its own fiscal rules, the first of which limits current spending. If it wants to avoid further tax rises, it will have to stick to them \u2014 or something close to them.\n\nThird \u2014 and this is especially important \u2014 the UK\u2019s problem going right back to the 2008 financial crisis, and before, has always been the supply side. Namely, our woeful productivity and our weak private and public investment. Since the crisis, feeble average growth of 1.5 per cent has been almost completely driven by very strong labour force growth. Productivity growth has remained extremely weak. If we are to have stronger growth while being less inflation-prone, we need more investment and more productivity \u2014 it really is that simple.\n\nSo Reeves needs to ensure that the government\u2019s 10-year infrastructure strategy is centre stage from now on.\n\nThe chancellor correctly talked about excessive regulation, planning approval blocks and a lack of commitment to growth-enhancing investment projects. She promised support for a large scattering of projects to address the persistent delays and barriers to infrastructure, including the Ox-Cam project, support for a third runway at Heathrow as well as a number of schemes in the north of England.\n\nWhat was missing was the framework. There was no place in her narrative for the institutions that will be crucial to delivering transparent, high-multiplier investments \u2014 and they are not actually yet up and running. But this emphasis will be necessary if the government is to instil confidence in investors.\n\nChancellors always like to announce big attention-catching investments even if, like the Heathrow expansion, they are controversial. Very often, though, these are not accompanied by fresh government capital and are announced on a \u201ctrust us\u201d basis in terms of real, lasting benefits.\n\nIn this, Reeves is no exception. She cited Frontier Economics research suggesting that a third runway would have positive multipliers outside the London area \u2014 this should become part of the framework for every major initiative. But it must be done systematically, especially as the government will need to observe its second fiscal rule, and borrow to invest. Without such a framework, \u201ctrust us\u201d might not get such a positive response from the gilt or equity market.\n\nThe new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority will not be established until April. But this entity, along with the National Audit Office and others, will be absolutely fundamental to encouraging business, inside and outside of the UK, to boost the economy\u2019s growth potential with investments. I am surprised that the chancellor chose not to talk about it: in effect, this will add and support the growth-focused division of the Treasury that both Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer have promised to establish.\n\nIn this spirit, I hope that Reeves will empower Nista to be completely transparent about the investment projects that will have positive multipliers. Because this is also the pathway for indirectly boosting the demand side of the economy, unleashing longer-lasting animal spirits in business and consumers alike.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/26f8a8c1-aabc-4513-8137-ff1144db0f74"}}, {"id": "9b9c20ab-24e8-41ac-9893-cda9eb68f6a9", "event_name": "Reform UK\u2019s Mayfair fundraiser attracts \u2018disgruntled\u2019 ex-Tory donors", "blurb": "Attendees paid five-figure sums to attend dinner hosted by Nigel Farage on Tuesday ", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "More than half a dozen major former Conservative donors paid five-figure sums to attend a lavish fundraiser for Reform UK that raised more than \u00a31mn on Tuesday evening.\n\nPast Tory supporters Bassim Haidar and Mohamed Amersi confirmed their presence, and that they had each paid \u00a325,000 for a VIP ticket to the event in order to sit at the top table with party leader Nigel Farage.\n\nHaidar said there were at least eight significant former Conservative donors including himself at the event, while Amersi estimated there were many more \u201cdisgruntled Tory donors\u201d at the gathering of about 100 people.\n\nHaidar, a Nigerian-born Lebanese entrepreneur who has given \u00a3675,000 to the Conservatives in the past two years, told the FT the event was \u201ca valuable opportunity to learn more about the party\u2019s mission, and I believe they have a good one to \u2018make the UK great again\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe said it was \u201cworth considering them as a strong alternative\u201d to the Tories, whose crackdown on non-doms prompted vocal criticism from Haidar last year.\n\nFellow tycoon Amersi, a UK citizen born in Kenya, said the party \u201ccertainly appeared far more electable than I would ever have imagined, and Farage was inspirational.\u201d He added: \u201cThe energy was electric.\u201d\n\nHe said Nigel Farage\u2019s links to Donald Trump were an \u201cadded bonus\u201d and praised property magnate Nick Candy, the former Tory donor who became Reform\u2019s treasurer last month.\n\nAmersi, who has given more than \u00a3500,000 to the Tories since 2018, said he remained a Conservative member and would be attending a cocktail party it was hosting on Wednesday night in London, as he wished to keep abreast of developments.\n\nBut he said the Tories were \u201closing momentum\u201d and accused party leader Kemi Badenoch of having \u201cno policies, no outreach, no connectivity\u201d, adding that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what ground she is occupying\u201d.\n\nAsked about past Tory donors attending the Reform dinner this week, Badenoch\u2019s spokesperson said on Wednesday: \u201cThere are lots of donors out there and we\u2019re looking for new donors all the time, bringing donors back to the party, so we are very confident about our fundraising.\u201d\n\nThey added that the Tory leader is getting the party back on a sure financial footing ready to fight the local elections in May.\n\nMyles Barclay, a young member of the Barclay banking family, and Andrew Reid, the British horse race trainer and former treasurer of the UK Independence party, also attended the dinner, according to two people who attended the event.

The decision is meant to simplify the business further, said the company, which has more than 330,000 employees, in a statement.\n\nBaiti\u00e9h\u2019s comments came as Reeves, in a speech on Wednesday, defended her decision to increase employers\u2019 NICs but acknowledged there were \u201cconsequences on business and beyond\u201d.\n\nSeparately, Morrisons boasted about recording the strongest quarterly sales improvement in almost four years, thanks to better product availability and competitive prices that attracted shoppers to its stores.\n\nBut since its financial year ended, growth slowed quarter on quarter after a cyber attack at a technology provider affected availability and subsequently dented Christmas sales.\n\nBaiti\u00e9h said: \u201cNothing in retail is a straight line and that was certainly the case in the first quarter. Our availability is improving, and although it remains above last year, it is not yet back to pre-incident level.\u201d\n\nMorrisons is the UK\u2019s fifth-biggest supermarket by market share. According to industry data this month from Kantar, Morrisons\u2019 sales growth lagged behind Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2014 the UK\u2019s two largest supermarket chains \u2014 as well as discounters Aldi and Lidl during the festive period.\n\nMorrisons\u2019 like-for-like sales rose 4.9 per cent in its fourth quarter to October 27, the strongest quarter since the start of 2021, compared with a 3.3 per cent increase during the same quarter the previous year.\n\nGroup full-year like-for-like sales were up 4.1 per cent, while total revenue increased 3.8 per cent to \u00a315.3bn. Underlying profits, its preferred metric, rose 11.2 per cent to \u00a3835mn, the company said.\n\nAnnual pre-tax loss broadly halved to about \u00a3500mn, according to finance chief Jo Goff, and net debt has fallen to about \u00a33bn, from \u00a35.5bn \u201cat peak\u201d. Its annual interest payments are about \u00a3250mn a year, she added.\n\nLast year Morrisons agreed a deal to sell its petrol forecourt business to Motor Fuel Group, also owned by CD&R, with the majority of the \u00a32.5bn proceeds used to pay down its debt.\n\nEleanor Simpson-Gould, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cMorrisons has begun to emerge from a bleak period of meagre sales and mounting debt with a strengthened balance sheet.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b841f643-4462-4524-96d0-3a376eaa3c55"}}, {"id": "9ad290e2-208e-4433-8fb2-d0e994c5b37e", "event_name": "American and European populism don\u2019t mix", "blurb": "Elon Musk will find the European right more statist than some progressives at home", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Two conflicting thoughts about DeepSeek seem plausible right now. Forced to be resourceful, China is starting to expose the artificial intelligence sector of the US as flabby and coddled. Alternatively, don\u2019t panic, America: the brute scale of US capital will tell in the end, as will the nation\u2019s openness to foreign talent.\n\nEither way, notice the absence of a third horse from all the discussion this week. You wouldn\u2019t know that Europe accounts for a comparable share of world economic output to China and the US. Whatever the feats of such companies as Mistral, the continent\u2019s role in AI \u2014 in fact, its place in the world \u2014 is increasingly that of an infant watching both parents squabbling overhead.\n\nHow has it come to this? Over-regulation of business, say some. Or a far from complete single market, which means that close to half a billion people (who are well-off by world standards) count for less than they should. Yet a third speculation is that Europe lacks an entrepreneurial culture. Whatever relative weight you accord these factors, notice that each one is to some extent a choice. It is hard to escape the conclusion that Europe\u2019s \u201crevealed preference\u201d is to forfeit some economic dynamism for other things.\n\nThis is why, despite their best efforts, Elon Musk and other Silicon Valley moguls around Donald Trump will struggle to shape Europe. Their techno-libertarianism has much less purchase on the other side of the Atlantic, even \u2014 or especially \u2014 among the hard right. Who can imagine Marine Le Pen, supporter of free public transport for young workers, freezing government grants and loans as Trump tried to do this week? Even Giorgia Meloni, a pro-market reformer of sorts, has spent much of the time since the pandemic disbursing EU funds.\n\nIn Europe, nationalism is bound up with paternalism to a degree that is alien to the US experience. (Imperial Germany under Bismarck pioneered the welfare state.) The UK isn\u2019t an exception. Brexit was, in part, a bet that British people are essentially Americans in their relish for capitalism, if only the dead hand of Brussels would let them go. Well, the fifth anniversary of the formal exit is this Friday. Still no UK government has felt politically safe to cut much regulation. Even the flintiest Tory must know that, if a single day were shaved off the statutory paid leave allowance, say, there would be pandemonium, much of it among Brexit voters. To be \u201crightwing\u201d in Europe and America just means different things.\n\nEven within the Trump government, the tech bros are at philosophical odds with the pro-worker Maga base. But at least the two camps can come together over American jingoism. What is going to glue Musk to Europe\u2019s hard right? A shared position on certain cultural issues? It doesn\u2019t seem enough to paper over such wildly different visions of the proper relationship between the individual and the state. Granted, both sides have an interest in the paralysis or destruction of the EU: it would spare Silicon Valley a lot of regulation. But the idea that tech would get an easier ride from a fragmented, populist-led Europe could only be entertained by someone with no knowledge of, say, Le Pen\u2019s economic platform over the years.\n\nThe attempt to build a transatlantic club of populists isn\u2019t new. Another Trump associate, Steve Bannon, tried it in the past decade. These projects tend to fall short for a reason that shouldn\u2019t need spelling out. If a movement\u2019s core idea is national assertiveness, the various branches of it around the world will almost by definition come into conflict. One nation\u2019s expansionist territorial claims affect another\u2019s. The desire of Strongman X to push his tech companies into foreign markets rubs against Strongman Y\u2019s security paranoia and amour propre. The Russo-Japanese war, Operation Barbarossa, the Sino-Soviet split: liberalism owes its survival in large part to the innate fissiparousness of those who hate it. Trump, Le Pen and the like aren\u2019t monsters on anything approaching that scale. But the principle that jingoists tend to fall out, must fall out, holds. There won\u2019t be a Nationalist International.\n\nNot long ago, self-respecting European reactionaries almost defined themselves against the US, which they saw as both culturally imperial and culturally empty. Even in the cold war, when the alternative was communism, parts of the continental right stood aloof. At least US Republicans used to notice the snub, and mind. Now? No head of government in the EU is closer to China than Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary. Yet no head of government in the EU is more beloved of America\u2019s anti-China hard right. Whether this double game says more about his wiliness or the attention span of today\u2019s Republicans, it is a lesson in how differently a European populist can see geopolitics from an American.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a call for liberals to relax. The US right has the resources to put more than a thumb on the scales of European politics. With a federal election close, the Alternative for Germany is being magnified through the personal attention of Musk. But these are tactics. A more lasting alliance, an American-exported revolution, assumes a harmony of worldview that isn\u2019t there. If the European hard right succeeds, it won\u2019t be on account of outsiders whose very foreignness might incur a backlash. Liberalism has always been able to count on its enemies turning their belligerence on each other.\n\njanan.ganesh@ft.com", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4c825adc-11ac-4fd7-be9f-37155468e8a3"}}, {"id": "ecb2aac2-3184-4a27-bc32-ddff75284ece", "event_name": "Heathrow expansion can support growth \u2014 with a long runway", "blurb": "A shovel is yet to hit the ground despite efforts to expand the hub dating back decades \u2014 and the barriers remain huge", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Get Britain building again! In any conversation about the UK\u2019s ability to construct large, growth-boosting infrastructure projects \u2014 or not \u2014 a third runway at Heathrow tops the list of missed opportunities. Efforts to expand the west London hub date back decades.\n\nThat makes it an obvious target for UK chancellor Rachel Reeves, who wants to persuade investors and businesses that her government is pro-growth. The difficulty is convincing them that a third runway can actually be delivered.\n\nOn paper, there are some sound economic arguments to support expansion. Heathrow is not only the UK\u2019s busiest airport, catering to an estimated 83.8mn passengers in 2024, it is also the country\u2019s largest port by value.\n\nEven with its current two runways it has kept increasing passenger numbers, breaking a fresh record in November. Yet further growth, through small changes such as persuading airlines to switch to bigger jets, will have limits. Flights are capped at 480,000 annually. Slots to launch new routes are constrained; the airport is running at 99 per cent capacity.\n\nThere are soft benefits, too. Almost any traveller will have a story about delays or flight cancellations at Heathrow \u2014 in part a symptom of its capacity constraints.\n\nTrue, there are five other \u201cLondon\u201d airports that airlines can choose from, if Southend in Essex is included. But Heathrow is a favourite for long-haul carriers as transfer traffic makes certain routes economically viable.\n\nIn reality, though, the barriers remain huge. A previous Labour administration approved a third runway at the airport in 2009. A shovel is yet to hit the ground.\n\nEven if the weighty concerns of environment campaigners and west London residents could be swept aside, the cost and how it can be funded without making passengers and airlines balk are still big unknowns. Even in 2014, when Heathrow forecast the cost at close to \u00a314bn, others reckoned this was an underestimation. Airlines are wary of how much charges \u2014 passed on to passengers \u2014 would have to rise to fund the returns private investors would demand.\n\nOf course impasses over big, tricky projects have been broken before. Nuclear power plants in the UK had a similar stop-start history, which ended in 2016 when Theresa May\u2019s government gave the go-ahead for the Hinkley Point C plant in south-west England. But now over-time and over-budget, it may not be a comparison the government is keen to make.\n\nWhat\u2019s obvious, though, is this isn\u2019t really about near-term growth at all \u2014 rather the perception of growth. With UK businesses deeply gloomy about the consequences of Budget tax changes this year, it is little wonder the chancellor is grasping for any levers she can to get the endorphins going.\n\nnathalie.thomas@ft.com", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a71dc3c4-7139-4843-b0fc-2ff1cbf012f8"}}, {"id": "6eef8f6b-b1cb-42ed-9c97-cbeac0c6692b", "event_name": "Rachel Reeves urges Heathrow airport to fast-track third runway", "blurb": "Boss of hub calls timetable for expansion \u2018ambitious, but not undoable\u2019", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "UK chancellor Rachel Reeves has urged Heathrow airport to fast-track proposals to build a third runway, in a much-trailed speech that sought to reinvigorate the Labour government\u2019s growth agenda.\n\nReeves said the government hoped to grant planning permission to Heathrow\u2019s expansion by the end of the current parliament in 2029, a target the airport\u2019s boss told the Financial Times was \u201cambitious, but not undoable\u201d.\n\nThe chancellor said expanding Heathrow would \u201cunlock further growth, boost investment, increase exports and make Britain more open and more connected\u201d in a speech on her plans to boost the flatlining UK economy.\n\n\u201cI can confirm today that this government supports a third runway at Heathrow and is inviting proposals to be brought forward by the summer,\u201d Reeves said.\n\nThomas Woldbye, chief executive of Heathrow, the UK\u2019s largest airport, told the FT he was confident the hub would put forward detailed proposals on that timeline. He added that the earliest the third runway could be completed would be the mid-2030s if everything went to plan.\n\n\u201cThe target is to have planning permission by the end of this parliament. That is ambitious, but not undoable, seen from our point of view,\u201d he said.\n\nWoldbye added: \u201cWe are standing on, if you like, a huge body of work that has been done in the past 10 years. If we didn\u2019t have that, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do that, because this is a huge and complicated project.\u201d\n\nHeathrow\u2019s pre-pandemic blueprint was for a multibillion-pound megaproject that would include diverting the M25 motorway into a tunnel to make room for the new runway. In the process, 750 homes and a primary school would be demolished.\n\nReeves said airport expansion was compatible with the government\u2019s legally binding net zero 2050 target, pointing to \u201ccleaner and greener flying\u201d through so-called sustainable aviation fuels.\n\nSir Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said he \u201cremained opposed\u201d to a new runway.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m simply not convinced that you can have hundreds of thousands of additional flights at Heathrow every year without a hugely damaging impact on our environment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe government\u2019s push for airport expansion has also alarmed local residents and environmental groups.\n\n\u201cInstead of picking up any old polluting project from the discard pile, the chancellor should focus on industries that can attract investment and bring wider economic and social benefits,\u201d said Greenpeace UK\u2019s policy director Doug Parr.\n\nExpansion plans at London\u2019s Gatwick and Luton airports are further ahead in the planning process than Heathrow. Transport secretary Heidi Alexander is expected to greenlight their proposals by spring.\n\nIn her speech in\u00a0Oxfordshire on Wednesday, Reeves stressed her determination to \u201cgrow the supply side of our economy\u201d, outlining a three-pillar approach built on stability, reform and investment.\n\n\u201cGrowth will not come without a fight, without a government willing to take the right decisions now to change our country\u2019s future for the better,\u201d she said.\n\nReeves also confirmed plans to make Oxford and Cambridge \u201cEurope\u2019s Silicon Valley\u201d, with new transport links between the university towns, as well as support for a proposed regeneration scheme around Manchester United\u2019s stadium at Old Trafford.\n\nBusiness leaders have previously criticised the Labour government for introducing measures that executives say will hit growth, including a\u00a0\u00a325bn national insurance increase on employers and new labour laws.\n\nReeves defended the tax rises as necessary given the government\u2019s fiscal inheritance and declined to answer a question on whether she was ruling out further taxes on businesses.\n\nReacting to the speech, Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturers\u2019 organisation Make UK, warned that the government\u00a0needed to resolve the contradiction\u00a0between\u00a0the Budget tax rises and the ambitions set out by the chancellor.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear contradiction between implementing laudable measures such as planning reform and infrastructure investment whilst, at the same time, applying a handbrake through measures which will inevitably reduce investment and freeze recruitment. This is a clear dichotomy that government needs to resolve internally,\u201d he said.\n\nThe chancellor also stood by Labour\u2019s flagship workers\u2019 rights package.\n\nThe measures could cost businesses up to \u00a35bn a year, according to the government\u2019s own analysis and have been heavily opposed by industry, but Reeves argued they would bolster growth.\n\n\u201cA secure workforce is a more confident, more productive workforce and also more confident to spend in the economy,\u201d she said.\n\nShe insisted that deputy prime minister Angela Rayner and business secretary Jonathan Reynolds have \u201cworked closely with business to understand their concerns\u201d, including on probation periods and the flexibility to take on workers during busy times, such as school holidays.\n\nIn a bid to reassure industry, she said the bill that the government takes through parliament \u201cwill reflect those concerns so that we get the balance right, supporting working people and supporting businesses\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by Peter Foster in London and Jennifer Williams in Manchester", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a48ef610-49e5-44f7-9a68-64f7d3edd920"}}, {"id": "a4cf967c-34d5-41fb-9d00-329b09c3ed50", "event_name": "Changing UK\u2019s counterterror strategy comes with trade-offs and benefits", "blurb": "Separate bodies tasked with tackling specific ideologies can lead to twisted incentives", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning. Rachel Reeves has a big speech today in which she will promise to go \u201cfurther and faster\u201d to increase UK economic growth. (Our story here.) However, I will wait until after the chancellor\u2019s address before giving my thoughts, as I prefer not to analyse speech extracts.\n\nThere is still more to be said about the government\u2019s options for tweaking our counterterrorism response following the Southport murders. One aspect of that was the subject of an urgent question in the House of Commons yesterday. So today, I want to talk about the benefits of keeping those changes within the walls of the UK\u2019s existing counterterrorism capabilities or as an extension to it.\n\nPrevent was established in the wake of the 2005 bombings in London, in which the perpetrators were all British-born. Its brief then was solely to focus on Islamist extremist terror, which makes up roughly 75 per cent of MI5\u2019s counterterrorism caseload in the UK. Since then, Prevent\u2019s remit has been expanded to include other forms of extremism, most importantly from a resource perspective the extreme far-right, which makes up almost all of the remainder of MI5\u2019s caseload.\n\nSome critics of the programme argue that this broadening of scope waters down Prevent\u2019s focus and thus its effectiveness. I think there\u2019s some truth in this, but there\u2019s a trade-off either way. One reason why I favour keeping all the extremist ideologies under one hat is that very few organisations advocate for their own abolition. As I\u2019ve written a lot lately, violent animal rights activists, who in the 2000s represented a serious threat both to the life of scientific researchers and to the ability of the UK to actually deliver scientific advances, have been pretty comprehensively routed by the British security services.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that violent animal rights activists are never going to re-enter the scene, but I am saying that, at present, they aren\u2019t a big threat in the UK. I think the nature of human affairs is that, if a separate part of the UK\u2019s counterterrorism apparatus were dealing with violent animal rights activists, they would be talking up this threat to ensure their continued relevance, engaging in turf wars with other bits of the security services and generally this would drain resources and time to no good end.\n\nSimilarly, a stripped down Prevent is not going to unlock greater time and resources to tackle the problem of people who support or commit acts of terror because they are Islamist extremists. It is going to spend that time having bureaucratic battles with whatever organisation you set up to address the problem of people who support or commit acts of terror because they are on the extreme right, the extreme left, and various other causes that are currently marginal in the UK.\n\nWe may not ever be able to comprehensively defeat either Islamist extremists or the extreme far right, as we currently have done to violent animal rights activists. But it is at least theoretically arguable we shouldn\u2019t create organisations that are incentivised to pretend that we have not prevailed.\n\nViolence for violence\u2019s sake, however, which typifies many spree killers and school shooters, and was the case for Axel Rudakubana, is a perennial policy problem. No state has a clear sense of how to stop that problem entirely and it may well simply be part of the human condition. A separate focus on those committing violent acts for their own sake wouldn\u2019t have the same risks of obsolescence later down the line \u2014 but would, of course, still be competing for resources.\n\nI had a lovely dinner last night courtesy of Martin Sandbu, but I did not, alas, have the presence of mind to ask for his recipe book.

Some groups have gained notoriety for headline-grabbing stunts, from throwing soup at works of art to breaking bank office windows.\n\nThe restrictions on protest and longer jail times across the world have sparked fears among academics and civil rights organisations of far-reaching consequences that could limit not just climate activists but the ability of any citizen to protest against any government, business or policy in the future.\n\nThe UN\u2019s rapporteur for environmental defenders Michel Forst told the Financial Times: \u201cDisproportionate sanctions for protests\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009have a significant adverse impact on the most fundamental freedoms.\n\n\u201cNot only of those who are personally criminalised for protesting, but also on every person concerned who would like to take part in protests but is deterred from doing so, by fear of being fined, tried, arrested or imprisoned for that.\u201d\n\nThe appellants argue that their \u201cconscientious motivation\u201d should have been taken into account during sentencing under both common and European human rights laws, while also questioning whether throwing soup at glass is an act of violence.\n\nThe UK has been at the forefront of attempts to curb protesters, according to academics, activists and non-profits. Until the emergence of activist group XR in 2018 and later JSO and Insulate Britain, which campaigns for greater energy efficiency, the country had little history of jailing non-violent climate protesters.\n\nOscar Berglund, a lecturer at Bristol university and specialist on climate activism, said protesters had been \u201ctargeted because they are effective to some extent\u201d.\n\nThe initial \u201cgreat wave\u201d of climate protests in 2019, with the emergence of XR and Fridays for Future, played a strong role in raising political and public awareness of climate change, said Andrew Firmin of Civicus, a non-profit group focused on strengthening citizen action.\n\nThe UK target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 was at least partially influenced by the climate protest movement, he said.\n\nBut critics say the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act of 2022 and the Public Order Act of 2023 have made it increasingly difficult to hold non-violent but disruptive protests, while also allowing for longer sentences.\n\nA report led by Lord Walney, commissioned by the previous government, called for a ban on extremist protest groups, arguing the \u201cbattle against climate change [has] been hijacked\u201d by those \u201cdetermined to bypass democratic norms and cause maximum disruption to society\u201d.\n\nThe Labour government declined to comment. Before being elected, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he backed stiff sentences for climate protesters who blocked roads.\n\nAmong those appealing against their sentences this week are 78-year-old grandmother and retired teacher Gaie Delap. Last year, she was jailed for 20 months for climbing on to gantries over the M25, but later released early. Before Christmas she was recalled to prison after no electronic tag \u2014 a condition of her early release \u2014 was available to fit her wrist.\n\nPhoebe Plummer, 23, who threw soup at the glass covering Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cSunflowers\u201d, is also appealing against her two-year sentence.\n\nIn other cases, protesters have been jailed without being found guilty of their alleged crimes. This includes 39-year-old Amy Pritchard.\n\nDuring her trial for public nuisance for blocking traffic, the presiding judge banned the defendants from mentioning climate change \u2014 Pritchard defied the order, intending to explain to the jury what had motivated her actions.\n\nWhile jurors failed to reach a verdict, the judge, Silas Reid, sentenced her to seven weeks in jail for contempt of court.\n\n\u201cThere are people who say that what he did was completely\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009justified, to separate the law and motivations,\u201d said Pritchard, but she felt the ban was \u201coutrageous\u201d. \u201cFor my understanding of the legal process, you go there to explain why you did what you did.\u201d\n\nPritchard received another jail sentence for criminal damage last year for cracking a window at a JPMorgan office.\n\nA report from Climate Rights International, a non-profit, in September also warned of heavy-handed treatment of climate protesters in Australia, the US, Germany, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing this [crackdown] in global north countries that have positioned themselves internationally as climate leaders,\u201d said Firmin. \u201cGovernments have closed down the space for protest.\u201d\n\nBut other senior figures said there was a balance to be struck. \u201cThere is a very wide envelope within which people can protest legitimately and lawfully,\u201d said Sir Robert Buckland, former lord chancellor and Conservative justice secretary.\n\n\u201cThe interests of freedom of speech are very important, but so are the rights and freedoms of other people who find their lives are disrupted.\u201d\n\nWhile officials argue that the crackdown is needed to deter protesters, it is also making some activists more resolute, said Linda Lakhdhir, legal director at Climate Rights International.\n\n\u201cMany protesters are going to worry more, think twice\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. [but] some people will think: \u2018If I have to go to jail, I will go to jail. I am doing this for the future of my children\u2019,\u201d she added.\n\nThat urgency has increased following the re-election of US President Donald Trump, who called climate change a hoax, said Dana Fisher, director of the Center for Environment, Community and Equity at American University. The US is the world\u2019s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cMovements actually work better when they\u2019re pushing back against a common enemy,\u201d she added.\n\nFisher said that historically social protest movements either \u201cpeter out and give up\u201d, often as their cause becomes less of an issue, or they \u201cradicalise until they achieve their goals\u201d, as was seen with the suffragettes and the civil rights movement.\n\nJust Stop Oil said the group expected more people to take to the streets as the effects of climate change became more apparent, and that Labour was not doing enough to tackle climate change.\n\n\u201cAs the consequences play out, as farming collapses, as millions are flooded and social order breaks down, as the risk of ruin becomes apparent the number of those prepared to act to defend our traditions, heritage and hard won rights will increase,\u201d the group said.\n\nMore than 1,000 people are expected to occupy the Strand outside the Royal Courts of Justice, where the appeal is being heard on Thursday lunchtime.\u00a0Television personalities Chris Packham and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and singer-songwriter Billy Bragg are among those due to attend.\n\nAhead of the appeal, XR spokesperson Zoe Cohen said: \u201cIt is shameful that the new government has not yet repealed these laws and restored the right of ordinary people to effective protest.

The previous plug-in car grant scheme, which paid out \u00a35,000 for an EV, was reduced over time and eventually scrapped in 2022 by the Conservative government.\n\nThe potential intervention on EVs comes after Labour chancellor Rachel Reeves weighed into a Supreme Court case to prevent the motor finance sector having to pay out billions in compensation to consumers.\n\nThe rise of pay-monthly deals for car purchases has transformed the country\u2019s auto finance sector. The most popular finance deal is called a \u201cpersonal contract purchase\u201d, which is a pay-monthly scheme that sees motorists finance the value a vehicle loses over three years rather than the total cost of the car.\n\nThe collapse in used prices for electric vehicles in the past two years means that EV repayments are typically higher than for petrol cars.\n\nAdrian Dally, FLA\u2019s motor finance director, said zero-interest loans would not fully equalise the cost between EVs and internal combustion vehicles, but he added: \u201cIf there was a way where the government could underwrite cheaper loans\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that would be extremely helpful.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the scheme on the public finances will depend on how the UK decides to structure any support.\u00a0Ministers hope that a change in the government\u2019s debt target to a new measure called \u201cpublic sector net financial liabilities\u201d \u2014 that counts more assets alongside public liabilities \u2014 could help the proposal.\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson declined to comment on the Financial Times report, but said 2024 was a \u201crecord year for switching to electric\u201d with 382,000 EVs sold and nearly 20,000 public chargers added to the network.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re investing over \u00a32.3bn to support industry and consumers make the switch.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6381ffbe-3d4b-4fdb-9a56-cf929b58cbfd"}}, {"id": "c42a36e2-9473-4e04-9dc7-1be1416edfd4", "event_name": "UK hopes of security deal with EU hit by fishing dispute", "blurb": "Member states\u2019 demand for a youth mobility scheme also bogging down \u2018reset\u2019 talks", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s plan to agree a security pact with the EU is being blocked by French and other member states\u2019 demands over fishing rights and a youth mobility scheme, complicating hopes of an early win in \u201creset\u201d talks with Brussels.\n\nIn recent weeks, UK efforts to sign a bilateral security and defence partnership with the European Commission have met growing opposition from EU capitals that want to link it to a broader package of agreements, officials from both sides said.\n\nA senior UK government official said: \u201cOver the last four or five weeks it has become clear that it won\u2019t happen without early assurances on fish and mobility.

But a positive signal for what?\u201d\n\nUK ambitions have until recently been limited to signing a veterinary agreement to reduce border red tape for animal and plant products, a deal for recognising professional qualifications and an accord to make it easier for touring artists to play in the EU.\n\nHowever, Britain has recently signalled it may go further, within its red lines, by looking to re-link the UK and EU\u2019s carbon markets and being open to joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention, a customs agreement between the EU and 20 countries.\n\nThe EU has made clear that a youth mobility agreement to allow for 18 to 30-year-olds to study and work in the UK \u2014 which Brussels is calling a youth experience scheme \u2014 is vital to any wider reset with the UK.\n\nStarmer has repeatedly ruled out such a deal, saying it would contradict Labour\u2019s election manifesto promise not to return to free movement of people that Brexit ended, but some UK ministers are privately confident a \u201clanding zone\u201d will be found.\n\nThe UK Cabinet Office said it would not provide a running commentary on reset talks, while noting the EU and Britain\u00a0faced a common set of security challenges.\n\n\u201cAs part of resetting our relationship with our European neighbours we\u00a0continue to\u00a0work towards strengthening co-operation on areas of mutual\u00a0benefit, such as on security,\u201d a spokesperson added.\n\nA French official said the position of Paris had long been that after Brexit the UK could not \u201ccherry pick\u201d parts of EU policy or regulation, and added that this stance was widely shared among member states.\n\n\u201cSecurity and defence cannot be separated from the rest,\u201d said the official, citing migration, energy, mobility and fishing as issues that also needed resolution before any security pact with the UK.\n\nOlof Gill, a European Commission spokesman, said: \u201cWe look forward to the UK defining its priorities, including on defence and security, and will engage on that basis.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Leila Abboud", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3fb38bd6-c1a3-4ba7-80d7-290d4bea06fb"}}, {"id": "f1d5cc28-aa9a-4ee3-822d-53e2b1ce2115", "event_name": "Can Rachel Reeves boost the UK\u2019s weak economic growth?

Output is likely to undershoot the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s outlook for 2025 as well, with the IMF predicting an expansion of 1.6 per cent in its latest outlook.\n\nOne of the factors dragging on growth was the UK\u2019s \u201cvery poor international trade performance\u201d, said Andrew Wishart, economist at Berenberg, with total exports falling while they held steady in other major economies. The UK\u2019s high production costs weighed on the export sector, he added, as companies face some of the highest electricity costs in the developed world alongside unusually big increases in labour costs.\n\nAt the same time, the leading services sector stopped contributing to overall growth. Services lifted growth at the start of 2024, with an expansion of 0.9 per cent in the first quarter, but registered no growth in the three months to September and the three months to November, the latest available data.\n\nAlan Taylor, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, has warned of \u201cebbing confidence\u201d due to a \u201ccash flow squeeze\u201d being felt by both businesses and households, in the form of tax hikes and continued high mortgage costs.\n\nBusiness groups say that elements of Labour\u2019s Budget in October made this uninspiring picture worse.\n\nReeves\u2019 decision to raise \u00a325bn via an increase in employer national insurance contributions, coupled with a sharp increase in the national living wage, has added to employment costs and dragged sharply on business sentiment.\n\nThere are increasing signs that businesses will shed staff as they attempt to keep costs under control. The S&P Global flash purchasing managers\u2019 survey last Friday showed the net share of businesses reducing staff numbers in January and December was the highest since the global financial crisis in 2009, apart from the start of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nSushil Wadhwani, a former Bank of England rate-setter, said Reeves had \u201clost the growth narrative\u201d partly as a result of the tax hike on businesses, adding that the decision had also muddied the labour market outlook for the BoE as it weighs how rapidly to cut interest rates.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot about animal spirits, and she damaged animal spirits,\u201d said Wadhwani.\n\nAll this comes in the context of a weak longer-term picture in the UK, in particular moribund productivity. Output per hour worked for April to June 2024 decreased by 0.9 per cent compared with the same quarter a year ago, according to the ONS.\n\nCompared with Q4 2019, before the pandemic, output per hour worked rose only by 0.8 per cent, according to the latest figures, well below the 2 per cent previously estimated. This is particularly weak compared with the US, where labour productivity rose by 8.3 per cent over the same period, buoyed by factors including strong corporate investment and a booming tech sector.\n\nBusiness investment has been lacklustre, particularly during a long period of stagnation following the Brexit referendum in 2016.\n\nIn the three months to September 2024, business investment was up 5.7 per cent compared with the same period the previous year, according to official data.\u00a0But it was up by the same amount in the eight years since early 2016, reflecting the lack of growth after the vote to leave the EU and the contraction during the pandemic.\n\nThis is a much weaker rate than in the US, where private non-residential fixed investment has risen by 40 per cent since 2016. And in the eight years before the Brexit referendum, UK business investment rose by about 26 per cent.\n\nReeves has been pledging radical changes to the UK\u2019s planning system to unlock more infrastructure projects and housebuilding, as well as reforms to better tap into pension savings.\n\nShe has been signalling her support for a third runway at Heathrow airport to boost connectivity, alongside support for a so-called\u00a0Oxford-Cambridge Arc that would bolster output in the science-rich region.\n\nAn industrial strategy focusing on key sectors including advanced manufacturing, creative industries such as film and TV, and financial services will follow in the spring.\n\nWith Donald Trump vowing to slash regulation in the US, the UK government has also been promising business it will hack away at red tape, including easing constraints on mortgage lending and a change of leadership at the competition regulator.\n\nA new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority has been announced to get to grips with endemic project delays.\n\nJim O\u2019Neill, a former Treasury minister and Goldman Sachs economist, said it was critical for the chancellor to convince the private sector that the UK\u2019s trend rate of growth can be lifted, and that meant explaining the value of her strategy to boost investment.\n\nThe poor growth rate reflects weak investment and productivity, said O\u2019Neill. \u201cHer framework in principle is designed to deal with that but they have to be serious about it and make sure anyone who will be a co-investor believes it.\u201d\n\nWadhwani said he doubted the short-term picture would improve unless Reeves \u201cbreaks the expectation\u201d that taxes will have to go up again given the weak state of the public finances.\n\nProgress in lowering barriers to trade with the EU, the UK\u2019s biggest market, would deliver a positive jolt to sentiment, he added.\n\nMichael Saunders, of Oxford Economics, said many of Reeves\u2019 policies on public and private investment made sense, but did not go far enough. The government needed to focus on bolstering investment in intangible assets, not just physical ones, he said.\n\nAnd it was likely to run up against shortages of construction workers given the breadth of its infrastructure and housing ambitions, he added, which meant devising a convincing labour force development plan.\n\n\u201cA broader strategy for potential growth is needed,\u201d he said. That means \u201cmaking the case for supply-side policies that pay off over 10 to 20 years\u201d.\n\nData visualisation by Keith Fray", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/54529cc8-7bf6-425c-8741-042d4eb08af0"}}, {"id": "5c668a1a-f449-44e5-9b6e-21a59620adfc", "event_name": "Dismay at plan to cut back A-level maths support programme", "blurb": "Reducing scheme credited with boosting maths performance in England is retrograde step, say critics ", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "The UK government is to cut back a hugely successful programme designed to encourage teenagers to take up higher-level maths courses, causing dismay among charities and campaign groups.\n\nThe Advanced Mathematics Support Programme, which has been running since 2018, helps state schools in England teach A-level maths, further maths and a core maths programme that provides \u201cmaths for life\u201d skills, such as statistics and finance.\n\nGovernment officials said the \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to reduce the programme budget had been taken as Whitehall sought to address the \u201c\u00a322bn black hole\u201d in the public finances Labour said it inherited from the Conservative administration.\n\nThe plan to halve the budget of the widely praised scheme from April this year was described as a retrograde step by leading maths campaigners at a time when the government was promoting its new AI and digital technology strategies as the key to the UK\u2019s growth prospects.\n\nJens Marklof, president of the London Mathematical Society, said the decision to pare back the scheme would harm the chances of children from poorer areas, where schools were less likely to offer further maths A-levels needed to access higher-tier universities.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no AI without maths and if the government is really serious about its AI strategy they have to significantly scale up the support for maths education at all levels,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe big success of AMSP was to enable kids who went to schools that didn\u2019t offer further maths to give them this opportunity,\u201d he added.\n\nSir Adrian Smith, Royal Society president, said it would be \u201cspectacularly short-sighted to pull funding from programmes designed to support teachers and schools to deliver better maths provision\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur maths education is not up to scratch \u2014 too many young people are leaving school without the skills they need for life or the well-paid jobs that will drive economic growth,\u201d he said.\n\nDan Abramson, chief executive of U-Maths, the umbrella organisation for university maths schools in England and professor of mathematics education at King\u2019s College London, said cutting the scheme risked halting two decades of progress on the take-up of maths.\n\n\u201cFor the UK to be at the forefront of AI and the data-driven modern economy, we need excellent mathematicians from all backgrounds, and we need more of them \u2014 that means more investment, not less,\u201d he said.\n\nThe maths scheme, which had a budget of \u00a317mn for the period July 2022-24, was part of a programme under the previous Conservative government to boost the take up of maths in schools.\n\nThe scheme, which is delivered by the charity Mathematics Education Innovation, provided assistance to schools to teach advanced maths, including online teaching support, training teachers and help for students to prepare for university entrance exams.\n\nIt was a successor programme to the Further Mathematics Support Programme established by Labour in 2009 to increase A-level maths participation. Both programmes are widely credited with a significant increase in the number of students taking A-level maths.\n\nEntries for maths A-level in England have risen from 64,500 in 2009 to more than 98,000 in 2024, while the number of students taking further maths increased from 9,400 to almost 17,000 over the same period.\n\nThe AMSP also drove an uptake in the core maths programme, which is offered alongside A-levels\n\nSince 2018, the number of students in England awarded certifications in core maths, a level 3 qualification for students who have chosen not to study A-level maths, has almost doubled from 6,600 to 12,500.\n\nThe Department for Education confirmed it was making the cuts, but said it was looking for alternatives. \u201cWe are looking at all options, including other sources of funding, to make sure that the most important parts of this programme can continue,\u201d a spokesperson added.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/aca9722c-27f7-44f6-9c67-81a33629a481"}}, {"id": "ce6cc2ac-e8c3-4f46-a609-0c56920d2265", "event_name": "Can I continue to invest in my future wife\u2019s company?", "blurb": "I\u2019m worried that being married to the owner will affect my eligibility to invest via SEIS", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "My partner and I got engaged over Christmas and we\u2019re excited to begin thinking about setting a date for the wedding. My wife-to-be is an entrepreneur and last year I invested in one of her small businesses through the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS), to help the business grow and for the tax advantages the scheme offers. I plan to make further such investments over the coming years. However, will being married to the owner affect my eligibility to invest via SEIS? Are there any alternative venture capital schemes I could use which offer tax relief?\n\nGuy Wilmot, partner in the corporate and commercial team at law firm Russell-Cooke, says rules around SEIS are notoriously complicated, so it is right to think about this in advance. Unfortunately, it is likely that when you are married the previous relief will be disapplied and you will not be able to make further SEIS (or EIS) investments in your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s company.\n\nSEIS relief is not available if an investor is \u201cconnected\u201d to the company they invest in. An investor will be treated as being connected if they, together with their associates, hold more than 30 per cent of the company\u2019s shares or voting rights.\n\nAn associate\u00a0under these rules\u00a0includes a spouse, parents and grandparents, children and grandchildren. As such, for the purposes of SEIS and EIS, a married couple are treated as a single unit. If that married unit holds more than 30 per cent of the company\u2019s shares, the relief is not available. It is worth bearing in mind that extended family members, such as aunts, uncles and even brothers and sisters, may still be eligible to invest under EIS or SEIS.\n\nEven if the shareholdings were below the threshold, it is still highly likely that the relief would not apply because employees of a company (and their associates) are also connected with that company.\n\nThe test of whether an investor is connected to a company applies for three years after the investment is made. If the test is breached within that period, then the previous relief may be withdrawn. As your investment was made last year, a delay in the marriage of potentially more than two years might be needed to avoid withdrawal of the relief, which perhaps takes tax planning to an extreme level, but is of course a personal choice.\n\nAs you plan your future with your fianc\u00e9e, one option could be to consider becoming a part owner of the business. Gifts of shares between spouses do not attract CGT and there may be suitable strategies you could consider for supporting the growth of what will soon be a family business, including use of capital allowances.\n\nNeedless to say, couples considering merging business and financial interests on marriage will probably wish to take appropriate family law advice, potentially including putting in place a suitable pre- or postnuptial agreement.\n\nIt\u2019s natural and common for entrepreneurs to turn to friends and family when getting their business ventures off the ground. But entering into a marriage does change the nature of the relationship, not only with the entrepreneur, but also with the business.\n\nI am 75, living with my wife. We have two daughters, the younger one living and working in London. She is hoping to buy a flat and we are trying to downsize to help her fund the purchase. I am aware of the seven-year inheritance tax (IHT) rule.\n\nHowever, to reduce IHT on the estate (of less than \u00a31mn) we are also considering putting the house into trust for the two girls.\u00a0If we did that, would that make the London daughter part-owner of the house and prevent her from gaining first-time buyer privileges?\n\nHarry Cousens, an associate in the private client and tax team at Withersworldwide, says that with regard to your inheritance tax exposure, you should be aware that\u00a0everyone has a \u201cnil rate band\u201d of \u00a3325,000 to set against the value of their estate.\u00a0Also, where a residence or interest in it is inherited by children, an additional nil rate band (the \u201cresidence nil rate band\u201d) of \u00a3175,000 is available, in certain circumstances, where the individual downsizes and assets of an equivalent value were left on death to direct descendants. This means that on your death, it may be possible for your daughters to inherit your estate IHT-free (on the basis that your estate is still worth \u00a31mn or less).\n\nNevertheless, it is understandable that you may wish to make a lifetime gift to your daughter to help her on to the property ladder.\u00a0For inheritance tax purposes, a gift to your daughter will be classed as a potentially exempt transfer (Pet).\n\nPets can become taxable at a maximum of 40 per cent if you die within seven years of the gift, with a tapering scale if you survive the gift by more than three years. You and your wife should consider which of you (or both) should make the Pet in light of this.\n\nHowever, if you were to die within seven years of the gift, as outlined above, you should have your nil rate band of \u00a3325,000 to set against the value of the gift and the residence nil rate band may provide further relief. In addition, there is the \u2018annual small gift exemption\u2019 of \u00a33,000.\n\nIf you sell your property, this will count as a disposal for capital gains tax, but provided the property is your only home that you have lived in throughout your period of ownership, principal private residence relief would apply and no capital gains tax would be payable.\n\nTurning to the question of a trust, whether settling your home will create a stamp duty issue for your daughters depends on the trust\u2019s terms. If the girls have a right to occupy the property and/or receive any rental income, then this would jeopardise the availability of first-time buyers\u2019 relief and it would also result in the additional property surcharge (now 5 per cent, following the Autumn Budget) applying to the purchase of a property by your daughters.\n\nHowever, settling your property on trust is unlikely to be a good idea for other reasons.\u00a0First, to the extent the property is valued higher than \u00a3650,000 (assuming both you and your wife have your full nil rate bands available), an immediate 20 per cent inheritance tax charge would apply to the creation of the trust.\u00a0Second, if you continue to occupy the property you have given away, anti-avoidance provisions would apply, and the property would be treated as remaining in your estate for inheritance tax purposes.\n\nUnder current rules, with a joint estate worth less than \u00a31mn, your daughters are unlikely to have any further inheritance tax to pay if you survive the Pet of the excess sale proceeds by seven years.\u00a0The opinions in this column are intended for general information purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice.

Eutelsat shares have lost three quarters of their value since the deal was announced.\n\nThe UK\u2019s government\u2019s injection of funds into Orbex represents half the \u00a340mn the company had been hoping for in a fundraising launched last year.\n\nIn total Orbex has raised \u00a323mn in the series D round, including investments from the Export and Investment Fund of Denmark, Octopus Ventures and private investor Sohaib Abbas.\n\nChambers said having the UK government as \u201cpart of the consortium will really bolster\u201d the final fundraising efforts.\n\nThe UK\u2019s support for Orbex will be welcomed by the UK space industry, which has criticised successive governments for a failure to develop a clear space strategy.\n\nIan Annett, former deputy chief executive of the UK Space Agency and now an independent consultant in the industry, said he supported the investment. \u201cIt is a clear signal of the intention to support a competitive launch industry within Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving assured access to space, whether for security, economic prosperity or science, will be an important asset for the UK.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, the latest year for which accounts are available, Orbex reported pre-tax losses more than doubled to \u00a317.2mn.\u00a0The company has raised a total of \u00a3129mn in public and private funding since it was founded in 2015.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5ed95ee5-fb27-47a0-b461-45749066dde8"}}, {"id": "dd06857b-6f16-477e-8928-921da4e96c37", "event_name": "Rachel Reeves to warn that UK must \u2018fight\u2019 for economic growth  ", "blurb": "Chancellor will use keynote speech to signal she wants to face down opponents of development", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will promise to go \u201cfurther and faster\u201d to kick-start the UK economy in a major speech on Wednesday, as she tries to convince business that the government is committed to driving growth.\n\nReeves will signal she is prepared to have a \u201cfight\u201d with opponents \u2014 including environmentalists \u2014 who stand in the way of the government\u2019s planning reforms.\n\nThe chancellor is under pressure to reassure companies and investors after her tax-raising Budget in October, the government\u2019s package of employment reforms, and a rise in gilt yields amid fears about stagflation.\n\nReeves will confirm that the government is reviving plans for an \u201cOxford-Cambridge growth corridor\u201d as part of a broader push to liberalise the planning regime and ensure more homes are built.\n\nThe chancellor will also emphasise progress on an industrial strategy and signal her support for airport expansion in Greater London.\n\n\u201cFor too long we have accepted low expectations, accepted stagnation,\u201d Reeves will say in her speech. \u201cLow growth is not our destiny.

They are based on an assumption of long-term net international migration of 340,000 people a year from mid-2028 onwards, up from previous projections of 315,000.\n\nJonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cThese projections are almost certainly overstated since they do not appear to take account of the sharp fall in net migration that is already under way, as we know from the separate statistics on visas issued.\u201d\n\nONS figures published last November showed net migration to the UK exceeded 900,000 in the year to June 2023, the highest annual total on record, but fell by 20 per cent in the 12 months to June 2024.\n\nPortes added that the ONS figures published on Tuesday assumed that fertility would stabilise \u201cwhereas in recent years it has been falling significantly\u201d. The ONS now assumes a long-term fertility rate of 1.45, down from 1.59 in the previous projections.\n\nThe latest figures showed that the fertility rate in England and Wales fell to 1.44 children per woman in 2023, the lowest since comparable data began in 1938.\n\nThe number of children aged under 15 years is projected to decrease by 797,000, from 12.4mn to 11.6mn, by mid-2032, according to the ONS.\n\nOn the other hand, the number of people of pensionable age is projected to increase by 1.7mn over the same period, or 14 per cent, from 12.0mn to 13.7mn, taking into account the planned increases in state pension age to 67 years for both sexes.\n\nThe UK\u2019s projected population growth contrasts with the population already shrinking in many countries, including Italy, Japan, and China. The German population is also expected to start shrinking in the next few years, according to UN population forecasts.\n\nIn the outlook to 2047, the ONS said that \u201cnet migration is projected to be the only source of population growth in the UK over the next 25 years\u201d.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e064ce02-8ba5-45d7-84fa-c56ea8b427b1"}}, {"id": "1c25db9d-62ca-408d-8ba3-9acf965bed71", "event_name": "How Oxford and Cambridge spinouts could boost UK growth ", "blurb": "The path from ivory towers to commercialisation is fraught and clearer ground rules are needed", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Running trains between Oxford and Cambridge to create a bigger research and development hub \u2014 as per plans revived by the UK government \u2014 is one way to foster economic growth. Easing the path for universities to spin out their innovations into business opportunities would be even smarter.\n\nTrue, the UK beats its European peers when it comes to commercialising research birthed in university labs. The country\u2019s universities have spawned more than 2,000 spinouts since 2011, according to the Royal Academy of Engineering. Stars include Carbon Re, an industrial artificial intelligence company, spun out of Cambridge and University College London.\n\nBut the path from ivory towers to commercialisation is fraught. Last year\u2019s equity investment of \u00a32.6bn, according to the Royal Academy of Engineering, ended a two-year decline but is still below the 2021 peak. That\u2019s about a 10th of the equity raised in the UK capital markets.\n\nClearer ground rules would help. Universities, founders and investors clash frequently. All would agree that value resides in intellectual property, but where the IP itself resides is a knottier issue. At Cambridge, the university gets first dibs. Compare that with Sweden\u2019s Uppsala University, which usually confers ownership on the originator. One case, involving the University of Oxford, wound up in court.\n\nThat is just one hurdle. Extricating spinouts can be laborious; academia moves slowly. As the UK government\u2019s 2023 review noted, panels are composed of committees that only meet irregularly and lack commercial experts. The average spinout took 10-12 months; for 16 per cent it was more than 16 months.\n\nUniversities are reluctant to cede much of their innovations: one in four spinouts began negotiations demanding a 50 per cent equity stake. Investors balk at being accorded just crumbs. This is improving \u2014 the average university equity stake at spinout fell to 18 per cent in 2023, from 25 per cent a decade ago \u2014 but there is scope for further loosening of the reins.\n\nAttracting and retaining human capital is a priority, and the UK is not alone in finding this challenging. Even the US, start-up central, is seeing STEM brains return to China; blockchain researcher Chen Jing is just the latest to forsake the US for Beijing\u2019s Tsinghua University.\n\nStructural challenges remain for the UK. Many universities are broke; nearly all lack the generous endowments that buoy the coffers of US institutions. There are limits to the amount of money that can be poured into the type of research projects that could be spun out.\n\nBut innovation is flourishing in the country\u2019s seats of learning, as is the government will to overcome constraints. Add in the trains and the UK just might have found a recipe for growth.\n\nlouise.lucas@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nThriv\u00ading uni\u00adversity spin\u00adouts must not be an Oxbridge pre\u00adserve / From Professor Nick Jennings, Vice-Chancellor & President, Loughborough University", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/70ba190d-5c11-4bed-8bf3-77759d77e8e6"}}, {"id": "7086e8cc-bc4d-438d-ac20-1309d544bd3e", "event_name": "To seize AI\u2019s benefits, ministers must be prepared to fail in public ", "blurb": "DeepSeek\u2019s lower costs bode well for Keir Starmer, but government needs to be more open about its use of AI ", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning. DeepSeek, a small Chinese artificial intelligence lab, has stunned the world and sent US tech stocks tumbling after unveiling its new R1 reasoning model. Its cheaper cost than rivals has called into question the business model of some of the big early players in AI.\n\nBut those lower overheads are good news for governments \u2014 including that of Keir Starmer \u2014 hoping that AI will allow them to trim the costs of public administration. If there is \u201cno moat\u201d in AI then governments stand to save money on paying for staff without having to lose the same money to high costs for one company\u2019s large language model or another.\n\nMinisters in the previous government of Rishi Sunak and that of Starmer rave about some private companies and the products they make. But Sunak recognised, rightly, that government needed to build its own sovereign capacity in AI, hence the thing likely to be his biggest positive legacy to the UK: the Incubator for Artificial Intelligence (i.AI). The AI unit in the Cabinet Office was launched in November 2023 in the hopes of expediting how information was compiled from different departments and allowing officials to make faster decisions. DeepSeek\u2019s success is a positive indicator for the UK and for all governments that want to do the same.\n\nIn addition to costs, the development in AI will also involve some big cultural changes in government. Some thoughts on one of them in today\u2019s note.\n\nLast week, the government unveiled a series of new tools that, it says, will make government run faster for less. Consult is designed to use AI to reduce the cost of running consultations with stakeholders by cutting the time allocated to a civil service task that ordinarily requires hours and hours. Ministers launch about 700-800 consultations a year. Parlex and Lex (no, not that Lex) both support in researching legislation but also model how MPs might react to a policy issue.\n\nAll of these and more are designed to do the same thing: reduce the amount of time the civil service spends on administrative tasks that do not require a human brain and reduce the amount of policy work that gets done on projects that will never be signed off by a special adviser or a minister.\n\nAlthough such technology is new, the spin is very, very old in that these are all the fruits of things that Sunak established as prime minister. Taking advantage of the good things your predecessor did is a long-standing political trick. The tools are also pretty much all in either alpha (ie \u201cwe aren\u2019t sure if this works\u201d) or beta stage (ie \u201cwe don\u2019t know how much help it actually is now we\u2019ve got it to work\u201d).\n\nPart of seizing the benefits of AI and digital government more broadly is transparency about what you\u2019re doing, why you\u2019re doing it and what is working and isn\u2019t. And one of the unalloyed positives about digital government in the UK has been the capacity to not only publish data on the outcomes of government efforts but also to show its working.\n\nA good thing about i.AI is that it has had a long history of failures: if you are not failing most of the time you either a) aren\u2019t really innovating or b) aren\u2019t being transparent about what you are doing or, worst of all c) you are releasing a lot of projects for public use that don\u2019t work to save face.\n\nThere\u2019s an inevitable tension here that goes right to the heart of why governments are less nimble than private companies. As a taxpayer I want both national and local government to innovate, experiment, and be prepared to get things wrong to deliver better public services. As someone who uses public services, I want those services to work first time.\n\nAnd governments of all stripes are incentivised not to fail publicly, even at development stage. As a result, government programmes are often \u201cdoomed to succeed\u201d: something that is announced, whether as an old-fashioned pilot programme or a newfangled beta test, is incentivised to progress to a proper rollout. That\u2019s because governments are beaten up for failing.\n\nThe negative headlines arising from the government\u2019s difficulties in getting AI models that actually work in the Department for Work and Pensions are a case in point (as reported by Robert Booth over at the Guardian). My concern here isn\u2019t that the government has had many unsuccessful pilots: that is a good thing, and part of government seizing the benefits of AI is going to be trying things at pilot stage that don\u2019t work. My worry is that the story emerged through a freedom of information request. Government needs to shake off its old, old addiction to failing in secrecy if it is going to get the benefits both of sharing knowledge about how AI works with households and businesses, and for us to trust how governments use AI.\n\nThis week, I mostly listened to Emma Rawicz\u2019s Chroma while writing my column.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/003062b2-eb5c-42a9-8361-9211ed7a45ee"}}, {"id": "f0fea2d1-907e-4541-af03-feee03ebfaf0", "event_name": "Keir Starmer vows to \u2018hard wire growth\u2019 into cabinet decisions", "blurb": "Changes will require UK ministers to prove economic impact of policies before approval", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Sir Keir Starmer has promised to \u201chard wire growth into all decisions in the cabinet\u201d, as he set out what he called a new approach to policymaking at a meeting with senior executives in the City of London.\n\nDowning Street said that in future all cabinet ministers would have to \u201cset out the growth credentials of new policies in order to get approval from their cabinet colleagues\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cgrowth impact of proposals will be subject to the same rigorous assessment that already applies to new public spending\u201d, No 10 added.\n\nStarmer\u2019s change to the Whitehall \u201cwrite round\u201d process for cabinet decisions \u2014 in which cabinet ministers are consulted on new policies \u2014 is intended to focus attention on the growth potential of new policies.\n\n\u201cEverything has to be seen through the question of whether it is pro-growth,\u201d Starmer told business executives on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe message came as chancellor Rachel Reeves prepared to give a speech on growth on Wednesday in which she will signal support for a third runway at Heathrow airport, a policy previously opposed by senior cabinet members, as well as the prime minister himself.\n\nStarmer and Reeves on Tuesday met executives in the City of London, where both adopted a notably bullish tone on the prospects for the British economy, in stark contrast to their gloomy rhetoric last year.\n\nBusiness leaders had warned that Reeves\u2019 insistence that she had been handed by the Conservatives \u201cthe worst economic inheritance\u201d of any UK government since the second world war had sucked confidence out of the economy.\n\nThey have also criticised the Labour government for introducing measures that executives say will hit growth, including a \u00a325bn national insurance increase on employers and new labour laws.\n\nAt a round-table breakfast, Reeves adopted a markedly more bullish tone than last year. \u201cIt\u2019s the role of government to shout about all the amazing things we are doing as a country,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe want to partner with you in business to showcase all the great things we have going for us,\u201d she added.\n\nReeves will use her speech on Wednesday to promise to go \u201cfurther and faster\u201d on growth, including greenlighting airport expansion in the south-east, a move that has caused unrest in Labour circles.\n\nIn the last House of Commons vote on a third runway at Heathrow in 2018, seven members of the current cabinet voted against it, including Starmer.

One answer is that these acts shake our sense of what it means to be human. That Axel Rudakubana could murder three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport last year, or that Salman Abedi could blow himself up at a Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in 2017, killing 22 people, many of them children, is incomprehensible to most of us. That someone could set out one day with the intent to murder and kill isn\u2019t something we can get our heads around.\n\nAbedi\u2019s horrific crimes are no easier to justify but they are, I think, easier to categorise and explain. Abedi was a jihadist extremist who believed that his murders would advance his cause. He was a man who convinced himself that his ends justified his violent and heinous means. Rudakubana is harder to understand: for him, his violent means were his ends. The Southport murders are shocking in part because we can\u2019t categorise them.\n\nRudakubana confounds us because he is beyond our imagination. I think we can all imagine what it would be to be a fanatic. We all believe in something and we can at least conceive of, if not fully understand, what it means to be willing to kill the innocent in the service of an idea. We can imagine, too, what it might mean to lose our reason and to commit horrific crimes due to a psychotic break.\n\nThe idea of someone first convincing themselves of the rightness of their cause online and then turning to violent means to advance it does not lie beyond our comprehension. But we struggle to understand someone for whom viewing violent acts online is in itself a source of motivation \u2014 a person who could view the horrors of the world and decide that they wanted to add to them simply because of a fascination with violence.\n\nCategorising extreme violence is also how governments degrade, undermine and defeat those who wish to commit it. In the UK, where Islamist extremism makes up 75 per cent of the counterterror caseload in Great Britain (together with a growing threat from the extreme right), understanding the ideologies that drive or justify acts of extreme violence is part of how we stop them. Doing so helps us decide when events might require extra security, or which individuals might need enhanced monitoring. It tells us where they might attack, and it helps our security services infiltrate and undermine organised terrorism.\n\nThat is part of how MI5 and the police have managed to foil 43 \u201clate stage\u201d terror plots since 2017. It is also how Prevent, another strand in the UK\u2019s counterterrorism strategy, has diverted many more away from the cause of terrorism.\n\nBut it is much harder to work out how to tackle and stop someone like Rudakubana who commits violent acts seemingly for violence\u2019s sake. His motivations are still further from our own than those of someone who commits horrific acts for an ideological reason.\n\nSo some \u2014 not least the UK prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer \u2014 think that the way to deal with what Christopher Wray, former director of the FBI, dubbed \u201csalad bar extremism\u201d, a pick and mix of incomprehensible rationales and ideological justifications for extreme violence, is to change the state\u2019s definition of terrorism. How a state, particularly a liberal democracy, defines terrorism matters because states sometimes use that definition to suspend some or all of the safeguards that define liberal democracies in the first place. But as Jonathan Hall, the UK\u2019s independent reviewer, has argued persuasively in these pages, one effect of expanding the definition of terrorism would be to significantly increase the number of areas in which we reduce and curtail the rights of individuals.\n\nWhat really matters is not how the British state has categorised Islamist extremism and the extreme right, but its understanding of what drives them \u2014 what their centres of power are and how to undermine them. Such an understanding is what has allowed the security services to defeat extreme animal rights activists, whose activities used to blight and terrorise scientific researchers.\n\nTo defeat violence for violence\u2019s sake, we need to understand what drives it in the way that we have at least begun to understand ideologically and religiously-driven acts of extreme violence. As strange and alien as extreme violence seems to us, we have to find a way to make it comprehensible if we are to protect ourselves from it. Although it will always remain hard for us to understand the acts of extremists, it is only through deeper understanding that we will be able to find greater security.\n\nstephen.bush@ft.com", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3445b327-a3d7-47ed-87f3-6a872a4f2ee6"}}, {"id": "f2757a2f-aa79-4e38-813f-188f8cfee6fb", "event_name": "UK competition agency will make \u2018rapid decisions\u2019, new chair says ", "blurb": "Newly installed Doug Gurr wants to improve relations with industries and spur investment ", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "The UK\u2019s competition regulator will speed up its investigations in order to try to unlock greater investment into the country, the newly installed chair of the regulator has said.\n\nWriting in the Financial Times, Doug Gurr said the agency would make its merger and market investigations \u201cas simple and rapid as possible\u201d.\n\nThe CMA will also bring in greater sector expertise so that businesses do not have to waste time educating the regulator about their industry.\n\n\u201cWe know it costs businesses when they have to deal with lengthy and uncertain investigations,\u201d he said. \u201cGood decisions, clear decisions, rapid decisions \u2014 that\u2019s what you tell us you need and that\u2019s on us to deliver.\u201d\n\nGurr, the former head of Amazon UK, was named as the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s interim chair last week, after former chair Marcus Bokkerink was ousted by ministers.\n\nHe wrote that \u201ca regulatory environment that encourages the greatest possible\u00a0level of business investment\u201d would be the agency\u2019s new \u201cnorth star\u201d, while also stressing the need to protect consumers.\n\nGurr ran Amazon\u2019s British operations during the tech group\u2019s tussle with the CMA over its minority investment in Deliveroo and is expected to take a more friendly approach towards business.\n\nThe CMA was previously criticised for being too interventionist, with its delay in approving Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision seen as damaging the UK\u2019s standing internationally.\n\n\u201cLast year, the UK again delivered the lowest level of business investment in the G7.

She has also supported Britain aligning permanently with EU rules in established industries such as chemicals.\n\nShe said she was \u201cabsolutely happy\u201d to look at the idea of Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention, a customs agreement between the EU and 20 countries, including in the Middle East and Balkans.\n\nIt comes as EU diplomats warned that unless Starmer showed more ambition, his reset would do little to boost the UK economy. \u201cNone of this would have any impact on growth,\u201d said one.\n\nLabour\u2019s general election manifesto last year ruled out Britain rejoining the single market, customs union or adopting free movement, but Starmer and Reeves are now looking to show that the reset can yield economic gains.\n\nOne senior UK government official said: \u201cBritish business wants to avoid any kind of cliff edge or extra costs. We are looking for win-win solutions to build confidence and relinking our carbon markets falls into that category.\u201d\n\nThe UK government has been under mounting pressure from industry to announce it will align its ETS scheme with that of the EU in order to remove additional border bureaucracy. There are also growing concerns, for example in the steel industry, about the impact of a decision to introduce the UK\u2019s CBAM in 2027 \u2014 a full year later than the EU tax.\n\nAdam Berman, director of policy at lobby group Energy UK, said relinking the UK and EU carbon markets was \u201cthe only solution that protects British industry from the incoming EU CBAM.

A leaked internal document setting out the EU\u2019s negotiating positions last month said the majority of EU states were open to linkage, but on condition that the UK submitted to \u201cfull dynamic alignment\u201d with EU law, which would require the UK to replicate relevant EU legislation on the UK statute book.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s administration has indicated it views carbon border taxes as discriminatory and that they could be subject to retaliation under plans the US president has ordered to be drawn up \u201cwithin 60 days\u201d.\n\nSir Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat leader, has urged Starmer to be more ambitious with his UK-EU reset, and wants Britain to rejoin the customs union.\n\n\u201cIt is clear they are ready to talk seriously, they are worried about Trump too,\u201d he told the Financial Times. \u201cThis is the moment for Labour to take a risk, be ambitious and go for a deal that can actually jump-start the economy.\u201d\n\nLabour\u2019s manifesto set out limited ambitions for a reset, including a deal to facilitate trade in animal and plant products, the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and a deal to allow UK artists to tour freely across the EU.\n\nBrussels will demand a number of concessions from the UK in exchange for any deal, including continued access to British fishing waters. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing without fish,\u201d said one EU official.\n\nThe EU is also demanding a bilateral \u201cyouth experience scheme\u201d to allow under-30s to be able to travel and work in the UK and the bloc.

Without growth, there is no money to support the rebuilding of\u00a0our vital public services and no prosperity for hardworking people and families.\n\nBut what drives growth? And how can a regulator like the CMA play a part? Well, we know that dynamic, competitive markets drive growth. But another thing we know for sure is that business investment drives growth and that here in the UK we struggle with\u00a0business investment.\n\nLast year, the UK again delivered the lowest level of business investment in the G7. This has been true for far too long. And this is where the CMA comes in \u2014 because in my experience, there are many factors in any investment decision but a big one is confidence in a stable, coherent and well-informed regulatory environment.\n\nThis is our north star: a regulatory environment that encourages the greatest possible\u00a0level of business investment, subject to respecting the absolute importance of healthy competition and strong consumer protection. We want both domestic and international businesses to see the UK as a great place to invest.\n\nThis means giving start-ups and\u00a0venture backers the confidence to launch their businesses here, not elsewhere in the world. It means encouraging multinationals \u2014 who have a pretty much free\u00a0choice to place their investments anywhere in the Emea timezone \u2014 to choose the UK.\u00a0And it means giving our domestic businesses the encouragement and confidence to get\u00a0on and invest.\n\nWhat does that mean in practice and what is the CMA going to do differently? Well, here are three simple \u2014 but powerful \u2014 things we want to drive forward.\n\nFirst, efficiency: we have to make our investigations and processes as simple and rapid\u00a0as possible. We know it costs businesses when they have to deal with lengthy and uncertain investigations. Good decisions, clear decisions, rapid decisions \u2014 that\u2019s what you tell us you need and that\u2019s on us to deliver.\u00a0We\u2019re already off to a great start with the \u201c4Ps\u201d framework announced by our CEO late last year. Proportionality, predictability, process and pace are all critical areas for us to dig into and I am confident we can make real progress in the near future.\n\nSecond, expertise: the CMA has a wealth of talent and a committed workforce. But we\u00a0also know businesses can find it frustrating when they feel they have to spend their time educating us about their sector dynamics and issues. And, of course, the deeper our understanding, the better the decisions we make will be. So, once again, we\u2019ve\u00a0listened. We will build mechanisms to ensure we invest in, and can access, world\u00a0class expertise to enable a rapid, meaningful and grown-up conversation with every sector we investigate.\n\nFinally, engagement. Ultimately, we serve UK consumers. But our work has a direct impact on businesses across the UK and those looking to grow and invest here. So it\u2019s essential we engage directly and meaningfully with the business community. Our commitment is an open door, open ears and open minds.\n\nWe\u2019re not naive and we\u2019ll never move away from a belief in the power of competition and consumer\u00a0protection. But we want to hear what works for you \u2014 what\u2019s going to give you the confidence\u00a0to invest. We\u2019re looking forward to the first meeting of the CMA\u2019s Growth and Investment Council today to do just that.\u00a0The council was launched at the start of this year and brings together the leaders of 12 major UK business and investor groups.\n\nWe love the UK.

In the process, 750 homes and a primary school would be demolished.\n\nOther options, such as a smaller third runway within the airport\u2019s current boundaries, are not being considered, the people said, in part because the northwestern runway project has been through six years of scrutiny and was backed\u00a0by a government-appointed\u00a0Airports Commission in 2015, parliament in 2018 and the Supreme Court in 2020.\n\nThe biggest unknown is the project\u2019s price tag. A third runway at Heathrow would be one of the most expensive private sector infrastructure projects in the UK. The estimated cost was \u00a314bn in 2014, but that number would now be far higher.\n\nNoble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, said the costs had been rising quickly, and there were now questions over whether the UK had the construction skills to deliver a project of that size.\n\nA third runway would compete for workers with the government\u2019s plans to build 1.5mn homes over five years, as well as more transport and water infrastructure, data centres and gigafactories.\n\nThe number of people working in construction has fallen by 366,000 in the past five years and is at its second-lowest level since 2001.\n\n\u201cThe big question in construction is who will actually do all the work and how much more will it cost,\u201d Francis said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unclear whether we have the skills.\u201d\n\nAviation industry executives believe the expansion is so politically and technically challenging that Heathrow will want Reeves to go beyond simply signalling her approval for the idea of a third runway this week.\n\nThe airport\u2019s management will want clarity on how the government\u2019s planning reforms could smooth the way, including potential delays caused by judicial reviews, and a commitment to redrawing the UK\u2019s airspace to fit in all the new flights.\n\nBut, most of all, the government will need to agree to reform how Heathrow is financed.\n\nAs a regional monopoly, the airport is funded via the regulated asset base model much like the water companies, which raise equity and debt and recover the costs from consumers.\n\nHeathrow is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority, which agrees every five years on how much can be recouped from the take-off and landing charges it levies on airlines. These charges and the cost of servicing Heathrow\u2019s debt, at present about \u00a319bn, are passed on to passengers.\n\nHeathrow and its airline customers agree the airport\u2019s charging model needs to be reformed, but do not agree on how.\n\nOne option would be a far longer charging cycle \u2014 potentially as much as 25 years \u2014 to run alongside the current system to help pay for the runway.\n\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of lobby group Airlines UK, said carriers backed growth, but it must be \u201caffordable, aligned with industry\u2019s net zero commitments and deliver meaningful improvements in operational resilience\u201d.\n\nThe airport\u2019s next steps would be to submit a planning application for expansion, which would need to be granted a \u201cdevelopment consent order\u201d by the transport secretary.\n\nWhile there are live DCO applications for the Gatwick and Luton expansions, Heathrow\u2019s plans are not as advanced.\n\nSome experts believe the challenges of building a third runway are so significant that the project will never get off the ground.\n\nThe government has previously said no runway expansion would be authorised unless it is compatible with meeting Britain\u2019s climate targets, complies with noise pollution and air pollution limits and provides economic growth across the country.\n\nPaul McGuinness, chair of the No 3rd Runway Coalition pressure group, said: \u201cExpansions at other London airports undermine the case for Heathrow\u2019s uniquely complicated and costly third runway, making it an even riskier, if not uninvestable proposition.\u201d\n\nSir Keir Starmer, prime minister, voted against the scheme in 2018. Sir Sadiq Khan, Labour mayor of London, last week said that if Heathrow came back \u201cwith plans for a new runway that was supported by the government, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to launch, with partners and colleagues, another legal challenge\u201d.\n\nThe airport\u2019s new board met last week, following a change in its ownership, in which French private equity group Ardian and Saudi Arabia\u2019s deep-pocketed sovereign wealth fund bought a 38 per cent stake.\n\nThe board was supportive of expanding the airport in principle, ahead of hearing more details from Reeves, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nTony Travers, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, said it was a key moment for the government.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe scale of opposition to a third runway at Heathrow means the chancellor\u2019s renewed interest in it poses the ultimate test of the government\u2019s commitment to growth. Drive a third runway through, and pretty much any planning obstacle can be overcome.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/805085cc-eedb-4cd7-84da-60878599ba3f"}}, {"id": "507763ba-3d78-4a8b-b029-4c0a76d98454", "event_name": "Scottish state bank risks missing 2030 investment target ", "blurb": "SNIB faces potential shortfall of \u00a3400mn on \u00a32bn lending budget, estimates show ", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "The Scottish National Investment Bank is at risk of missing its target of investing \u00a32bn by the end of the decade by a fifth, after the government scaled back funding for the lender this year.\n\nThe state bank could fall short of its 2030 goal in three areas \u2014 net zero, communities and innovation \u2014 by as much as \u00a3400mn, according to previously unreported figures from its annual report.\n\nEstablished in 2020, the bank has a mandate to fund projects that cut carbon emissions, reduce inequality and promote innovation.

From April 1, the level at which the property levy becomes payable reverts to \u00a3300,000 from \u00a3425,000 for first-time buyers and to \u00a3125,000 from \u00a3250,000 for others.\n\nThe renters\u2019 rights bill, which aims to reform the private rental sector and end \u201cno fault\u201d evictions, could also affect the market.

Less than \u00a370bn is eligible to be returned to companies under current rules. Total assets in the system are \u00a31.2tn.\n\n\u201cThis reform has the potential to fundamentally change the way employers view their defined-benefit pension schemes, transforming them from liabilities to offload, into valuable assets worth running on for the longer term,\u201d said Morten Nilsson, chief executive of Brightwell, which manages the BT pension scheme, the largest in the FTSE 100. BT\u2019s scheme is in deficit.\n\nAfter several weeks in which chancellor Rachel Reeves has made a series of growth-related announcements, Starmer\u2019s move on Tuesday will be an answer to critics that he has taken a back seat on the economy.\n\n\u201cTo achieve the change our country needs requires nothing short of rewiring our economy,\u201d Starmer will tell the bosses of Lloyds, Nationwide and Tesco, along with other executives. \u201cIt needs creative reform, the removal of hurdles and unrelenting focus.\u201d\n\nThe pension reforms follow criticism from some business leaders that Starmer and Reeves have undermined growth with a \u00a340bn Budget tax rise, a thicket of new employment laws and gloomy rhetoric.\n\nHunt floated the defined-benefit pension reforms in his 2023 Mansion House speech but ran out of time to deliver them before last year\u2019s election, which delivered Starmer and Labour into power.\n\n\u201cI may have my political differences with Rachel Reeves on business tax rises but I strongly welcome the momentum she has put behind the Mansion House reforms,\u201d Hunt told the Financial Times.\n\nUnder Labour\u2019s plans, DB schemes could change their rules to permit surplus extraction where the employer and the trustees of the pension scheme agree. The plans would require legislation.\n\nCurrently, DB scheme surplus can only be accessed where schemes passed a resolution by 2016 to retain the power, under a 2004 law passed by the last Labour government. Some schemes had large deficits and did not pass such resolutions.\n\nSurpluses are also only accessible if they exceed the level needed for a business to sell its scheme to an insurer. The UK\u2019s Pension Protection Fund estimates that \u00a368bn of the \u00a3160bn of the total current surplus meets this threshold.\n\nAround \u00a3180mn of surplus was accessed by companies between 2018 to 2023, according to government estimates last year. Businesses are taxed at 25 per cent on surpluses they receive.\n\nPension scheme funding levels have improved dramatically in recent years because higher government bond yields have increased expected returns on assets, therefore reducing the current accounting value of future liabilities.\n\nPension trustees welcomed the government\u2019s announcement, provided member outcomes were protected.\n\n\u201cAll trustees really care about is paying scheme members, but as a general theme we would be supportive of releasing surpluses in the right circumstances,\u201d said Vassos Vassou, council member of the Association of Professional Pension Trustees.\n\nHe noted that in recent years, companies with large surpluses in their pension schemes had opted to sell them to insurance companies in bulk annuity transactions called buyouts. About \u00a350bn of pension obligations have been sold in each of the past two years, according to consultancy WTW.\n\nSome advisers are sceptical that many companies will make use of Labour\u2019s reforms. \u201cI just don\u2019t think there will be many people who want to do it \u2014 either they want to do a buyout or just put more money into the scheme until they can,\u201d said John Ralfe, an independent pensions consultant. He noted the 25 per cent tax levied on cash extracted from pension surpluses.\n\nOn Monday Reeves urged Labour MPs to get behind the growth strategy, with some backbenchers nervous that the party is damaging its environmental credentials and appearing to side with business over consumer interests.\n\n\u201cIf we get this right \u2014 and I know we will \u2014 the prize on offer is immense,\u201d she told the Parliamentary Labour party.

In a similar forecast this time last year, it predicted Britain would have 17GW of onshore wind, 31GW of offshore wind and 21GW of solar by 2030.\n\nLast year\u2019s figures for offshore wind and solar were lower than its new predictions, suggesting the government\u2019s policies will have made some difference.\n\nHowever, Cornwall cautioned that the forecasts were not directly comparable because of changes to the way it carried out its modelling.\n\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said it did \u201cnot recognise\u201d the forecasts, pointing to NESO analysis that showed \u201cclean power by 2030 is achievable\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are cleaning up a dysfunctional grid system to connect the most important projects, speeding up decisions on planning permission and expanding the renewable auction process to stop delays, unlocking growth\u201d.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5d1451ac-ec64-4616-8ac9-36acd26f8939"}}, {"id": "ec57c1bd-2e7b-4e02-9220-3f479bfb97aa", "event_name": "Kemi Badenoch\u2019s post-Southport argument is worrying", "blurb": "Tory seems to put prior convictions ahead of specific facts at a time of potential UK counter-terrorism strategy overhaul ", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning. What should we be talking about in the wake of the Southport murders?\n\nOn Friday, I set out why Axel Rudakubana did not fit into either of the British state\u2019s models for dealing with people who might end committing crimes such as his. For people with specific mental illnesses, hopefully they end up being detained under the terms of the Mental Health Act. And for people who would kill for a cause, hopefully they are spotted by Prevent and dissuaded from supporting or committing terrorist acts. (Or they are stopped and arrested before carrying out a terrorist plot.)\n\nWhether the UK\u2019s approach to identifying and combating terrorism should change as a result, and if so how, are going to be a topic of serious debate over the coming days, weeks and months. We expect the imminent publication of the review into when Rudakubana came into contact with Prevent and what the counter-terrorism programme could have done differently. I will set out my thinking on it once I\u2019ve digested the report.\n\nFor now I want to talk about the arguments advanced by the leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch, that what we really should be talking about in the wake of these murders is \u201cintegration\u201d, partly because some of what she is missing is important to my concerns about the broader criticisms being made of the UK\u2019s Prevent programme. Some more on that below.\n\nAxel Rudakubana was born and raised in the UK. His parents, who were Tutsis who had left Rwanda before the genocide, were Christians (like 92 per cent of people in Rwanda). They were both churchgoers. As an 11-year-old, he appeared in a commercial for Children in Need dressed as Doctor Who. But as he entered his teenage years, something changed. He became obsessed with violence. He came into contact with various bits of the state, none of which spotted the danger that he posed.\n\nSo when Kemi Badenoch says \u201cit is absurd that we are debating online knife sales more than we are integration and how we safeguard our societies from ideologies and violence\u201d, it is hard, frankly, to see how that relates to this case.\n\nIn terms of the broader question of \u201chow do we keep British citizens safe from terror\u201d, yes. According to the most recent data release, there were 234 people in prison in Great Britain for terrorism-connected offences. Of those, 65 per cent are categorised as holding Islamist-extremist views, 27 per cent are categorised as following extreme rightwing ideologies. The remainder hold \u201cOther\u201d ideologies \u2014 mostly causes that have been the inspiration for terrorism in the recent past, such as animal rights. Their threat has, for the moment, been pretty comprehensively dismantled by counter-terrorism police and the security services.\n\nSafeguarding the UK from ideologically motivated terrorism is a much bigger deal and challenge than random acts of violence motivated by obsession with violence, at least at the moment. Identifying and tackling problems of ideology is both what Prevent is set up to do, but it is also how we distinguish between terrorism and all other forms of crime.\n\nAnd indeed, one important thing that we need to balance when we consider how and if the UK\u2019s approach to countering terror and extremism should change is whether any alterations would damage our efforts against these much larger threats. (That, and other topics, is the subject of a must-read piece by the UK\u2019s independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall, which you can read here.)\n\nBut in terms of the specifics of this case, no. Actually \u201cjust how hard should we make it for the rest of us to buy knives?\u201d is a relevant policy debate. \u201cWhat does the UK do well and badly in terms of integrating people into the country?\u201d isn\u2019t. Badenoch was pressed on the topic by the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg yesterday and she gave the following answer (emphasis mine):\n\nI am really not sure where Badenoch has got this idea from: Rudakubana had materials about genocides and atrocities, yes. The more than 164,000 pieces of material he had ranged from Gaza, to Grozny, to Iraq, to the genocide in Rwanda and the Holocaust. I suppose some of that could be categorised as \u201cwhite genocide\u201d but Badenoch seems to have unearthed a motive and a consistency to Rudakubana\u2019s interests that neither the Crown Prosecution Service nor the police have. (Over on Bluesky, Sunder Katwala offers a plausible theory as to the source of Badenoch\u2019s belief.)\n\nWhen pressed by Kuenssberg on where she had the evidence for her claims about integration, Badenoch responded:\n\nBut Badenoch\u2019s background is not similar to Rudakubana. She was born in the UK (in an era when being born in the UK still gave you an automatic right to citizenship) but she spent the first 16 years of her life in Nigeria. Rudakubana was born in the UK and grew up in the UK. These backgrounds are about as far apart as well, the 2,000 or so miles separating Nigeria from Rwanda.\n\nThis is part of what looks to be a pattern: that Badenoch does not familiarise herself with the particulars of a policy row or a subject but defaults to what her prior convictions tell her, regardless of whether they fit the facts or not.\n\nI think that her failure to do the reading also explains this Guardian scoop. In 2015, when Badenoch was a member of the Greater London Authority, she was one of the co-authors of a report that criticised Prevent, suggesting that the programme could alienate communities. Such terms are near-identical to the ones she now castigates Keir Starmer and Yvette Cooper for signing up to. (She said on X last week: \u201cWhen the Conservatives were trying to toughen the Prevent anti-extremism programme, [Keir] Starmer and [Yvette] Cooper were running for office on manifestos worried about Prevent \u2018alienating communities\u2019.\u201d)\n\nI don\u2019t think that her failure to write a dissenting opinion, as one other member of that GLA committee did, is because her \u201ctrue\u201d opinions are closer to Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto than she lets on. I think it\u2019s because in 2015 she didn\u2019t do the reading, just as she has yet to demonstrate a grip on a topic at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. This is obviously a problem because our system works best when the leader of the opposition is across the detail of what the government is doing.\n\nBut it is particularly important on this topic, because the specifics of this case are so unlike most of the threats the UK faces. When the government proposes some potentially far-reaching changes to our response to terrorism works, the leader of the opposition really needs to be across the facts of this specific set of crimes to do her job properly.\n\nFor reasons I don\u2019t fully understand, when I try and read a grown-up novel in January and February, my brain revolts: I read slowly, fitfully and there is no pleasure in it. I used to fight against this but the only consequence was to prolong the problem. So in the first two months of the year, I either read non-fiction or children\u2019s literature.

The challenges we face are well understood. Rising employer costs, including the increase in national insurance contributions, are squeezing margins. Post-Brexit customs arrangements continue to create complexity for companies trading with the EU.\n\nThe British Chambers of Commerce quarterly economic survey \u2014 the largest poll of business sentiment since October\u2019s Budget \u2014 found confidence at its lowest level since autumn 2022. Companies need ministers to provide a clear pathway to sustainable economic growth and one of the keys to this is investment in infrastructure. The evidence is clear: well-planned infrastructure projects not only create jobs, they also generate lasting economic benefits that hugely benefit regions and often the whole country.\n\nConsider Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). This potentially transformative project \u2014 a modern railway between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and more \u2014 exemplifies the multiplying potential of infrastructure investment. The link will do more than simply connect these cities: it will serve as a powerful economic catalyst, injecting \u00a3118bn into the northern economy by 2050. Through increased capacity and reduced journey times, it will forge stronger business connections and expand labour markets, creating opportunities for millions.\n\nBut the benefits stretch further. NPR and other projects like it are a massive stimulus through the supply chains of any local economy. They support the obvious industries \u2014 construction, manufacturing and logistics \u2014 as well as retail, hospitality for visiting workers and tech support.\n\nThe returns on such investments are compelling. Take the Ely and Haughley junction improvements, which promise to deliver nearly \u00a35 in economic benefits for every \u00a31 invested \u2014 a return that would impress any business leader.\n\nIn aviation, Gatwick\u2019s Northern Runway Project demonstrates how private investment can drive public benefit, with \u00a32.2bn of private capital creating 14,000 new jobs and contributing \u00a31bn annually to the local economy. The recent announcement by the chancellor of support for this project \u2014 alongside expansion at Luton and a third runway at Heathrow \u2014 are big promises and show a government unafraid to take difficult decisions to deliver growth.\n\nWe applaud this and welcome planned limits on spurious\u00a0lawfare that allows vested interests to seemingly delay every proposal. Judicial review is too often a tool for the few to stand in the way of the interests of the many.\n\nBut the battle is far from won. The government must now deliver on its promises. Because it isn\u2019t just transport projects affected right now. Every day wasted is another solar farm pushed back and another high-voltage undersea cable becoming that much more expensive.\n\nEnergy infrastructure is crucial to our economic future. The Sizewell C nuclear reactor represents more than just power generation. It embodies economic regeneration and a vote of confidence in the UK, 25,000 construction jobs and opportunities across the supply chain.\n\nEconomic growth and meeting net zero targets are not a zero-sum game. Strategic investment in energy infrastructure has the unique potential to benefit the entire country, while helping to meet our climate goals. In the long term, we will benefit from cheaper, more secure supplies \u2014 but only if we build capacity now.\n\nOur international competitors are not standing still. To avoid being left behind, the UK needs streamlined planning processes and stable policy frameworks to encourage private investment.

Failure to do so would be \u201ca disincentive to investors\u201d and harm the sector\u2019s competitiveness, it said. The thresholds are set by asset size and number of active accounts. Financiers estimate that at least five fast-growing banks, such as Revolut, are likely to soon be caught by the requirement to issue the loss-absorbing debt.\n\nUnder rules introduced after the 2008 financial crisis, banks above a certain size need an extra layer of debt that regulators can wipe out or convert to equity in a crisis, known as MREL \u2014 minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities. This is designed to avoid governments ever needing to use taxpayer funds to rescue failed lenders.\n\nThe rules came under fresh scrutiny after the BoE intervened to transfer the UK subsidiary of failed US lender Silicon Valley Bank to HSBC over a weekend in 2023.\n\nIn response, the government introduced new legislation allowing the BoE to use funds from the sector\u2019s deposit insurance scheme to finance the transfer of a failed bank to a rival.\n\nThe BoE said in October it planned to introduce a \u201ccontractual trigger\u201d into loss-absorbing debt that allowed officials to wipe it out if the foreign parent of a British bank is put into resolution, even if the UK subsidiary remains operationally viable.\n\nUK Finance said regulators in other jurisdictions \u201chave not taken such an expansive approach to the use of contractual triggers\u201d and warned the plans would create \u201csignificant challenges\u201d for lenders.\n\nThe sector fears that it would be costly to rewrite the terms of billions pounds worth of loss-absorbing debt to give the BoE this extra power, while warning it could change the accounting treatment of the securities. UK Finance said the central bank should at least exclude existing debt.\n\nIn October, the BoE said it planned to raise the size threshold above which banks need to raise such debt from total assets of \u00a315bn-\u00a325bn to \u00a320bn-\u00a330bn. It also said banks caught by a separate threshold based on the number of active accounts would no longer have to raise this loss-absorbing debt.\n\nUK Finance called for the central bank to go further by increasing the size threshold to \u00a340bn-\u00a350bn to take account of inflation since the rule was introduced in 2015. It also called for the active account threshold to be scrapped or raised from 40,000-80,000 to 100,000-150,000.\n\nRevolut, which was granted a UK banking licence last year, increased its total assets from \u00a314.1bn in 2022 to \u00a317.4bn in 2023.

After rising sharply in the first two weeks \u2014 by roughly 0.3 percentage points for five-year gilts \u2014 they have now returned to where they started. While there is noise around fiscal policy, the moves have largely been driven by global factors. US bond yields have exhibited similar volatility.\n\nBond markets in the UK may be more sensitive to fiscal credibility following the turbulence after the 2022 Liz Truss budget. But fiscal sustainability in the UK does not significantly differ from some peers, including France, which has a higher fiscal deficit and more rapidly rising debt.\n\nThe UK remains an outlier, however, on the other side of the policy ledger. The Bank of England\u2019s policy rate of 4.75 per cent is now the highest among large developed countries. That is weighing on activity. Economic growth has stagnated since the summer, and labour demand has fallen sharply. Inflation has eased in the past year and is now in the \u201ctwo-point-something\u201d range, close to the BoE\u2019s target of 2 per cent. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that at its December meeting the BoE repeated its intention to lower its policy rate ahead.\n\nBut how low will it go? Unlike many other central banks, the BoE has not provided clear guidance. Estimating the equilibrium rate, where monetary policy is neither tight or loose, requires a great deal of humility. It depends on factors affecting the supply and demand for capital, which naturally change over time.\n\nA simple way to estimate it is by looking at economic growth. High-growth countries attract more investment and encourage less saving, pushing rates higher. By this measure, the market\u2019s expected long-term interest rate in the UK seems high. Productivity has only increased by 0.5 per cent (annualised) since the pandemic began, slightly below its pre-pandemic rate and less than a third of that in the US \u2014 and actual productivity may be even lower owing to ongoing issues with the labour force survey data, which probably under-reports employment levels.\n\nInflation puts upward pressure on interest rates, too. Although core inflation in the UK \u2014 at 3.2 per cent over the past year \u2014 remains slightly higher than in most other developed countries, it\u2019s trending down. Underlying price pressures, excluding one-time tax shocks, are easing, especially in services. Based on medium-term inflation expectations, the central bank\u2019s credibility is intact and we see few reasons why the UK will have structurally higher inflation than in other countries.\n\nYet markets remain sceptical, expecting only a few cuts ahead to a final destination of around 4 per cent. This outlook may reflect concerns that increased government spending could lead to higher inflation. Markets might also question the government\u2019s commitment to its new fiscal rules, given its recent history of adjustments. Like Italy, but unlike most other large, developed countries, the UK borrows money at a much higher interest rate than its underlying economic growth rate, worsening debt dynamics.\n\nWe have a more benign central view for inflation, even if we acknowledge that fiscal policy adds uncertainty. Despite increased government spending, taxes will rise too, leaving fiscal policy tight. The net effect will probably drag on activity and employment, as already evident in recent surveys. Firms may pass some of the National Insurance hike on to consumers, but that would be a price level adjustment \u2014 like a value added tax or tariff hike. Typically, that is something central banks look through. And we would be very surprised if the government did not adjust taxation or spending to meet its fiscal rules, given the bond market\u2019s recent volatility.\n\nAs such, we expect UK gilt yields to decline. The five-year gilt yield is now only a fraction lower than that in the US and we expect it to fall below the US level over time, similar to the five years before the pandemic. While the risks of rates going higher remain \u2014 near-term inflation expectations have edged higher in recent months \u2014 there are more reasons to expect rates to fall, given increased global trade uncertainty, tight fiscal policy and a generally soft growth outlook.\n\nAs for the policy rate, our internal models point to a neutral interest rate of 2 to 3 per cent in the UK. Even if the BoE is cautious with rate cuts in the first half of this year, we see room for the rate to fall by more than the market expects. The BoE might eventually follow other central banks, including the European Central Bank, Bank of Canada, Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Riksbank in pivoting to faster cuts.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/11492c24-7af8-4e70-b0ee-fd3af93ac68e"}}, {"id": "01c94e2b-9303-4f17-8ec9-7247aba20a4d", "event_name": "Does lower inflation make bonds an appealing option for portfolios?", "blurb": "Gilts can offer an attractive income that is regular, predictable and contractual", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "The early weeks of 2025 have been awash with news headlines about a bond market sell-off. However, investment platform AJ Bell points out that there are always two sides to every market story \u2014 and the rise in yields as bond prices fall means retail investors\u2019 appetite for UK government bonds is picking up.\n\nIn January, the UK Treasury sold \u00a34.25bn-worth of five-year gilts at an average yield of 4.49 per cent, with \u00a312.74bn-worth of bids received. AJ Bell customers were among those fuelling this strong demand in the auction.\n\nAnd they were not alone. At the end of last year, many analysts were pointing out that the time had come to invest in bonds. The recovery from 2022, the worst year for bonds, has been robust. \u201cSome high yield managers have been doing as well as global equities over the past two years,\u201d points out Tideway Wealth\u2019s investment director Nick Gait.\n\nBonds can offer an attractive income that is regular, predictable and contractual. But they are also good portfolio diversifiers, able to offset poor performance when equity markets decline in value \u2014 and some wealth managers already believe the bull market in equities is looking a bit long in the tooth.\n\nTideway Wealth even has some clients whose self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) are 100 per cent invested in fixed income. The rationale is that, while the US-led bull market in equities may continue, the downside risks are increasing. Bonds with real yields may be a good alternative for older investors \u2014 or those in pension drawdown.\n\n\u201cThe higher government bond yields go, the greater the competition against equities for investors\u2019 money,\u201d says Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. \u201cAt some point, investors will take the view that they can get a decent yield from bonds for lower risk compared with investing in stocks.\u201d\n\nAnother factor that has made fixed income look more attractive is a slowdown in inflation after years of rapidly rising consumer prices.\n\n\u201cInflation moving from a high rate to a low or normal rate is not something we have experienced in a generation, so investors have forgotten just how attractive this environment can be for fixed income,\u201d notes April LaRusse, head of investment specialists at Insight Investment.\n\nMateusz Malek, head of bond research at Killik & Co adds: \u201cAlthough we have recently entered the period when inflation is expected to reaccelerate slightly, overall, it is forecast to remain contained and below the level of yields offered by bonds.\u201d Interest rate cuts could also boost bond returns.\n\nHowever, Thomas Becket, co-chief investment officer of Canaccord Genuity Wealth, thinks gilts have been selling off partly because of a repricing of UK interest rate expectations.\n\nThis wobble in the market also serves as a reminder that bonds are not risk free. \u201cInvestors are worried about extra borrowing by the UK government to achieve its plans, and the uncertain outlook for the economy given widespread pessimism by businesses and consumers,\u201d says Coatsworth.\n\nHowever, some view the recent yield movements as largely an overreaction to global political uncertainty.\n\n\u201cWe believe gilt yields will fall over 2025/26, as the Bank of England unwinds their current restrictive stance, and will eventually reach a level consistent with the fundamentals of the UK economy,\u201d says Matt Tickle chief investment officer at Barnett Waddingham.\n\nIn the UK, private investors can access gilts and T-bills, but investing in corporate bonds is heavily regulated and limited only to professionals. Some wealth managers, such as Killik, will build portfolios of corporate bonds for their clients. Others, like Tideway, use professionally managed bond funds, such as Royal London UK Government Bond, or, for investment-grade credit, the Man Group Sterling Corporate Bond. \u201cWe have spoken to our bond fund managers in the wake of recent movements and they are optimistic of high single-digit returns again in 2025,\u201d says Tideway\u2019s Gait.\n\nEven so, investors should always be aware of the two core risks: duration (the measure of interest rate risk the portfolio aims to take) and credit quality (how much risk you\u2019re willing to take to achieve returns).\n\n\u201cHaving any certainty over the longer end of the yield curve is perilously hard,\u201d Becket says. \u201cThere is no clarity on the outlook for any of interest rates, inflation and government policy improving.\u201d\n\nGait adds: \u201cThe greater than 5 per cent return now available on long duration gilts is clearly attracting retail investors, particularly on low coupon bonds where gains will be tax free. But many, I suspect, will underestimate the risks when you buy longer duration.\u201d\n\nThe most popular gilts with retail investors using the Interactive Investor platform at the end of 2024 included T26 and TN28, maturing at the end of January 2026 and January 2028. Because these gilts have coupons of 0.125 per cent and trade below their par value, most of the return comes from the \u00a3100 redemption value of each gilt on maturity, which is capital gains tax free \u2014 making them popular with investors holding them outside of tax-advantaged individual savings accounts, or SIPPs.\n\n\u201cGilt prices move when market conditions change, but gilts maturing soon are less volatile than longer-dated gilts,\u201d says Sam Benstead, fixed income lead at Interactive Investor. \u201cIf you want a near-guaranteed return, then direct gilts are a good option, particularly bonds maturing soon.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/515ed6b0-e45d-4c64-b109-f6869525e719"}}, {"id": "ac661761-c62b-4f76-bf19-2c3884269a7b", "event_name": "Move fast on planning to restore \u2018animal spirits\u2019, US investor tells Keir Starmer", "blurb": "UK\u2019s record of slow growth can be turned around, says Birmingham City FC owner ", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "The US owner of Birmingham City football club has said the UK can unlock a wave of inbound investment \u201cincredibly quickly\u201d if the government makes tangible progress on its pledge to speed up planning approvals.\n\nTom Wagner, co-founder of Knighthead Capital, told the Financial Times that Britain\u2019s record of under-investment and slow growth could be turned around if Labour made good on its vow to remove obstacles to development.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of projects that we are looking at in the UK that we\u2019d love to pursue if the process can be made easier,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not the only ones. If things change by just a small amount, there\u2019ll be a lot of capital inflow and a lot of excess growth.\u201d\n\nKnighthead has acquired more than 60 acres of land around Birmingham City\u2019s stadium since taking control of the third-tier team in 2023. The New York-based hedge fund plans to build a new 60,000-seat venue as part of a large \u00a33bn regeneration project involving housing, retail and entertainment space in one of the UK\u2019s poorest neighbourhoods.\n\nThe firm manages about $9bn and has yet to submit formal planning applications for the project, which hinges on local authorities agreeing to set up new transport links. A proposed extension of Birmingham\u2019s tram network through the area has been repeatedly delayed over several years.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has sought in recent weeks to prop up business confidence in the sluggish UK economy, as increased public borrowing and sterling weakness prompted warnings from billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio that the country was heading towards a \u201cdebt death spiral\u201d.\n\nWhile Starmer wooed business before taking power in July, promising to \u201cbulldoze through barriers to British success\u201d, including with an overhaul of planning rules, relations were damaged by a \u00a340bn tax-raising Budget that weighed heavily on companies.\n\nWagner said he was still \u201cvery bullish\u201d about the UK\u2019s long-term prospects, saying the country had a \u201chighly educated, diverse, dynamic economy\u201d and the \u201csingle most exciting city in the world\u201d with the capital London.

You\u2019ll see that turn. Once you start seeing some positive momentum, that leads to more positive momentum.\u201d\n\nWith Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House expected to usher in a period of heightened economic competition and increase the gravitational pull of the US, Wagner said the onus was on governments around the world to make decisions that lowered barriers to investment.\n\n\u201cCapital is highly mobile, it will find the path of least resistance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen governments begin making things harder, vis-\u00e0-vis other jurisdictions into which that capital may flow, they will suffer.\u201d\n\nIn the UK, Wagner said planning remained the biggest obstacle to investment. \u201cThe solutions aren\u2019t that hard to get right. And when I see relatively easy solutions that are in the way of progress and capital investment, I tend to think that the right path will be found,\u201d he said.\n\nLabour has led an overhaul of England\u2019s national planning policy and proposed to limit the influence of local committees, as well as curtail attempts to block development through the courts. But experts have warned the changes could take years to take full effect.\n\nWagner, a former Goldman Sachs distressed debt trader, said Birmingham city council\u2019s financial woes \u2014 it was declared bankrupt last year and forced to make drastic cuts to spending \u2014 had \u201cvery little\u201d impact on Knighthead\u2019s plans so far, and the firm was continuing to buy up land in an area just over a mile away from the city centre.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hearing all the right things in our conversations. What we need to see now is a bit more action,\u201d he said, adding that he wanted to see real progress this calendar year on the potential extension of the city\u2019s Metro tramline to the site of the proposed new stadium. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that they\u2019ll do what needs to be done. If they can\u2019t for this project, well then maybe I\u2019d be more pessimistic on the UK economy more broadly.\u201d\n\nKnighthead\u2019s plans also rely on something even harder to predict: sporting success. Birmingham City were relegated to League One in their first season under US ownership, but are now top of the table of English football\u2019s third tier.\n\nThe team are still getting average attendances at home games of more than 26,000, higher than several Premier League sides, while former NFL star Tom Brady is now an adviser and shareholder at the club.\n\nWagner said the goal was to take Birmingham City back to the Premier League and stay there for a \u201clong period of time\u201d, and in the process rekindle the fierce local rivalry with Aston Villa. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly ambitious and probably a bit cocky thing to say, but, why bother if that\u2019s not the objective?\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/26edcee4-55e5-46b9-ac22-49d47b653399"}}, {"id": "57348e9e-02a6-4475-ad70-136c3c3faaae", "event_name": "Serco workers plan to strike over UK navy contract negotiations", "blurb": "Prospect union says proposed changes to existing \u00a31.2bn deal threaten Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "Workers at military contractor Serco are set to strike over a deal being negotiated by the company and the UK\u2019s Royal Navy, which they say could cut \u201cessential\u201d support for Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent.\n\nTrade union Prospect said up to a quarter of Serco\u2019s UK marine workforce will walk out for a day next month.\n\nThe union wants the company to pause discussions on a 10-year contract to replace Serco\u2019s existing \u00a31.2bn deal with the navy that is expiring this year.\n\nUnion representatives told the Financial Times they were concerned that the new contract could lead to cuts at Serco\u2019s marine business, which employs about 600 people.Under the current contract, Serco operates 91 vessels that provide services such as transporting personnel and moving larger ships to and from land, including the UK\u2019s nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers.\n\nProspect said it was told in a meeting with officials last year that savings of \u00a3250mn were being targeted over the duration of the new contract and up to 96 fewer Serco employees would be required.\n\n\u201cThe services covered by this contract are essential for national security and for the continuous at-sea deterrent,\u201d said Sue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary at Prospect. \u201cPausing now and reconsidering will avoid a costly and dangerous mistake.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s \u201ccontinuous at-sea deterrent\u201d involves a rotating fleet of nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarines, with at least one submarine at sea at any given time.\n\nThe government has said this provides \u201ca credible and effective response option to extreme aggression\u201d.\n\nBut Prospect, which has more than 150 members in Serco\u2019s marine business, said it was concerned the company would struggle to provide a continuous service towing submarines and other navy vessels if the cuts went ahead.The union also warned that it would be difficult to get more staff at a later stage if the navy realised it did not have enough people because it can take years to train replacements.\n\nIt said 87 per cent of members who participated in a ballot voted to strike.\u201cIf it continues as planned [this] will mean the loss of vital jobs which it will not be then possible to replace when the navy inevitably realises that it has made a mistake,\u201d Ferns said.The navy services provided by Serco were privatised through a 15-year contract worth \u00a31bn from 2007, with the company getting a 27-month extension worth \u00a3200mn in December 2022.\n\nNegotiations for the new contract are being finalised as the new Labour government is enforcing spending controls to ease pressure on its finances.

Nor can Hudson hold down wages, since a minimum-wage increase of 6.7 per cent will apply to many of her staff.\n\nSo she is cutting jobs: closing a caf\u00e9 in London, making a long-standing manager redundant and asking part-timers to work longer hours or leave, since they will no longer fall below the threshold for employer national insurance contributions. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we want to do,\u201d Hudson said.\n\nBusinesses across the UK are making similarly uncomfortable choices as they calculate how best to respond to the tax and wage increases announced by Rachel Reeves in the October Budget.\n\nThe policies \u2014 which the chancellor said would help restore \u201cstability to the public finances\u201d and pay for public services \u2014 will sharply increase labour costs, particularly in low-wage sectors such as retail and hospitality.\n\nThe question the Bank of England must answer is whether a weaker jobs market will finally bring down wage growth \u2014 or whether stubborn pay pressures will persist, keeping inflation above the official 2 per cent target.\n\nThere is mounting evidence that employers have cut headcount in the wake of the Budget announcements, with official data showing payroll employment fell in November and December as vacancies kept sliding.\n\nSurvey data published on Friday suggested the share of businesses cutting staffing levels was higher in January than at any point since the 2008-09 financial crisis, except the pandemic period.\n\nLiz Martins, economist at HSBC, said the combination of a weaker economy, higher costs and new scope for artificial intelligence-related efficiencies felt \u201clike a perfect storm\u201d for the jobs market.\n\nLast week, retailer J Sainsbury said it was axing 3,000 jobs, from its head office to its in-store caf\u00e9s, while an executive at Associated British Foods, owner of the low-cost fashion chain Primark, said people were starting to buy fewer clothes because of worries about job security.\n\nBut despite such retrenchment, wage growth has accelerated. Data last week showed private sector earnings grew at an annual pace of 6 per cent in the three months to November, excluding bonuses \u2014 double the 3 per cent pace the BoE thinks broadly consistent with the inflation target.\n\nOne contributing factor, highlighted in a recent trading statement by retailer Next, is that increases in the minimum wage have a lasting \u201cripple\u201d effect on pay higher up the scale, as employers seek to maintain incentives for promotion to higher grades.\n\nAndrew Wishart, economist at Berenberg bank, described this situation as a \u201cmassive headache\u201d for the BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, which is expected to cut interest rates from 4.75 per cent to 4.5 per cent when it next meets on February 6.\n\nHe said the minimum wage was \u201cbecoming a serious problem\u201d because it prevented low-wage employers absorbing the \u00a325bn NICs increase by holding down pay.\n\nYet even as they shed jobs, other businesses would still be able to pass on higher costs to consumers, keeping services price inflation above 4 per cent and pushing headline inflation above 3 per cent later this year.\n\nThe BoE, which watches services inflation closely, was still likely to lower interest rates in the short term in order to prevent a \u201chorrible\u201d outcome for workers, but it might need to stop cutting the cost of borrowing in the second half of the year, Wishart said.\n\nOther economists believe wage growth will slow over the course of the year, as companies will no longer fight to recruit higher-paid professionals who cannot wring a salary rise out of their current employer.\n\nMartins of HSBC said that trend was \u201cin the past now\u201d. While April\u2019s changes might lead some companies to raise prices initially, she argued that all the other ways they might respond \u2014 replacing workers with AI, squeezing pay, cutting jobs or offshoring work \u2014 would eventually lower inflation.\n\nBut wage growth may not subside fast enough for the BoE\u2019s comfort.\n\nFour-fifths of employers planned to make lower pay awards this year than in 2024, according to a poll conducted by analysts at Incomes Data Research and published on Monday. Most said the increase in NICs would make them less generous than they otherwise would have been.\n\nBut the survey found that more than half of employers who had not yet decided their award expected it to exceed 3 per cent. Where pay deals had been agreed, more than 40 per cent of employees were receiving 4 per cent or more.\n\n\u201cAll business surveys illustrate the same conundrum for the MPC.

A review into pensions adequacy, which the government had hoped would drive more investment into the UK, has been delayed indefinitely.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times in November, former pensions minister Emma Reynolds said she had prioritised reforming DC workplace schemes because that was \u201cwhere the growth is\u201d.\n\nShe pointed out the majority of corporate DB pension schemes were closed to new members and \u201cnaturally had a less long time frame\u201d as schemes move into less risky assets as they wind down or sell their pension obligations to an insurance company.\n\nHowever, industry insiders said a radical improvement in the funding position of DB pension schemes in recent years following a rise in government bond yields meant many were now in a position to take on more risk, if the rules enabled companies and scheme members to benefit from it.\n\n\u201cThe reason the government announcements have been about DC and the Local Government Pension Scheme is because they\u2019ve not really understood DB and think it\u2019s too big to touch\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but the implications of not touching it are worse for the government and I think they realise it now,\u201d said the chair of a multibillion pound DB pension scheme.\n\nDavid Lane, chief executive officer at TPT Retirement Solutions, which manages DB and DC pensions, said allowing companies to access scheme surpluses was \u201clikely to be a more effective way of channelling pension assets in to the UK economy than some of the consolidation initiatives that have been announced\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it\u2019s direct if the employer reinvests that money into its business\u201d.\n\nAccess to scheme surpluses could slow the pace at which pension funds have been offloading their pension obligations to insurance companies, with around \u00a350bn of assets transferred in so-called bulk annuity transactions in each of the past two years, according to pensions consultancy WTW.\n\nHalting this trend could help support UK government bond and equity markets in the longer term because insurance companies typically sell gilts and invest in higher-yielding corporate bonds \u2014 many of which are overseas \u2014 as well as infrastructure to make their profits.\n\nZoe Alexander, director of the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association trade group, said she backed surplus release, with the right protections in place to ensure member benefits are secure.\n\n\u201cLowering the legislative threshold for allowing returns of surplus could potentially encourage trustees (in conjunction with their employers) to adopt a more ambitious mindset and take on slightly riskier investment strategies for their DB assets, including greater investment in UK assets,\u201d she said.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/83edcc72-2d6f-4cef-8364-86c5d0c1f15a"}}, {"id": "6d4d869a-0e19-4ad0-a3eb-c02eb9279ffd", "event_name": "How Britain can seize the next decade", "blurb": "Marginal gains in the country\u2019s strengths and weaknesses would go a long way", "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0", "body": "Welcome readers. I\u2019m backpacking in Vietnam and Laos this week, so I\u2019ve prepared something slightly different.\n\nAs readers know, the aim of Free Lunch on Sunday is to present analysis that counters conventional wisdom. For each piece, this often involves discussing positions with economists and market strategists that are not necessarily their house view.\n\nSo for this edition, rather than the usual synthesis of my findings, I wanted to share more of what the analysts told me. I asked experts to sketch out a bullish scenario for the British economy over the next decade, and what it would take to get there. Here\u2019s what they said.\n\nFirst, the global backdrop. Labour\u2019s large parliamentary majority means the UK now stands out for its (relative) stability. France has an unstable coalition and Germany faces an election in February. Political views in the EU are splintering. In the US, President Donald Trump appears more interested in fomenting uncertainty.\n\nAs for trade disruption, Britain\u2019s specialism in services \u2014 and position outside the EU \u2014 puts it less in the line of fire of Trump\u2019s tariff plans. The US president is more focused on the trade in goods, particularly with China and the European trading bloc.\n\nLabour has already eaten into this \u201cstability dividend\u201d by lumbering companies with high taxes in its autumn Budget. Still, Marko Papic, chief strategist at BCA Research, reckons that the autonomy Britain has from being less restrained by internal politics and trade wars could be a boon:\n\nBuilding on this advantage would require a targeted approach to striking agreements. Deals on the trade in services could allow Britain to export its comparative advantage in high-value services further and wider. And reducing the red tape involved in trading with the EU, the UK\u2019s largest trading partner, would boost supply chains.\n\nLess Trump exposure is also why some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest institutions are betting that UK equities will outpace the rest of Europe\u2019s this year. They believe banks and energy companies \u2014 which have large weightings on the London Stock Exchange \u2014 could experience a boost from Trump\u2019s deregulation and pro-oil policies. Low valuations also look attractive.\n\nBut British stocks will still need a catalyst to drive equity values up. I asked Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, where it may come from:\n\nIndeed, Britain ranks third in Capital Economics\u2019 index of advanced economies best-placed to benefit from AI adoption, given its large services sector and flexible labour market.\n\nEfforts to unshackle Britain\u2019s vast pension capital \u2014 the largest in Europe \u2014 could support more investment in public and private equities, both at home and abroad. But Gimber suggests there are better levers to pull:\n\nA few studies suggest slashing stamp duty on shares could raise revenues in the long term by boosting growth.\n\nAnd with tight public finances, \u201cremoving hurdles\u201d is where Sam Dumitriu, head of policy at Britain Remade, thinks the UK can get the biggest bang for its buck.\n\nLabour\u2019s Planning and Infrastructure Bill is expected in the coming months. If it can streamline regulations, speed up approvals and clear more land for development, investment could jump.\n\nThe government\u2019s industrial strategy, due to be published this spring, is set to unveil opportunities to crowd-in private investment into key infrastructure projects. It is also supposed to outline plans to boost Britain\u2019s existing strengths in high-demand growth sectors. These include financial and professional services, university research and education, renewables (wind, carbon capture and storage), life sciences, aerospace technology, artificial intelligence and creative industries. (Less red tape, wider investment incentives and improved access to training and high-skilled talent would all help.)\n\nThat Britain does these complex things pretty well, but struggles with simpler tasks, is a reason to be optimistic, adds Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt.\n\nIndeed, until the past couple of years, Britain struggled with political stability. Now that it has some, investment has returned. Add a few bespoke trade deals, a plan to strengthen its comparative advantages and planning reforms \u2014 and things can only get better.\n\nDumitriu added: \u201cIf we stay good at what we\u2019re good at and get less bad at what we\u2019re very bad at, then the next decade could be a very good one for Britain.\u201d\n\nThoughts?

But Shah said the changes would \u201chave no impact on the direction of IHT\u201d.\n\nWealth managers said that many more of their clients faced the prospect of their estates falling within the scope of IHT over the next decade, with some attributing the increase in gifting to the changes to HMRC\u2019s treatment of pensions and agricultural land.\n\nUnused pension pots will be included in estates from April 2027 and subject to the standard 40 per cent IHT rate. Meanwhile, landowners will from April 2026 be subject to a 20 per cent levy on agricultural land above a threshold of between \u00a31.3mn and \u00a33mn, depending on whether they are married and if they own a home.\n\nEmma Sterland, chief financial planning director at Evelyn Partners, said the reforms to pensions and land taxation were behind a rise in \u201cclients thinking about making financial gifts to their families\u201d, with the Budget evidence that IHT was \u201cin the Treasury\u2019s crosshairs\u201d.\n\nIan Cook, a chartered financial planner at Quilter Cheviot, said he was encouraging clients to \u201cconsider gifting more strategically\u201d in view of the upcoming pensions taxation reforms after more had begun \u201cexploring ways to pass on wealth during their lifetime\u201d.\n\nThe Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c68787da-5b0e-4544-9654-b4dd7924c450"}}, {"id": "88653df3-e430-410d-8a34-99fb1fdd851c", "event_name": "Harland & Wolff takeover raises fears over payments to suppliers", "blurb": "Bankrupt shipbuilder is being bought by Spanish state-owned group Navantia", "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0", "body": "Harland & Wolf suppliers owed millions of pounds fear they will not be paid as the bankrupt shipbuilder is taken over by Spain\u2019s Navantia, warning of a hit to UK supply chains if they are replaced by European contractors.\n\nThe 164-year-old company best known for building the Titanic fell into administration last September, hobbled by large losses and steep interest payments on its debt.\n\nA deal was struck in December with state-owned Navantia which the UK government vowed would protect 1,000 jobs at H & W\u2019s four yards in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland.\n\nBut suppliers say jobs are already being lost in the supply chain and they have little prospect of getting their invoices paid.\n\nRussell Downs, the bankruptcy and restructuring expert brought in as interim executive chair in July, told the Financial Times in December the sale to Navantia \u201cregrettably\u201d would mean losses for creditors and suppliers.\n\nOn January 14, the four yards that had been continuing to operate followed the parent company into administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very stressful,\u201d said the chief executive of one British-based supplier who, like others, asked not to be named. \u201cThey owe us \u00a310mn plus, a reasonably big chunk of our business\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009We\u2019re an SME.

Navantia had pushed for a boost to clinch the deal.\n\nA government spokesperson said it \u201chas not given any direct financial support to Navantia\u201d and the deal contained \u201cthe minimum changes to the contract necessary \u2014 on commercial terms \u2014 to ensure its continued delivery\u201d.\n\nHilary Benn, the UK\u2019s Northern Ireland secretary, on January 15 blamed unpaid invoices to suppliers on \u201cthe failure of the old H & W\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt now falls to Navantia to decide which of the invoices it wishes to pay, but it will want to secure a relationship with suppliers contributing to the fleet solid support ship programme,\u201d he said.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d11a64f5-70d4-4bb6-add7-a986745fb743"}}, {"id": "19c7aead-20c1-4723-94bf-3811c731018e", "event_name": "Insurers in court battle with UK businesses over Covid furlough scheme", "blurb": "Judges to decide if insurance groups can deduct government funds from payouts for business interruption", "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0", "body": "Three of England\u2019s most senior judges are set to hear a legal challenge brought by businesses that were forced to close during the pandemic over whether insurance companies can deduct furlough funds from payouts under business interruption policies.\n\nLawyers said hundreds of millions of pounds were at stake in the precedent-setting case, which is the latest front in a broader legal battle over insurance coverage for businesses during the pandemic.\n\nThe Court of Appeal is due this week to hear the dispute about whether insurers are right to deduct government furlough funds \u2014 subsidies paid to businesses during lockdowns to cover wages and prevent mass redundancies \u2014 when they calculate the insurance payouts.\n\nInsurers Liberty Mutual, Allianz and Aviva have argued that they are entitled to subtract the furlough payments. But businesses bringing the legal challenge, which include Starboard Hotels and Arena Racing, owner of racecourses such as Chepstow and Bath, said the furlough funds were not designed to subsidise the insurance industry.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be the insurers that end up being the ultimate beneficiaries\u201d of furlough, said Aaron Le Marquer, partner at law firm Stewarts, which represents Arena Racing.\n\nThe UK government launched its furlough scheme at the height of the pandemic in 2020. It allowed for staff to be paid 80 per cent of their salary or wage up to a cap of \u00a32,500 a month.\n\nPayments were made to 1.3mn employers, costing the government about \u00a370bn.\n\nIn a judgment last year, the High Court found that insurers were permitted to take furlough payments into account when calculating insurance payouts.\n\nHowever, the judge, Mr Justice Jacobs, granted policyholders permission to appeal on the grounds that it was an \u201cimportant marketwide issue\u201d.\n\nThe case before the Court of Appeal is due to be heard on Tuesday and Wednesday by Lord Justice Popplewell, Lord Justice Phillips and Sir Julian Flaux, chancellor of the High Court.\n\nLawyers for the claimants said the furlough dispute arose in \u201cmany thousands\u201d of other business interruption claims beyond those of the claimants.\n\nIn a letter to the Association of British Insurers in 2020, the Treasury wrote that it expected \u201cthat grant funds intended to provide emergency support to businesses at this time of crisis are not to be deducted from business interruption insurance claims\u201d.\n\nLiberty Mutual, Allianz, Aviva and the UK government declined to comment.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/933137c3-9948-49b1-af8a-256045339cb0"}}, {"id": "5b34fb9c-8f1e-4c22-9d04-b5fb570ed370", "event_name": "Competition or growth?

But the cash-strapped, tax-raising government is still scratching around for ideas that can make a difference. Its abrupt replacement of the chair of the antitrust regulator last week gives the impression that a looser approach to competition enforcement is in its sights. It is not a good look.\n\nForcing out Marcus Bokkerink, the chair of the UK Competition and Markets Authority, might be intended to send a message about Britain\u2019s openness to investment. Complaints that it was closed for business were hurled around in 2023 when, unlike peers, the watchdog initially blocked Microsoft\u2019s takeover of the gaming developer Activision Blizzard.\n\nAfter a modified version of the deal was approved, Microsoft described the CMA as \u201ctough and fair\u201d. Even so, the government is doubtless anxious to hear fewer complaints from potential investors about the regulator. The return to power of a US president intent on defending American interests abroad is another salient factor. The EU is wondering whether to adjust or scale back its own tech probes.\n\nSir Keir Starmer\u2019s government may want to go no further than a symbolic change of leadership and rhetorical flourishes about \u201csupercharging\u201d the economy with pro-business decisions. If it does want to consider changes to competition policy it would not be alone. A new team of US trustbusters is expected to relax the tough approach to dealmaking imposed under Joe Biden, though a return to traditionally conservative antitrust policies is not guaranteed.\n\nIn Europe, former European Central Bank governor Mario Draghi argued that domestic champions should be allowed to bulk up to compete with Chinese and US giants in last year\u2019s blockbuster report on EU competitiveness. He favoured consolidation in the telecoms sector to give companies the muscle to invest, although sceptics say there is little evidence that telecoms mergers boost investment.\n\nThe CMA is well aware of the trade-offs. It noted that intense competition can be detrimental to innovation, in research published earlier this month. Last year it gave the green light to the Vodafone-Three UK joint venture, on condition it committed to certain infrastructure investments. It has also signalled a willingness to approve mergers on the basis of behavioural, rather than structural, remedies.\n\nOverall, it is hard to argue the CMA takes an overly aggressive approach. The number of mergers it investigates that are rejected or abandoned is small and falling. The UK has seen a modest weakening of competition, measured by cost mark-ups, over the past 25 years.\n\nMinisters should avoid giving the impression they want to influence competition decisions. Keeping powerful incumbents in check can help other businesses flourish. Antitrust enforcement is generally a spur, not an impediment, to growth and productivity gains. Moreover, competition policy should be stable and predictable. Political interference fuels uncertainty, and there is little that businesses hate more.\n\nvanessa.houlder@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nWorld of profitable exits and killer acquisitions / From Simon Holmes, Visiting Professor in Law, University of Oxford, Oxfordshire, UK", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d6cd798d-b9d6-474a-9153-0d13ecffe591"}}, {"id": "33c6784d-8168-43e9-a360-e5d8f534795a", "event_name": "John McAslan\u2019s house of two halves", "blurb": "Victorian meets modern at the architect\u2019s home in south-west London.

This unusual design is the initial welcome into the expansive, expressive interior that lies beyond the front door.\n\nThe hallway, with original geometric period tiling, features an oblique, narrow glass window that frames an olive tree planted in an external side return. On\u00a0the left, it bursts open into a living area, and straight\u00a0ahead segues into a big kitchen that swings out perpendicularly into a\u00a0dining area with a vast Vitra table.\u00a0A wall of sliding glass garden doors filters light across the\u00a0entire ground floor.\n\nScotsman McAslan, who founded John McAslan+ Partners in 1993, is a pioneer of intervention and preservation \u2013 an architectural approach that favours repurposing (rather than demolishing) old buildings. His multi-award-winning practice is behind some of the most impressive transport hubs in the world including King\u2019s Cross Station, Sydney Metro\u2019s Central Station, the upgrade of Penn Station in New York and Bond Street station on the \u00a0Elizabeth Line, alongside residential towers, education centres and museums such as the revamped The Burrell Collection in his home city of Glasgow. While different, each project is underpinned by human-centric architecture that improves the quality of urban life.\n\nWhen it came to conceiving this house, the McAslans were not interested in statement-making grandeur but in\u00a0creating a beautiful environment in which to live, love,\u00a0think and\u00a0work. For John, the methodology is the same. \u201cIt\u00a0was about transforming the old into new, which\u00a0is what a lot of the work of the practice is about. We\u00a0wanted\u00a0to open it up, retain what we could, set a budget\u00a0and develop a language of architecture and design\u00a0that was an expression of us,\u201d he says. \u201cThe central\u00a0idea\u00a0here was to get the energy of the house circulating front to back and retain, remodel and upcycle\u00a0what existed to varying degrees \u2013 we had an ecological, fabric-first approach.\u201d\n\nSince the early 1980s, the couple lived in four different properties in Notting Hill. As John was building his business, Dava was working in recruitment while raising three children, Hannah, Flossy and Renwick, who have now all left home. There was no\u00a0urgency to move, rather a gentle yearning for more light,\u00a0sky and a sense of expansiveness, which is hard to find\u00a0in\u00a0the densely occupied city.\n\nMoving south of the river was not on the agenda until their daughter Hannah, a lawyer who lives in the area, spotted the property and went for a recce, iPhone in hand. She sent the video to John and Dava who were on holiday at\u00a0their restored farm south of Florence. They swiftly put\u00a0in\u00a0an offer. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done that before. We\u2019re normally forensic,\u201d laughs Dava of the almost blind bid and\u00a0the serendipitous events that landed them the keys.\n\nThe core renovation with the construction company Davies & Daughters involved knocking down walls, opening up all the spaces, building out into the garden and ripping out a \u201ccircus tent\u201d conservatory. \u201cIt was an awful octagonal makeshift \u201970s one \u2013 boiling in the summer and leaky in the rain,\u201d says John, rolling his intense blue eyes. It was reconfigured into a punched-out\u00a0space that now frames a small kidney-shaped garden landscaped by Jack Newlyn and enclaved by bamboo and neighbouring trees.\n\nThe first floor hosts John and Dava\u2019s bedroom, a private sitting room and an emerald-Bisazza-tiled en suite bathroom with a curvilinear wall. The top floor houses two super-size flexible sleep-living spaces for guests and family, with extended eaves that create new volumes and\u00a0light. The upstairs bathrooms are vivid lime green \u201ccubes\u201d with a painted floor, ceiling and wall in the same wake-me-up hue. \u201cThe layout of the house is clear and direct, with flexibility: the ground floor is entirely open, engaging the hall, reception spaces, extended kitchen, garden room and fully opening into and through the garden,\u201d says John, who admits he has an aversion to rooms with closed doors. \u201cThe first floor is our apartment, and the top floor is a suite of connected spaces that can open or close as needs be.\u201d \u201cI feel I can use every room,\u201d says Dava. \u201cThere are times when I take my laptop and go all the way up to the top of the house and it\u2019s just great.\u201d\n\nThere were a few trouble spots, including a damp, rotting cellar that required gutting and fixing to make way for a utility area. \u201cHow we avoided electrocution, I don\u2019t know!\u201d says Dava of the early renovation. They moved in permanently in March 2024. Perhaps unusually, the couple were aligned on pretty much all aspects, including the wood-panelled walls and simple single strips of shelving (by John Cherrington of Windmill Furniture) that feature throughout. The Strong White (Farrow & Ball) wall paint changes with the light, accented by breezy voile curtains, citrus-green blinds (that beam optimism from the street view) and the wide oak floorboards.\n\nThe couple first met in the late 1970s in Boston at the canteen of the architectural practice Cambridge Seven Associates, where John had just landed an internship as a\u00a0recent graduate from Edinburgh University. Dava was working as an executive assistant to one of the partners. It was a coup de foudre. \u201cI\u00a0said to myself, well, I\u2019m going to marry her. This was she! So I stayed my year and I think on the last day I asked you out or something,\u201d smiles John, who returned to London to work at Richard Rogers and rack up a phone bill calling his sweetheart. A transatlantic courtship ensued before Dava moved to the UK in 1981 and they wed. \u201cNot really knowing each other, but enough to know,\u201d laughs Dava. \u201cThis was not anything I ever planned when I was burning my bra with my feminist sisters: a, to get married; or b, to marry someone I didn\u2019t know very well.\u201d\n\nThe couple share a love of adventure, travel, family and collecting that is writ large in their collection of furniture, art and artefacts. The cane and teak furniture is a combination of original armchairs designed by Pierre Jeanneret for Chandigarh in the 1950s, with a number of pieces recently made by Phillips Antiques in India in reclaimed teak. The wooden screens by Artek were designed by Alvar Aalto in 1936, and they own a standout Brazilian petal table by Jorge Zalszupin from the 1960s. \u201cWe dressed the interiors with an array of panelled wall assemblies \u2013 some open and some closed \u2013 for our library. The artefacts, collected over time and very personal to us, express our journey individually and as a family,\u201d says Dava.\n\nThere is a luminescent collection of Bakelite pieces (many found in Martha\u2019s Vineyard) perched on cabinets; a\u00a0vintage Missoni rug alongside colourful abstract floor coverings, some sketched by John and handwoven by Shyam Ahuja in Mumbai. The artworks, casually leaning on the narrow shelves and coursing up the stairwells, range from an exquisite sketch of two female bottoms by\u00a0their daughter Flossy (John swears it is better than Klimt) to contemporary Indian abstract painters, and a\u00a0very early American 1869 Shield, Eagle and Flags stamp\u00a0(one of a series purchased for their children) to\u00a0celebrate Dava\u2019s US roots.\n\nBy contrast, there are photographic works by the Indian artist Raghu Rai, alongside Wolfgang Tillmans and Simon Starling. The couple are patrons of emerging artists and the collection is diverse, esoteric and autobiographical \u2013 with many humorous anecdotes attached. \u201cWe began collecting around 40 years ago when we first married, starting with Peter Blake\u2019s pencil studies of a lady\u2019s bottom made in 1955\u00a0when he was a student at the RCA. From there we focused on European expressionists like Paul Klee, Jean Metzinger, Erich Mendelsohn, Marc Chagall, Sonia Delaunay and Giorgio Morandi,\u201d says John. They also share a love of abstract Indian painters including Ram\u00a0Kumar, Tyeb Mehta and Francis Newton Souza \u2013 a founding member of the Progressive Artists\u2019 Group.\n\nThe duo are strong believers in community and in preservation. In 2010, they fundraised \u00a33.5mn with the local community in Argyll to save Dunoon Burgh Hall, an\u00a01874 arts venue in the seaside town of Dunoon, where\u00a0John grew up. The building was in danger of being\u00a0torn down, so they bought it for \u00a31. It is now a thriving cultural hub and there are plans to establish a library and archive centre with their vast collection (around 2,500) of architectural and art books. McAslan is also lobbying the GLA and central government as part of a Social and Affordable Housing Initiative calling for the adaptive reuse of redundant \u201cgrey belt\u201d office space (estimated at 24mn sq ft) as a sustainable alternative to the push for new-build homes.\n\nOne of the biggest eye-openers for John is the newfound joy of crossing the Thames en route to work. \u201cI\u00a0think of the Kinks and \u2018Waterloo Sunset\u2019, romantic meetings and all that stuff. But the big change is having that distance between work and home,\u201d he says. Not to mention the novelty of using the Overground and Underground. \u201cWhen he first got on the train, we thought he might not come back!\u201d says Dava. But now both have\u00a0the pleasure of coming home through an elegant front gate. Four neighbours have already inquired after its provenance. \u201cIt is our gate!\u201d they laugh in unison.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/25a6aafa-9d69-43b8-b431-db2eab307346"}}, {"id": "94c0a904-5457-4eca-9727-4b526196f2a6", "event_name": "Chimney sweeps and mouse men should stigmatise the rest of us ", "blurb": "It is wise to acknowledge their deep understanding of nature and the elements", "date": "2025-01-2500:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is an author of fiction, cookery books and poetry anthologies.

It feels like a particularly bruising battle on both sides: impossible not to root for better air quality, but equally impossible not to understand that the days are short and the nights are wild, and the rush of a real wood fire feels like the only thing that might see you through to spring. A friend\u2019s toddler daughter, having never seen a real fire, caught a glimpse of Netflix\u2019s Fireplace For Your Home: Crackling Birchwood Fireplace. She ran off, fetched her little chair, and pulled it up close to the screen: totally transfixed. We stole it from the gods for a reason, and \u2014 Brighton council might say \u2014 they kept it from us for a reason, too.\n\nFire is always dangerous, one way or another, and the only difference between the fire we want (cosy, contained) and the fire we fear (house-consuming) is the chimney sweep. The chimney sweep, however far away you make him park, knows things you don\u2019t know about fire; about smoke; and how thin a line there is between civilisation and what simmers beneath.\n\nIt\u2019s funny that it\u2019s taken this long for chimney sweeps to dip into the stigma associated with all the other ways wildness takes over a home: nobody likes to have the exterminator parked outside; nobody wants the neighbours to know they\u2019ve had to call pest control. What if they think their mice came from inside our walls? I have, as a long-term city dweller, had to call both bedbug man and pest control in my time: bedbug man mutely fogged our home, white-suited and booted, while we took our shame out of town for the weekend.\n\nThe mouse man was a different \u2014 and wiser \u2014 story. He looked like something out of a Roald Dahl book: small, bright-eyed, and with a large, silent son in tow. \u201cFourth generation!\u201d The son nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s learning the trade,\u201d he said. The son nodded. \u201cTell the ladies how a rat ran up your arm last week, Stephen!\u201d Stephen mutely held out an arm. The mouse man beamed with pride. \u201cWhen I was his age, I thought I\u2019d be the world\u2019s first no-kill mouse man,\u201d he said, tucking little square boxes of poison into the kitchen corners. \u201cTried everything. Can\u2019t be done! You have to fight with everything you\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nHe was in his heart, he confessed, a photographer. Mainly of flowers, but other botanicals also. Some animals. He showed us the pictures on his phone. They were lovely. \u201cBut you can\u2019t quit a job like this. The mice always come back.\u201d He looked thoughtfully around our flat. \u201cMy dad did this one. So did granddad. Stephen\u2019ll do it in 10, 20 years.\u201d This exact house? This exact house.\n\n\u201cWe just keep fighting with everything we\u2019ve got,\u201d said the mouse man, cheerfully. \u201cYou done them boxes, Stephen?\u201d Stephen nodded. Then, to us: \u201cDid you follow my Instagram?\u201d We nodded. \u201cBest get on,\u201d said the mouse man. \u201cLots to do!\u201d Off he went, his son at his heels, following in the footsteps of his forefathers.\n\nAs we all do, if you think of it in primeval terms.

Estimated sales of new drugs rose from \u00a37.8bn in 2023 to \u00a38.9bn in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe NHS is delivering more newer branded drugs to patients as companies have brought forward new innovative treatments at cost effective prices,\u201d she said.\n\nThe UK is home to world-leading scientific research, particularly in the \u2018Golden Triangle\u2019 of Oxford, Cambridge and London, and large pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and GSK.\n\nBut efforts to encourage the life sciences industry to grow have faltered because of concerns over the NHS not adopting new medicines quickly enough and paying less than other countries.\n\nGermany charges the industry a similar clawback tax but recently lowered it to 7 per cent of sales and Ireland\u2019s tax is 9 per cent.\n\nAfter months of tense negotiations in 2023, the pharmaceutical industry and the government reached an agreement on a five-year deal on pricing.\n\nThe senior figure at a pharmaceutical group said that when the tax deals were signed last year, only the Department of Health was able to provide modelling, and the scenarios presented to pharmaceutical companies were \u201cmisleading\u201d.\n\nThey added that pharmaceutical groups were frustrated because the NHS had received its biggest cash injection in decades in the Autumn Budget. \u201cA massive budget increase has been given with zero added to the medicines budget,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThe pharma industry are really pissed off,\u201d said one person familiar with the matter.\n\nMark Dayan, head of public affairs at the think-tank the Nuffield Trust, said the agreement was based on the principle of variable rates based on sales trends for newer medicines.\n\n\u201cThis provides an element of predictability and control over the medicines bill and in all four countries of the UK, the NHS budget is extremely tight, often with overspends, so it will be a difficult conversation to think about reopening that deal so soon after it was signed,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said this rise is close to the clawback rates seen in the last year of the old deal, which were hitting up against the limits of what was acceptable to pharma companies.\n\nThe Department of Health said the pharmaceutical sector plays a vital role supporting the NHS and boosting UK growth: \u201cWe look forward to continuing to work in partnership with companies to tackle these together wherever we can\u201d.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nUK pharma groups try to have their cake and eat it / From Mark Samuels, Chief Executive, British Generic Manufacturers Association, London EC2, UK", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3a9f44c7-995d-4b94-98cf-b157db73cbd6"}}, {"id": "ee7a4767-7ab5-4b35-95ac-9d9fce4fa6eb", "event_name": "The Southport case puts our definition of terrorism on trial", "blurb": "Pre-empting violent crime might be possible in some circumstances if we categorise them differently", "date": "2025-01-2500:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is the UK\u2019s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation\n\nThe case of the Southport killer Axel Rudakubana raises urgent questions about how the law should apply to users of extreme violence for its own sake. Various arguments have been made in favour of amending the terrorism definition.\n\nFirst, it might be an appropriate label because only \u201cterrorism\u201d captures the social revulsion at Rudakubana\u2019s acts of violence. Second, it might help prevention, pulling in the superior resources and capabilities of the UK counter-terrorism apparatus.\n\nThird would be a legal function, possibly unlocking greater investigative powers and widening the net of criminal liability to allow police intervention and prosecution before an attack can occur. For example, a lone actor who takes early steps to a mass slaughter commits an offence \u2014 but only if it is defined as terrorism. Each argument merits real consideration but each has drawbacks, quite possibly terminal.\n\nIf the present definition of terrorism is thought to be too narrow because it does not apply to extreme violence for its own sake, a new test will be needed to distinguish between it and ordinary crime. The current test \u2014 which requires a motive of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause \u2014 tackles attempts to change our way of life through violence. Terrorism without subversion is a very different proposition, but the current definition is still wider than it seems. It does apply to new, internet-driven ideologies that justify ultraviolence, even though they may be unfamiliar and therefore harder to spot, such as end-of-days anti-system dogma, and certain variants of Satanism and \u201cincel\u201d-related beliefs.\n\nSir Keir Starmer this week floated the possibility of a new test: \u201cviolence clearly intended to terrorise\u201d. This risks too many false positives, such as domestic violence, unless the intended target is clearly the wider public not the immediate victim. Even this would still catch extortion by criminal gangs and serious hooliganism. The prime minister is, however, right about factoring in desire for notoriety, a major motivator in US school massacres.\n\nAs to resources, a wider definition will not automatically focus counter-terror police and MI5 manpower on future Southports. The national security apparatus has major threats to manage, including Isis-K and Russian sabotage. Unless the amendment was very tight, the system could be overwhelmed with dangerous and apparently dangerous individuals, vying for attention as potential terrorists.\n\nPerhaps few would argue with extending investigative powers to avert atrocities: allowing 14-day pre-charge detention in suitable cases, suspicion-less stops at air and seaports, and applying terrorism offences like possession with intent or preparatory acts to violence-obsessed individuals. But doing so would expand the harshest powers of the authorities, and the authorities can make mistakes about human motivation.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, terrorism legislation does not just apply to violence, so every inciter, encourager or publisher of atrocity-promoting material would become a terrorist, liable to special post-release measures. Complaints are already made about the scope of UK terrorism laws. Although I support the current definition as workable and adaptable, I would be cautious about pushing the law too far.\n\nPossibly the solution lies in borrowing from the tactics of counter-terrorism. Where a \u201csubject of interest\u201d is on the books, police use a range of tactics to disrupt or deter, by prosecuting non-terrorist offending or imposing anti-social behaviour injunctions. Rudakubana\u2019s danger was fizzing off him, but after he exited Prevent, the deradicalisation programme designed to divert potential extremists away from violence, there was no one to manage this risk. By which I don\u2019t mean longer-term interventions such as therapy or medical help and family support, but immediate public protection by law enforcement.\n\nThis is not about definitions, it\u2019s an organisational issue and I think a major one. It suggests the need for a wholly new capability to deal with those motivated by non-instrumental extreme violence. Operating at regional and national level, it would sit alongside counter-terrorism and serious and organised crime but separate from both.\n\nThen there is Prevent. Invented with al-Qaeda in mind, the multi-agency programme has uneasily juggled proto-terrorists and violence-lovers for years. It has been stretched to maximise police contact with school massacre obsessives and young people without any single identifiable terrorist motivation.\n\nEven if non-terrorist violence is kept within Prevent, there is a serious need for humility and imagination in the face of internet influence. Children in their bedrooms are tempted to violence by images, peer-to-peer chat and dark transgressive humour absorbed over hours and hours online.

Then they refer on to us or another provider,\u201d Langford said.\n\nDemand for bereavement support is rising, say charities. More than a quarter of a million people called The Samaritans in 2023 seeking bereavement support.\n\nWaiting times for talking therapies were six weeks or less for 92 per cent of referrals, according to recent NHS data. But many say they have to wait far longer for the right support.\n\nCruse has 83 branches in England, covering 60 per cent of areas. It also operates in Northern Ireland and Wales. The bereavement charity supported more than 22,000 people one-to-one in 2022 but is now struggling with demand.\n\nHannah Coom lost her mother to cancer in March 2024 and found herself caught between different services.

Langford said demand initially dropped in 2020 when people parked their \u201cemotional needs\u201d to prioritise physical health but struggled to meet demand when services moved online during lockdown. The emergence of \u201csuppressed emotional experiences\u201d post-crisis had resulted in a demand surge.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any big grants, there isn\u2019t an NHS contract\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009effectively what we\u2019re doing is subsidising the NHS,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cLosing a loved one can significantly impact our lives\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009which is why we\u2019ve invested record amounts into bereavement services and suicide prevention,\u201d said Claire Murdoch, NHS England\u2019s national director for mental health.\n\nThe NHS has invested \u00a357mn into suicide prevention and bereavement services during 2019-2024.

In 2023, nearly six in 10 first-time homebuyers received family assistance in getting on to the housing ladder, according to estate agent Savills.\n\nAshford said parents often placed conditions on the gifts they made \u201cto protect assets, not to stop children being able to use them. They want to make sure that if something goes wrong in their relationships or their lives, [the assets] aren\u2019t lost for the family.\u201d\n\nProblems could arise over concerns that children might go \u201coff the rails\u201d and misuse the money or among \u201csiblings of different ages who need money at different times\u201d, she said. Ashford added that children\u2019s partners could also be a source of tension, especially when they \u201ccame into the family with less wealth\u201d.\n\nFor those whose children want to buy a property with their partner, declarations of trust \u2014 legal documents that record the terms of ownership \u2014 can prove useful, CRS said. However, in the case of divorce, the family court does not have to divide the ownership in line with the declaration of trust.\n\nAdvisers say parents should start talking about the family wealth early to avoid tensions later. Conversations could start \u201cat the dinner table\u201d, said Iain Tait, head of the private investment office at wealth manager London & Capital. \u201cDon\u2019t bottle it up, because the longer you leave it, the more difficult it becomes.\u201d\n\nOllie Saiman, co-founder of wealth manager Six Degrees, said parents could teach their offspring the value of investing while protecting their assets by putting money into children\u2019s pensions. Parents can put up to \u00a32,880 each year into a junior self-invested personal pension (Sipp) and receive a 20 per cent top-up in the form of tax relief from the government.\n\n\u201cBy gifting into a Sipp you\u2019re effectively creating an investment portfolio for the child that they can see but can\u2019t access until they turn 57,\u201d said Saiman. \u201cIt can help them start to get to grips with what happens to money when you invest it.\u201d\n\nTait said parents thinking about gifting should consider their children\u2019s feelings.

She said this month she would be happy to be known as \u201cthe Iron Chancellor\u201d.\n\nThe Conservatives, however, say this is laughable. \u201cIt is clear Labour are out of their depth and out of ideas to get the economy growing,\u201d said Andrew Griffith, shadow business secretary. \u201cWorking people are paying the price for Labour\u2019s war on business.\u201d\n\nGriffith notes that for all Reeves\u2019 deregulatory talk, she is about to impose on companies a raft of new employment laws, which the government estimates will cost business \u00a35bn.\n\nBut Reeves \u2014 who this week was talking up the British economy at the World Economic Forum \u2014 has shown in recent days a willingness to use the power of her office to take decisive action across Whitehall, some of which is privately applauded by the Tories.\n\nMinisters this week ousted Marcus Bokkerink as chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, the monopolies regulator that has been criticised for allegedly hobbling growth.\n\nHis departure was a signal to other regulators they must push harder on growth, according to Treasury officials. \u201cSometimes a message has to be sent,\u201d said one.\n\nReeves\u2019 focus on spurring on regulators has received the private admiration of the opposition. \u201cWe should have done this ourselves,\u201d said one former Tory Treasury minister.\n\nYet while some Tories privately approve, Reeves\u2019 actions have ruffled some on her side of the aisle. She has been accused by former shadow chancellor John McDonnell of leaving the door open for critics to say Labour was \u201cdefending corporate abuse and profiteers\u201d. Another senior leftwing Labour MP said: \u201cIt\u2019s desperate.\u201d She appears, however, to be comfortable making such enemies.\n\nThe chancellor also sided with the banks this week in a Supreme Court case that will determine whether they have to pay out potentially tens of billions of pounds in redress in a motor finance mis-selling case. A new non-dom tax regime has been loosened.\n\nNext week, Reeves is also expected to signal her backing for airport expansion in the south-east, including Heathrow, in spite of fierce criticism from the green lobby and London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan.\n\nWhitehall insiders believe Reeves leaked the move to bounce her cabinet colleagues; Starmer himself has previously voted against a third runway at Heathrow, while Ed Miliband \u2014 who threatened to resign from Gordon Brown\u2019s government over the issue \u2014 this week played down any suggestion he would quit. Meanwhile judicial reviews of contentious infrastructure projects will be curtailed.\n\nGiven the threat posed to her precarious fiscal plan by sluggish growth, Reeves has told the Treasury to stop focusing on Budgets and concentrate on boosting investment instead.\n\nOfficials are working on a range of projects \u2014 some with fruit-related code names \u2014 to get investment into Britain.\n\nOne relates to a massive new Universal theme park being proposed for a site near Bedford, with officials close to talks between the company and Treasury saying that they are \u201cprogressing well\u201d.\n\nBackers of the project claim it could generate as much as \u00a350bn in economic value in its first 20 years. The Treasury has been asked to provide financial support, including for the upgrading of an M1 motorway junction and the building of a new station.\n\nOne official briefed on the talks, dubbed Project Mandarin, said they were nearly complete: \u201cIt\u2019s one of those negotiations you could conclude if you wanted to.\u201d Another person briefed on the talks added: \u201cIt\u2019s very close. It\u2019s almost there, but not there yet.\u201d\n\nOfficials said the package of support focused mainly on guaranteeing infrastructure investments and improvements, which will be critical to carrying the thousands of people travelling to visit the 500 acre site.\n\nExecutives at Comcast \u2014 whose Universal Destinations & Experiences is behind the scheme \u2014 have in the past told the FT that they wanted to build \u201cone of the greatest theme parks in the world\u201d.\n\nUniversal Destinations & Experiences said: \u201cWe continue to have productive discussions with the UK government.\u201d\n\nAlongside the theme park, Reeves is also trying to finalise negotiations with AstraZeneca to revive a stalled vaccine manufacturing site in Speke, Merseyside.\n\nThe project was paused after the Treasury sought to reduce the amount of state support provided to the British pharmaceutical company\u2019s vaccine centre, cutting a pledge made by the last Conservative administration from about \u00a390mn to \u00a340mn.\n\nMeanwhile Reeves is also expected to signal her support for a \u00a39bn highway and tunnel across the river Thames in east London, which would use private finance to defray the cost to taxpayers.\n\nThere are also signs that the government hopes to avoid any criticism that it is focusing all its firepower on the south east of England.\n\nThe Treasury has announced plans to review the \u201cgreen book\u201d it uses to evaluate the value of proposed investment decisions, long the focus of ire from critics who believe it favours London and the surrounding region.\n\nIt has also promised to build a pipeline of investable projects outside of the south east, with the help of the Office for Investment.

Mr Justice Nicklin and Senior Master Cook said that while either side could exceed the limit, they were unlikely to be able to recover expenses incurred above the cap if the other side were ordered to pay their costs.\n\nColin Campbell, a consultant at law firm Kain Knight and a former costs judge, said the ruling would likely work to the advantage of Associated, as the better-resourced party.\n\nThe case is the final leg of Prince Harry\u2019s protracted legal battle against the UK\u2019s tabloid press. The prince this week settled his claims against Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, after the company issued an apology for intruding into his private life and agreed to pay him \u201csubstantial\u201d damages.\n\nThe claimants in the case against Associated, who also include actor Sadie Frost and former Liberal Democrat MP Sir Simon Hughes, allege the company published stories about them in the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday based on information gathered unlawfully. Alleged techniques include \u201cblagging\u201d sensitive records through deception, using private investigators and intercepting voicemail messages.\n\nAssociated has firmly denied the claims, previously describing them as \u201csimply preposterous\u201d and \u201clurid\u201d.\n\nThe company had planned to spend \u00a319.8mn fighting the case while the claimants had budgeted for \u00a318.7mn, according to the costs ruling published on Friday.\n\nThe judges said they \u201chad little difficulty concluding that such sums were manifestly excessive\u201d.\n\nThey added that the claimants\u2019 respective legal teams had \u201cconsiderable expertise in this type of litigation and were not starting from scratch\u201d, citing other legal proceedings such as the case against Murdoch\u2019s company.\n\nThe claims were \u201creally rather simple\u201d, the judges added.

Disinformation began to spread online, including incorrect claims that the attacker was an illegal immigrant.\n\nViolent race riots followed and the authorities were later accused of a cover-up, particularly by those on the right of British politics.\n\nIt is a claim that police, prosecutors and the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, himself a senior lawyer and former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, have repeatedly denied.\n\n\u201cIf this trial had collapsed because I or anyone else had revealed crucial details while the police were investigating \u2014 while the case was being built, while we were awaiting a verdict \u2014 then the vile individual who committed these crimes would have walked away a free man,\u201d said Starmer on Tuesday.\n\nStarmer\u2019s position, and that of prosecutors, is based on British contempt of court laws dating back to the early 1980s, which restrict what information can be released ahead of a trial to prevent the jury being swayed.\n\nHowever barrister Jonathan Hall KC, who is currently reviewing terror legislation for the government, called the state\u2019s interpretation of contempt law in the Southport case \u201cultra cautious\u201d.\n\nPolice could, he told the Financial Times, have safely released Rudakubana\u2019s age, ethnicity, nationality, his birthplace of Cardiff and the fact he was from a Rwandan Christian background.\n\nNaming him would have been more complex, as he was 17 at the time, but Hall said prosecutors could and should have applied for a court order to do so.\n\n\u201cImagine if [police] had put out a clear, calm, authoritative, honest, transparent statement on Twitter [now X] early on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSome people are of course going to believe the worst, or in a conspiracy theory, but most people are just looking for information.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s silence may ironically have been counter-productive at trial, said Hall, because the jury could have had disinformation in their minds instead.\n\nThe justice system would now do well to \u201crefine\u201d its understanding of what \u201cprejudicial\u201d means in a social media era, he said, while decades-old contempt of court laws are reviewed.\n\nThe case has also sparked debate about the country\u2019s understanding of, and response to, acts of terror.\n\nWithin days of the Southport killings, police discovered that Rudakubana was in possession of an al-Qaeda training manual.\n\nProsecutors would later argue that this had been used to plan the attack. He had also manufactured the deadly poison ricin in his bedroom, before storing it in a plastic box under his bed.\n\nHowever while he was charged with the possession of terror-related material, he was not charged with committing an act of terror. Even police working on the inquiry said that they initially struggled to grasp why.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying: is this not now terrorism, is this not now terrorism, is this not now terrorism?\u201d recollected senior investigating officer Jason Pye, a detective chief inspector at Merseyside police, of his conversations with prosecutors as the evidence unfolded.\n\nA terror charge would also have made his investigation more straightforward, he said. Under terrorism legislation, Rudakubana could have been detained for seven days.\n\nWithout it, police had a maximum of 72 hours to put their case together and gather medical evidence relating to the 13 victims.\n\n\u201cIt would have absolutely meant we had the time to do a lot more things,\u201d said Pye of a terror charge.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the sheer range of material found on Rudakubana\u2019s 43 devices \u2014 coupled with his lack of explanation for his actions in interview \u2014 meant he could not be charged under the Terrorism Act 2000.\n\nThat defines terrorism as being \u201cfor the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause\u201d. It was later updated to include racial ideology.\n\nAmong more than 164,000 seized documents was violent material relating to the Nazis, Gaza, Grozny and Iraq, as well as footage of the attack on Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel in Australia last April.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t fighting for a cause,\u201d said prosecutor Deanna Heer on Thursday. \u201cHis only purpose was to kill.\u201d\n\nStarmer said this week that he understood \u201cwhy people wonder what the word \u2018terrorism\u2019 means\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd so, if the law needs to change to recognise this new and dangerous threat, then we will change it \u2014 and quickly,\u201d he added.\n\nNevertheless Hall, who is now reviewing the legislation for home secretary Yvette Cooper, said he is \u201csceptical\u201d of widening the terror definition.\n\nCasting the net more widely, he said, could bring in individuals such as football hooligans or organised criminals.\n\nRudakubana\u2019s case has also prompted questions over how well Britain\u2019s existing anti-extremism agencies are equipped to cope with young people fixated by violence.\n\nIn 2022, aged 15, he told Lancashire police that he had thought about poisoning people and manufacturing poison for that purpose, which he later did. The force said it would not comment further ahead of a public inquiry.\n\nRudakubana was also referred to the government\u2019s Prevent anti-extremism programme three times between 2019 and 2021.\n\nInitially he was referred aged 13, when his school noticed him researching school shootings online.\n\nSubsequently he was flagged for posting on Instagram about the former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi, while in April 2021 he was found to have been looking up the 2017 London Bridge terror attacks at school.\n\nOn each occasion, Prevent closed the case, noting that there was no coherent ideology behind his actions. He did not become a subject of interest for counterterror police.\n\nSpeaking ahead of sentencing, Vicki Evans, senior national co-ordinator for counterterrorism policing, said that at the time of his referrals the programme had not caught up with a new generation of extremists.\n\n\u201cAt the time the Prevent partnership response to the increasing fixation with extreme violence was evolving, but was less developed than it is today,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAlthough improvements to help tackle this challenge have been made,\u201d she added, \u201cit is right that questions are asked about what more needs to be done.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0279cab7-7ed6-4d04-8751-498dad6fbabd"}}, {"id": "d945220d-3a0e-4cb8-83dd-b4a1cbfe4ac7", "event_name": "Britain boosts electricity exports to France because of high winds ", "blurb": "France turns down power from nuclear fleet as it sucks in electricity imports from neighbour after Storm Eowyn", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "Britain boosted its electricity exports to France on Friday as high winds that ripped across the country gave it excess supplies of power.\n\nFrance turned down the power it produces from its nuclear fleet by as much as 4 gigawatts \u2014 enough for millions of homes \u2014 as it imported extra electricity from Britain, according to Montel Analytics.\n\nIt highlights the changing nature of the power system as intermittent wind and solar energy are used to provide electricity to homes, businesses and factories.\n\nWinds of up to 114mph from Storm Eowyn also show Britain\u2019s growing dependence on its neighbours to buy and sell electricity to balance out an increasingly weather-dependent power system.\n\nElectricity supply and demand has to be matched second-by-second, meaning that at times of high wind, Britain and other countries might be producing more than they can use themselves.\n\nBritain has a number of cables, known as interconnectors, that link its power system to neighbouring countries including France, Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nJean-Paul Harreman, director at Montel Analytics, said France had entered the early hours of Friday morning exporting electricity to other countries due to its own low domestic demand.\n\nBut traders soon started importing from Britain as its surfeit of electricity became clear. \u201cFrance was exporting into every country it borders,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen Britain said, we don\u2019t need your power, we want to reverse the interconnector. So France was already exporting and then it got extra power from Britain.\n\n\u201cThey [France] didn\u2019t have more capacity to export, so they turned down some of the nuclear power plants.\u201d\n\nBritain now has about 30 gigawatts of wind capacity, about half of which is offshore, where wind speeds can get very high.\n\nIf output is too high from wind and other generators and extra power cannot be exported, the country\u2019s National Energy System Operator can end up having to pay wind farms to curb their output.\n\nAs Storm Eowyn hit overnight, several wind farms in Britain had to be paid to switch off, even with the exports, according to Montel Analytics.\n\nFrance\u2019s nuclear power fleet is run by state-owned energy giant EDF, which is also building the UK\u2019s first new nuclear power station in a generation, Hinkley Point C, and wants to build a second, Sizewell C.\n\nNuclear power plants, which supply the majority of France\u2019s electricity, cannot be easily turned on and off like a gas or coal-fired power plant, but output can be adjusted up to a point.\n\nAs well as adjusting its nuclear output, France used electricity overnight to pump water up to hydropower reservoirs, meaning they are ready to dispatch the water to produce electricity when needed.\n\nBritain\u2019s electricity system is becoming more complicated to manage as it becomes more dependent on intermittent supplies of electricity from wind and solar power.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/caac56de-d357-46e5-b2c7-49738ff0fcad"}}, {"id": "072eafea-4ccd-4dd7-a1f1-5858ce279977", "event_name": "Andreessen Horowitz to close London office in pullback from UK crypto investing", "blurb": "Silicon Valley investor says it wants to refocus on US market with Donald Trump in office", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "Andreessen Horowitz is closing its London office and pulling back from its much-touted expansion into the UK, as the Silicon Valley investor seeks to refocus on the US cryptocurrency industry following the election of Donald Trump.\n\nThe group made a high-profile entry into the British capital in 2023, opening its first office outside the US with a focus on the UK\u2019s crypto industry amid a crackdown on digital assets by American regulators.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on Friday that the venture capital firm had signalled to local entrepreneurs and policymakers that it would scale back the time and money it intended to invest in the country.Soon after, Anthony Albanese, a managing director at the group who helps to lead its crypto investments, announced the firm would close its UK offices altogether.\u201cWe\u2019re excited by the enthusiasm for crypto building and adoption in the UK and are encouraged by the recent positive policy announcements and actions.

Consumer groups fear losing protections; antitrust lawyers mutter about monopolies; government departments manoeuvre to avoid cuts to bodies they sponsor. Others, meanwhile, have taken the opportunity to exhume dark warnings about the light touch regulation which fanned the flames of the 2008 crash.\n\nThe chancellor is right. Light touch regulation is not Britain\u2019s current problem. In fact regulation has been one of our few consistently reliable growth industries. There is no inherent tension between the economy and smart regulation which prevents monopolies, keeps markets competitive and promotes capital formation. But in far too many cases, we have something different: constantly changing rules which businesses struggle to keep up with; complexity spawning ranks of lobbyists; and inherent mission creep.\n\nRight now hundreds of sites with permission for high-rise housing are standing empty, because the new Building Safety Regulator is struggling to process them, eight years after the tragic Grenfell Tower fire. The Financial Conduct Authority, which failed to spot the Woodford scandal despite warnings from ex-City minister Paul Myners, seems obsessed with imposing diversity rules on companies, in a tenuous attempt to prevent \u201cgroupthink\u201d. Whatever you thought of the CMA\u2019s decision on Microsoft\u2019s application to take over a gaming company, the many months it spent dithering were unimpressive.\n\nThere is plenty of room for improvement. But while swapping one chairman (ex-Boston Consulting Group) for another (ex-Amazon, ex-McKinsey) may bring a different culture to the CMA, it\u2019s not a lasting solution. While some of these bodies are demonstrably failing, most are only as good as the remit they were given, by the politicians who set them up. The reason the UK has the highest electricity prices in Europe, crippling manufacturers, is that ministers have long used energy regulation to further their own environmental objectives.\n\nReeves\u2019 instinct is that \u201cthe balance has moved too far on regulating risk\u201d. This is partly because Whitehall itself is risk-averse. Officials, keen to de-risk decisions, have a tendency to push too many to Westminster\u2019s sprawling landscape of arms-length bodies.\u00a0Sponsor departments, in turn, are often reluctant to look too closely at how they are working: making a nonsense of the monitoring architecture, five-year reviews and impact assessments. But ministers are risk-averse too; and especially prone to \u201cSomething Must Be Done\u201d-ery. The classic example was in 2000, when the response to the terrible Hatfield rail crash was to introduce safety regulations which caused chaos and were so expensive that they in effect valued the life of a train passenger at over a hundred times more than one in a car.\n\nIn 2015, when I was working in Downing Street, I was surprised to discover that a Whitehall department I was dealing with didn\u2019t even have a list of the regulations it was responsible for. I asked a senior adviser what had happened to the \u201cbonfire of the quangos\u201d which George Osborne had launched five years before.\u00a0Initially annoyed by my scepticism, he eventually admitted that while some inroads had been made, the system had pushed back, and the result was less a bonfire than a tiny spark.\u00a0In 2021, the Public Accounts Committee found that spending by those bodies had since trebled; and Meg Hillier, the PAC\u2019s Labour chair, challenged the then government to explain why they were set up in the first place.\n\nBritain used to be really good at smart regulation. The creation of\u00a0regulatory sandboxes, and the speedy rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine, shows that we still can be.\u00a0But government also needs to ask itself some hard questions about what the state is for, and why we need bodies with confusing levels of overlap. Do we really need both Ofgem and the National Energy System Operator? The Environment Agency and Natural England? When Great British Railways is launched, what will be the point of the Office of Rail and Road?\n\nSir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, argues that the regulation of energy and water has become far too complex. He has proposed that they be regulated as networks, through a single regulator. That would be a much more effective approach. And unless we are able to flex our regulatory systems to better perform their objectives, how will Britain ever be nimble enough to cope with advances in AI, or synthetic drugs?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a raving libertarian to feel that Reeves is on the right track. The problem, of course, is the dissonance between what the chancellor and business secretary are saying, and what the government is actually doing. It is setting up a large number of new arms-length bodies. And it is on the verge of unleashing an unprecedented set of new employment regulations, many of which will be unworkable. Just one little clause in that package will make every pub subject to being sued by both their staff and their customers \u2014 because its demand that employers protect their employees from harassment will clash directly with customers\u2019 right to free speech.\n\nThere is still time to get this right.

Some of these companies took additional, proactive steps to reduce further spread of the material,\u201d the regulator said. \u201cX Corp chose not to remove the video from its platform.\u201d\n\nThe footage of the stabbing circulated online in April but X only geoblocked the footage in Australia, meaning that people elsewhere in the world, and local users of VPNs, could continue to view the violent attack.\n\nUK home secretary Yvette Cooper said this week that the government was contacting X directly to ask it to remove the video from the platform. \u201cCompanies should not be profiting from hosting content that puts children\u2019s lives at risk,\u201d she told the House of Commons.\n\nRudakubana, 18, was sentenced to life with a minimum of 52 years in prison on Thursday after admitting to the murder of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport.\n\nMusk posted on X repeatedly in the wake of the killings, accusing UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of \u201cprioritising mosques over British girls in their dance classes\u201d.

Six minutes before he left to carry out the murders, he had searched X for \u201cmar mari emmanuel stabbing\u201d.\n\nWhen police carried out the same search of X during their investigation, they found it led to posts containing footage of the Sydney attack three months earlier.\n\nThe prosecution also outlined Rudakubana\u2019s online profiles and social media handles in court, including his X account. As of Friday, his X account \u2014 which is protected, so that only followers could see his posts \u2014 had not been taken down.\n\nThe Australian regulator sought to take legal action to try to force X to comply with a ruling to fully remove the video in April, a move that divided the country over whether the government was suppressing free speech or was correct to protect social media users from harmful and violent content.\n\nMusk criticised the decision, accusing the eSafety \u201ccommissar\u201d of trying to censor the internet.\n\nThat provoked a furious reaction from the country\u2019s politicians, including Anthony Albanese, the prime minister, who said it was \u201cdistressing\u201d that X was fighting the order to remove the video and criticised the billionaire\u2019s stance.\n\nHowever, a court opted against extending an injunction on the video being shown on the basis that X had taken \u201creasonable steps\u201d to stop the video being shown in Australia.

Three weeks into the new year and one topic dominates client meetings: pensions and inheritance tax (IHT). Some families could now be paying hundreds of thousands of pounds extra in tax on death due to coming rule changes. Many want to start planning to avoid this now.\n\nTake two of our clients, Mark and Nicola (not their real names). Their strategy had been smart \u2014 fully funding Isas while also salary sacrificing big contributions from their business into pensions, simultaneously reducing their corporation tax bill.\n\nThey were heading for a comfortable retirement, with a nice home in Yorkshire and investable assets of more than \u00a33mn. And they had the reassurance that their children would also be financially secure, because nearly all of what was left of their estate on death would be free of IHT.\n\nLast year\u2019s Budget shattered that dream. Now, if our couple die suddenly soon after April 6 2027, their sons could face an IHT bill of more than \u00a31mn.\n\nThe total tax charge on money left in a pension to loved ones might now be 64 per cent. This is because pensions face a double tax hit. First, there is the 40 per cent IHT charge. That would make a \u00a31mn pension pot worth \u00a3600,000. Next, the rules as they stand mean that if you die after the age of 75, anyone drawing money from that pension pot will pay income tax at their marginal rate. At 40 per cent, that could mean another \u00a3240,000 eventually going to HM Revenue & Customs.\n\nBut it could be worse. Because of tax tapers, the marginal rate for those earning between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3125,140 is 60 per cent \u2014 an anomaly Rachel Reeves sadly left unchanged. That would give HMRC 76 per cent on funds extracted by a beneficiary who fell within this income band.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. Adding pensions to IHT\u00a0has made some families worry\u00a0they\u2019ll topple over the tax cliff edge that arises because of the gradual withdrawal of the residence nil rate band for estates over \u00a32mn.\n\nI won\u2019t bombard you with the maths. Suffice to say that in some circumstances the marginal rate of IHT alone becomes 60 per cent. Add in income tax and, in extremes, the tax could in effect be as much as 84 per cent. You would have to be poorly advised to pay that. At least you have control over the drawing down of benefits so you could make an inherited pension the last pot you draw from, holding off until your marginal rate is lower. But it doesn\u2019t make life simple!\n\nOn top of the pensions issue is the halving of business property reliefs beyond \u00a31mn, which has riled so many farming families. On some farms \u00a31mn does not even cover the cost of machinery, leaving many wondering whether farms that go back generations can remain viable. This has rightly generated a lot of coverage, but entrepreneurs wanting to pass on businesses or who die unexpectedly while still in harness face a similar challenge.\n\nAll these changes are forcing many families to bring forward gifting strategies, triggering a \u201cbeat-the-clock\u201d game of passing on large parts of their estate seven years before they expect to die to avoid any IHT.\n\nThe new rules on pensions will not come into effect until 2027, but at a time of year when many of us are reviewing our finances, it is a good idea to start considering the implications today if IHT affects your family.\n\nFor some it will make sense to draw the tax-free lump sum from their pensions \u2014 25 per cent of any pot up to a maximum of \u00a3268,275 \u2014 and give that to the children as a one-off gift to help with house purchases. This will be subject to the seven-year gifting rules, reducing the nil-rate band available on death within seven years of the gift. Any tax liability tapers after three years.\n\nA simpler approach is to give the money gradually, drawing down more from your pensions and investments than you need and giving the excess away. Yes, you pay income tax but remember that you enjoyed a tax break on your pension contributions and couples who pool their assets smartly may be able to reduce the impact of income taxes.\n\nGifts from excess income are free of IHT but I suggest making regular monthly payments and keeping a record of all transactions in case HMRC challenges your estate on death.\n\nThe changes force people to review other assets, too. I have been asked about putting holiday homes into the children\u2019s names. It is not that simple. If the property has risen in value since bought it you could find yourself with a big capital gains tax bill. Be aware too that you may have to pay rent to continue to use it. And your children will be entitled to sell it if they need the money. You will lose control. A shared ownership structure may be more effective.\n\nWith any gifting strategy there is always the risk of giving too much too soon. Many clients worry about demotivating the next generation. Others are concerned about the money being lost through divorce. This last one can be addressed to some degree with legal contracts. I know some farming families, for instance, who are creating a family constitution. This includes as a condition of inheritance that any family member marrying \u2014 or remarrying (this applies as much to the parents as the children) \u2014\u00a0should agree a pre-nup. And if already married they should go for a post-nup. The constitution brings a degree of professionalism to an emotional subject. It is a way of saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t dislike your spouse, and it is not personal. We are just trying to ensure the viability of the family\u2019s legacy for future generations.\u201d\n\nThe other big risk with bringing forward gifting strategies is that you end up short yourself late in life when most vulnerable and needing care. Gradual giving can help mitigate this risk.\n\nWith the best care homes costing more than \u00a34,000 a week, you need to do some serious cash flow planning, considering possible scenarios. Your greatest gift to your children can be that you are still financially self-sufficient in later life. As ever, do not let an obsession with avoiding tax or ignorance of the rules lead you into financial folly.\n\nClare Munro is a tax adviser at Weatherbys Private Bank", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ca4ffbeb-7437-4cbf-97d4-96633615e75c"}}, {"id": "14ba1580-52bf-4b87-9707-2817bd9e81f1", "event_name": "Blackstone nears deal to take full control of UK railway arches ", "blurb": "US private equity group closes in on buyout of partner\u2019s stake in \u00a32bn portfolio", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "Blackstone is closing in on a deal to take full control of a \u00a32bn portfolio of more than 5,000 UK railway arches, buying out its partner five years after a deal that symbolised the advance of US private equity into the UK economy.\n\nThe US private capital group, which is the world\u2019s largest commercial property investor, has agreed to buy TT Group\u2019s half of the portfolio, which the two investors acquired from Network Rail for \u00a31.5bn in 2019, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe transaction would involve Blackstone buying out TT\u2019s stake in the Arch Company, which owns the portfolio.

Axel Rudakubana has been handed one of the longest jail terms in UK history \u2014 he will serve at least 52 years in prison before becoming eligible for parole. It comes after he admitted to the murder of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, at a dance class in Southport last July.\n\nIt is highly likely he will never be released.\n\nIt is also very probable the law will end up being tweaked so that in the event of a similar future case (the only reason why Rudakubana did not receive a whole life sentence is that he was 17 at the time of the murders) the possibility of parole in cases like these is downgraded from \u201cwholly theoretical\u201d to \u201cnon-existent\u201d.\n\nThe more complicated question is about how and if the UK counterterror system should change in response. I wrote a bit about that earlier this week, but now that he has been sentenced and I can write more freely I want to revisit some of it and address some of the trade-offs and some of the misconceptions about the policy challenge.\n\nThe challenge that the Southport murders pose for the British state is that it is not a mental health story or a \u201ctraditional\u201d terror story. Many of your responses to Tuesday\u2019s newsletter talked about the deleterious effects of cuts to children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and other youth services more broadly during the last government.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that these cuts have not had important negative effects for the health and happiness of people in the UK. But they were not a factor in this case: Axel Rudakubana was not, and is not, mentally ill. His defence team did not submit any evidence of mental illness and indeed their submission in mitigation was deliberately and explicitly thin. Rudakubana\u2019s defence was led by Stanley Reiz KC, one of our most respected criminal defence lawyers. He had a Rolls-Royce defence team, and you can be sure that had there been an even halfway-plausible case to be made in mitigation about Rudakubana\u2019s mental health they would have found it and made it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a case about a young man of unsound mind committing a series of horrific crimes. It\u2019s one of a young, violent man consciously planning and choosing to commit an atrocity. But nor is it one of a young, violent man doing so in service of a particular cause. Police seized 43 electronic devices from Rudakubana\u2019s house, and were able to access the contents of 32 of them. They contained more than 164,000 downloaded documents spanning a vast range of extreme violent imagery and information. But what they did not contain was any evidence of an underlying motivation beyond a desire to commit a horrific act of violence.\n\nRudakubana was known to CAMHS, had been expelled from his school, and was three times referred to Prevent, the deradicalisation programme. He had been convicted for assaulting another student. In November 2019, he was referred to Prevent by a teacher after searching for information about mass shootings on a school computer. In February 2021, he was again referred, this time after a pupil reported he had uploaded images of Muammer Gaddafi to Instagram. Two months later he was referred again by a teacher who noted that he had two tabs open about the 2017 London Bridge attack. Between October 2019 and May 2022, Lancashire police responded to five calls about his behaviour from his home address.\n\nOne reason why Rudakubana\u2019s referrals to Prevent didn\u2019t go anywhere is that on no occasion did Prevent find evidence of any underlying ideological reason for Rudakubana\u2019s behaviour other than an interest in violence. And he did not end up being detained for his own safety and that of others because he was not mentally ill. The UK, like most states, essentially has two routes to pre-emptively stop atrocities, and neither fitted Rudakubana. The challenge facing the government is: is it possible to construct a route that would?\n\nAnyone who is familiar with mass shootings will note some immediate similarities. Martin Bryant, who in 1996 killed 35 and injured 23 others in Port Arthur, in what was the deadliest massacre in Australia\u2019s history, had studied the Dunblane massacre which occurred earlier that year. Seung-Hui Cho, the perpetrator of the Virginia Tech shootings, was reportedly transfixed by the 1999 Columbine high school massacre.\n\nNow, most mass killings are not considered to be acts of terrorism, though there are occasional calls in the US to treat all school shootings as terrorism, and calls in many parts of the world to treat some or all forms of domestic violence as terrorism. (I will return to both of these at a later date as they have implications for how the British state might respond to the Southport murders.)\n\nOur understanding of why mass shooters \u2014 and more broadly, \u201cspree killers\u201d who may use other weapons \u2014 do what they do is not very good, in part because so many mass shooters either end up shooting themselves or being shot by law enforcement. Our ability to detect \u201clone wolves\u201d of any description is already limited. Frankly, the only policy lever that any nation has found that works to reduce this problem is gun control. It\u2019s the lever that Britain pulled after Dunblane, and tightened further after the Plymouth shooting in 2021. It\u2019s the lever that Australia pulled after Port Arthur, too.\n\nThe state clearly failed multiple times to spot the threat that Rudakubana posed. While it may be easy to look at the list of instances and go \u201cwell, why is the home secretary fretting about making it harder to buy kitchen knives on Amazon?\u201d*, that is misplaced. While taking steps on the purchase of knives addresses a very small part of what went wrong here, this is the lever that we know works. Yvette Cooper is absolutely right to want to make buying a knife as tough as she possibly can. We will never be able to outright stop the use of knives, so there is a limit to how far she can go, but she is absolutely right to explore it.\n\nBoth Cooper and Keir Starmer have argued that this case is a reason to change the UK\u2019s counterterror system so that it is better geared up to address and monitor \u201cviolence for the sake of violence\u201d, and the new, more incoherent \u201cpick and mix\u201d terrorism that MI5 director-general Ken McCallum warned about in his annual threat update last autumn. They have asked Jonathan Hall, the government\u2019s independent reviewer, to review whether the UK\u2019s definition of terrorism needs to be expanded.\n\nWhat we define as terrorism matters in this case because we grant greater powers to law enforcement to detain, search and monitor people if they are engaging in acts defined as terrorism than we do common murderers.\n\nThere are inevitably trade-offs here. For example, there would be reductions in freedom and liberty if we were to increase the scope of what is and isn\u2019t considered to be terrorism. It also places strain on the security services and on the UK\u2019s counterterror resources. As Hall himself said in an interview with the Times:\n\nThis is genuinely difficult. Taken together, Hall\u2019s review, Cooper\u2019s beefed-up scrutiny of the Prevent programme and the new inquiry into the failures to pick up Rudakubana will provide a useful framework to assess how and whether we should go further.\n\nAn important difference between Islamist extremist terror (roughly 75 per cent of MI5\u2019s counterterror caseload) and the extreme far right (roughly 25 per cent) is that Islamist extremists tend to aim for mass death, while the extreme far right tends to go for specific targets.\n\nThere are exceptions to that, of course, but \u201cmass death\u201d may well be the way to square this circle. Rudakubana was cultivating ricin for that very purpose. Treating violence designed to inflict mass death for its own sake as a form of terrorism might be a way to marry Starmer\u2019s desire for greater powers with Hall\u2019s justified concerns about it swamping the security services.\n\n*Full disclosure, one of the pundits to have been thoughtlessly and reflexively dismissive of that measure is me, as listeners who heard me on LBC\u2019s Cross Question will know.

Their successors not so much", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "The idea behind the concept of generations is that people born at a certain time share similar experiences, which in turn shape common attitudes.\n\nThe \u201cGreatest\u201d and \u201cSilent\u201d generations, born in the early decades of the 20th century, witnessed economic adversity and global conflict, going on to form relatively leftwing views. Baby boomers grew up accustomed to growth and prosperity, and went on to lean strongly conservative.\n\nIt was a similar story for millennials, who entered adulthood in the aftermath of the global financial crisis to be greeted by high unemployment, anaemic income growth, and ballooning house price to income ratios, going on to champion strongly progressive politics.\n\nA lot of analysis and discourse treats millennials and Gen Z as close cousins, united in their struggle to achieve the prosperity of earlier generations. But the validity of that elision depends a lot on where you look.\n\nMillennials right across the western world really were united in their economic malaise. From the US and Canada to Britain and western Europe, the cohort born in the mid to late 1980s lived its formative adult years against a backdrop of weak or stagnant wage growth and cratering rates of home-ownership.\n\nAbsolute upward mobility \u2014 the extent to which members of one generation earn more than their parents\u2019 generation at the same age \u2014 fell steadily. In the US, by the time someone born in 1985 turned 30, their average income was only a few per cent above that of their parents at the same age, a far cry from the clear, palpable generation-over-generation gains of 50 to 60 per cent made by those born in the 1950s.\n\nOn both sides of the Atlantic, the narrative of millennial malaise is no myth. They may go down as the most economically unlucky generation of the past century.\n\nBut we then hit a fork in the road. For young adults in Britain and most of western Europe, conditions have only got worse since. If you thought the sub-1 per cent annual growth in living standards endured by millennials was bad, try sub-zero. Britons born in the mid 1990s have seen living standards not merely stagnate but decline. Right across Europe, there is precious little for the youngest adults to be happy about.\n\nBut in America, Gen Z are motoring ahead. US living standards have grown at an average 2.5 per cent per year since the cohort born in the late 1990s entered adulthood, blessing this generation not only with far more upward mobility than their millennial elders, but with more rapidly improving living standards than young boomers had at the same age. And it\u2019s not just incomes: Gen Z Americans are also outpacing millennials in their climb up the housing ladder.\n\nAll the signs are that in the US, the decades-long slowdown in generation-on-generation economic progress has not only stopped but gone into reverse. Americans born in 1995 are enjoying even more upward mobility relative to their parents than those born in 1965. Zoomers by name, zoomers by socio-economic nature.\n\nBoth the change in young Americans\u2019 economic trajectories and the divergence from their European counterparts pose interesting questions.\n\nFrom a sociological perspective, in an age of borderless social media narratives and algorithms that reward negativity, can the meme of young adult adversity survive contact with America\u2019s Gen Z reality? And with a stream of negative social comparisons only a smartphone away, how will the growing realisation that young Americans are on a higher trajectory affect young Europeans?\n\nTurning to politics, will the youngest cohort of American voters tread its own path? The fact that it was not only the youngest men but also young women who swung behind Donald Trump in the US election suggests this may already be happening. A group that comes to see itself as among life\u2019s winners may not develop the same instinct for social solidarity that its downtrodden predecessors came to hold.\n\nIn an era of \u201cvibe shifts\u201d, the pivot from a sense of downward mobility to one of rising prosperity may prove the biggest yet. A divergence in the mood music on either side of the Atlantic will also surely inject fresh urgency into Europe\u2019s search for an uptick of its own.\n\nWhichever way you look at it, the restarting of the economic conveyor belt in America could prove to be a hugely significant moment.\n\njohn.burn-murdoch@ft.com, @jburnmurdoch", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/25867e65-68ec-4af4-b110-c1232525cf5c"}}, {"id": "671f6042-8d39-481b-bd2d-d687ce3e17d1", "event_name": "London mansion sold for \u00a3139mn to mystery buyer", "blurb": "The Holme is one of a few private residences located inside\u200b\u200b Regent\u2019s Park", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "A Regent\u2019s Park mansion formerly owned by Saudi royals that fell into receivership nearly two years ago has sold for \u00a3139mn to a mystery buyer in one of London\u2019s largest ever property sales.\n\nThe Holme, which sits in a four-acre private garden within \u200b\u200bRegent\u2019s Park in central London, has been sold to a UK subsidiary of Zedra, a corporate service and wealth management firm that runs trusts on behalf of various clients, according to UK land records.\n\nThe \u00a3138.9mn sale vies with billionaire Adar Poonawalla\u2019s roughly \u00a3138mn purchase of Aberconway House in Mayfair in 2023 as the second most expensive house ever sold in London.\n\n\u201cThis is a once-a-decade kind of property\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009a mini stately home in the middle of London, in its own parkland,\u201d said Roarie Scarisbrick, a buying agent at Property Vision. \u201cThis is not a house for the shy and retiring type.\u201d\n\nUK companies have to publicly register their beneficial owners. This requirement was extended to overseas companies that own property in the UK in order to increase transparency after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut there are still gaps in the regime, which have drawn criticism from transparency advocates and some lawmakers. The individuals behind some properties can still be obscured through trusts, where information about the ultimate beneficiaries is disclosed to the government but not made public.\n\nProposing transparency measures in 2023, then-housing secretary Michael Gove said: \u201cTrusts can be used for wholly legitimate reasons. But they can, and are, created with deliberately labyrinthine structures to obscure the ownership of assets and make it easier for corrupt individuals to operate.\u201d\n\nThe company registered as the new owner of the Holme is controlled by a Luxembourg-based Zedra entity, according to corporate records.\n\nThe UK government has published new draft regulations that will allow anyone to apply for information about trusts held in the register of overseas property owners \u2014 with certain limits, for example, to protect information about minors. If approved, the regulations are expected to take effect in August.\n\nThe Holme came on the market in early 2023 seeking a price as high as \u00a3250mn after debts secured against the property expired. It was previously bought on behalf of Prince Khaled bin Sultan al-Saud of Saudi Arabia and his family in 1991 via a Guernsey-registered company called Quendon Ltd, which later listed five of Prince Khaled\u2019s children as beneficial owners.\n\nThe 207-year-old villa, which is owned on a long lease from the Crown Estate, would probably require complex and costly renovations given its heritage status, people familiar with the property said.

The fund is known for its debt strategies, and made a multimillion-pound loan to Quendon secured on the property.\n\nAttestor and Zedra declined to comment. Agents Knight Frank and Beauchamp Estates, who were appointed to sell the house, declined to comment.\n\nLondon\u2019s most expensive house sale, the 45-room mansion at 2-8a Rutland Gate, was secretly agreed just before the Covid-19 pandemic and involved a British Virgin Islands company buying the property for \u00a3210mn from a Cura\u00e7ao-registered entity.

Her passing was so unexpected that when the news first reached me, I felt sure it was a scam. Alas.\n\nAs we slowly adjust to life without her, there is some comfort that it all happened so quickly. Survived by my godfather, she has also been spared the trauma of dealing with the administrative and financial aftermath had he died first. It turns out this is something that had worried her in her later years, and finding that out has made me even sadder.\n\nWith major changes to the inheritance tax treatment of pensions on the horizon, I fear the grim complexity of sorting out a deceased person\u2019s financial affairs while you are grieving can only get worse.\n\nMy FT colleague Miranda Green used the term \u201cSadmin\u201d to describe it. We received an overwhelming response to a podcast we made last year about her protracted struggle with financial providers to settle her late father\u2019s estate.\n\nOne detail that will forever stick in my mind is a phone call she made informing her dad\u2019s private pension provider of his death, which resulted in her being quizzed about an apparent overpayment. So much for empathy! \u201cYou do feel that you\u2019re talking to a faceless bureaucracy that no longer cares because that person isn\u2019t going to take their business elsewhere,\u201d she reflected at the time.\n\nFirms urgently need to pull their socks up, but so too does the government. Grieving families have been navigating long delays in the probate system since the pandemic, and more estates are being drawn into the inheritance tax net. HMRC reported an 11 per cent year-on-year increase in IHT receipts this week, and this is set to rise substantially in 2027, when IHT will be applied to inherited pension pots.\n\nAs a consultation on the measures ended this week, financial providers branded the proposals \u201cunworkable\u201d claiming they will lead to increased costs and severe delays in money being paid to bereaved families, even in cases where no IHT is due.\n\nThe key sticking point they are urging the Treasury to rethink is who pays the IHT bill. Under the current proposals, pension schemes would be responsible for paying any IHT due directly to HMRC before any funds are distributed. Yet in order to calculate any tax liability, providers would have to work with executors to find out the value of other pensions and the person\u2019s wider estate, and how to apportion the nil rate band.\n\nAny readers who have ever tried communicating with a pension company will know that the speed of response to the most basic of queries is often glacial. So what are the chances of pension schemes correctly calculating IHT liability within six months of a person\u2019s death, after which late interest payments will be incurred?\n\nThe Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association has sensibly proposed that estates should be responsible for paying the tax, with an extended 12- month period to settle before any interest is charged, to give families and pension schemes time to work out the calculations.\n\nIt has also raised important questions about how IHT will be applied to death-in-service payments. A form of life insurance for employees, I have previously urged readers to ask HR departments if such benefits are linked to a pension scheme, and thus potentially subject to IHT in future (if yours are, ask what your firm intends to do about this before 2027).\n\nAn awful lot of misery and additional distress could be avoided if the government listens and responds to these concerns. But what about the steps we can personally take to prepare for the inevitable and make things easier for those we leave behind?\n\nIf you enjoy reading personal finance articles in the FT, chances are you are the \u201cmoney person\u201d in your household. I certainly am \u2014 so it doesn\u2019t have to be divided along gender lines \u2014 but advisers tell me it frequently is. Nor is this issue confined solely to older generations. I have a great many friends \u2014 including same sex couples \u2014 who are happy to outsource virtually all financial management to their other half.\n\nThis risks storing up big problems in the future if the \u201cmoney person\u201d dies first \u2014 and even more so if the couple were not married or in a civil partnership and thus unable to share tax allowances and defer IHT bills until the second death.\n\nIf the money person was also the biggest earner, assets such as pensions are likely to have been built up in their sole name. IHT changes will require pension providers to be informed promptly of a person\u2019s death \u2014 but what if a surviving spouse does not know about them?\n\nA decade of auto enrolment means people have pension pots from previous jobs all over the place, resulting in an estimated \u00a331bn worth of \u201clost\u201d pensions \u2014 a problem that can only compound.\n\nI did an item about this on daytime TV two weeks ago, and was bombarded with messages on social media from widowed women telling me of their struggle to find old pensions and life insurance policies they thought their husbands had taken out. Many messages were tinged with a sense of shame about their inability to navigate the system and track down this much-needed money. Heartbreaking.\n\nFree digital services such as Gretel are making this slightly easier, but the industry needs to take much better ownership of this problem.\n\nAs do we all, of course. How prepared would your partner be if the worst happened, or if you were suddenly taken ill and unable to manage the finances? It\u2019s easier if you have a financial adviser, but often, they will only have a relationship with the \u201cfinancial lead\u201d of the family.\n\nA recent study by Boring Money found that women over 65 who display at least one \u201cvulnerable\u201d characteristic were the least satisfied with financial advice \u2014 the key shortcoming being clarity and communication.\n\nAs well as sorting the basics such as your wills, lasting powers of attorney and life insurance, the digital nature of modern finances is another problem. Miranda had several Tesco bags full of old paperwork to help piece together her father\u2019s affairs. If your finances are in the cloud, how much more difficult is this process going to be?\n\nI recommend a workbook called I\u2019m Dead: Now What? that you can buy online and fill in with helpful instructions about all kinds of things (not just money) that will make things easier for those you leave behind.\n\nHaving conversations with our nearest and dearest about these things while we are still alive is awkward.

They acted after BHS\u2019s collapse sparked questions about whether audits of non-listed companies should be scrutinised in greater depth to prevent similar failures.\n\nThe designation would place the audits of roughly 600 non-listed companies with 750 employees and more than \u00a3750mn in annual turnover under a tighter regulatory system overseen by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).\n\nReynolds told the Financial Times in 2023 that, if Labour won power, it would push through the long-delayed reforms. But one person familiar with the government\u2019s thinking said the reforms were now \u201cancient history\u201d because tighter auditing requirements were viewed as \u201canother barrier, a ceiling to growth\u201d.\n\nWith Reynolds worried that the proposals would incentivise companies to duck below the 750-employee mark or move overseas, the government might instead compile a list of firms selected for qualitative \u201cimportance\u201d or abandon the proposals altogether, the person added.\n\nMinisters have in recent weeks vowed to pursue growth, and last month ordered 17 of the biggest watchdogs to set out measures to boost the economy.\n\nOn Tuesday, the government forced out the chair of the competition regulator after taking the view that the agency was not sufficiently focused on growth.\n\nThe FRC was first tasked in 2018 with improving audit quality after a rash of high-profile failures.\u00a0The previous Tory government drew up a package of reforms, which included replacing the current regulator with the more powerful Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority.\n\nBut it watered down the proposals in 2022, reducing the number of new PIEs from as many as 2,000 to 600.\n\nAuditors had complained about the tighter scrutiny applied by the regulator in relation to PIEs, with top 10 firm Grant Thornton saying it had sworn off 70 per cent of its PIE work in the five years to 2022.\n\nLabour used its first King\u2019s Speech last year to promise a draft Audit Reform and Corporate Governance bill. The draft legislation might still include the current PIE proposals, one of the people said, and ministers could opt to hash out the details in parliament.\n\nOne ally of Reynolds said the minister was still open-minded about the \u201cspecific thresholds\u201d to apply to PIE, adding that the business secretary was listening carefully to views on the subject and considering the wider economic impact of the audit reforms.\n\nThe Department for Business and Trade said it would welcome the thoughts of interested parties before publishing the draft bill later this year.\n\n\u201cOur top priority is boosting the economy and raising living standards for working people and that\u2019s why our audit reform is focused on growth and supporting business to invest,\u201d the department added.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/231ef062-8f89-4efb-a38e-9f6bee960fd4"}}, {"id": "96b8d68d-1860-42ee-8568-bbe3650e4371", "event_name": "How to buy leasehold and avoid \u2018fleecehold\u2019", "blurb": "Buyers urged to beware of an ownership sector that remains wide open to abuse", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "Ordinary people hit with enormous, life-changing bills; families stuck in unsafe buildings; homeowners forced to pay rip-off charges to faceless management companies \u2014 the steady drumbeat of leasehold scandal stories is alarming if, like me, you are planning to buy a flat in London.\n\nLeasehold is a curiously English type of home ownership, where buyers purchase the right to live in a home, typically a flat, for a set amount of years, rather than the property itself. Usually, they also pay a ground rent, and a \u201cservice charge\u201d covering the maintenance of the property. Detractors describe the system as a feudal relic; overly complicated and riddled with scope for abuse.\n\nSebastian O\u2019Kelly, chief executive of the campaign group Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, says the problem is \u201cprivate equity punters\u201d who have found ways to exploit the system. Many believe \u201cfleecehold\u201d needs to be abolished.\n\nReform has been on the horizon for years, but has been repeatedly delayed \u2014 most recently, a law rushed through parliament in the final days of the last government was found to have \u201cflaws\u201d, according to ministers. While the government announced that one measure, eliminating the two-year wait to extend a lease after purchasing a flat, took effect on Wednesday, consultations on how to implement some other parts of the new law are expected this year.\n\nIn the meantime, what do I do? I\u2019m preparing to move and, although I have owned a leasehold flat with no problems, I am acutely aware of what could go wrong.\n\n\u201cI just wouldn\u2019t go near any of that leasehold stuff,\u201d a friend advised me as we discussed it after dinner. I looked around his elegant London house and thought: easy for you to say.\n\nSome 4.8mn properties in England are leasehold \u2014 just under a fifth of the total. In London, which has a large number of flats, the proportion rises to one in three. Avoiding leasehold implies a big sacrifice in the location and type of property I can buy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a toxic system per se,\u201d says Mark Chick, senior partner at law firm Bishop & Sewell and a director of the Association of Leasehold Enfranchisement Practitioners. \u201cThe system can be navigated successfully. It is just a system where there have been historic abuses or individual examples of poor behaviour,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cAs a species, it works,\u201d says Chick. \u201cThere are plenty of people who do own flats and don\u2019t have problems.\u201d\n\nSo if you are buying leasehold, how can you better protect yourself from the exploitative and neglectful?\n\nThe first step is to be clear on what it is you\u2019re buying. When you purchase any apartment anywhere, you usually sign up to pay a share of the cost of running and maintaining the building, whatever that may be \u2014 but unlike with a house, you don\u2019t have total control over these. On top of that, comes the leasehold system.\n\nCharley Lowe, solicitor at law firm Wedlake Bell, says misunderstandings are common. \u201cI have many clients who come to me when buying a flat and when I refer to \u2018the lease\u2019 they say \u2018hang on, I\u2019m not renting it, I\u2019m buying it\u2019, so there is certainly a lack of understanding generally,\u201d she says.\n\nSome leasehold apartments have an arrangement where the residents have control of the service charge, rather than a freeholder. Other flats are sold as \u201cshare of freehold\u201d, where the building is jointly owned. Both are seen as superior, as it means the apartment owners have greater control over costs, although the responsibility can be time consuming and disagreements absolutely can occur.\n\nWhen searching for a flat, getting your hands on all the relevant information is often not as easy as you might think: many online listings don\u2019t specify the service charge or ground rent, or even how long is left on the lease (renewing can be costly, especially once it falls below 80 years). Estate agents will provide these details when asked, but ask for more and it can get tricky.\n\nDuring my own search, I asked one agent for a copy of the lease \u2014 essentially the contract that I would be signing, but was told the seller didn\u2019t want to \u201cdig it out\u201d. (You can get it from the Land Registry, by post, for a small fee.)\n\nMatt Lewis, consultant solicitor at Commonhold and Leasehold Experts, says that a problem with the conveyancing system in England and Wales \u2014 and this goes for freehold too \u2014 is that \u201cyou only get pertinent information later on, by which point you\u2019ve spent considerable sums of money on legal services and perhaps committed to other costs such as surveys\u201d.\n\nThere are some questions you can ask up front, however (see box)\n\nO\u2019Kelly says a good solicitor is important. \u201cChoose one carefully and pay them properly\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. You [should not] use a \u2018factory\u2019 conveyancing legal service when buying a flat \u2014 and certainly never employ a lawyer recommended by an estate agent or a developer.\u201d\n\nThe most well-known problem with leasehold flats is cladding, which was thrown into the limelight by the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017. The disaster led to much stricter rules on fire safety in blocks of flats, contained in the 2022 Building Safety Act.\n\nThe first thing to note is that it\u2019s not just cladding \u2014 buildings are now thoroughly assessed for fire risk and problems must be rectified. Common problem areas to look out for are inadequate fire-stopping (gaps in walls to stop fires spreading), flammable balcony materials and insufficiently fire-resistant doors, says Lewis.\n\nGetting these fixed is often expensive and figuring out who will pay for it is crucial. Lewis described the law in this area as \u201cparticularly complex and contains a fair amount of traps for the unwary\u201d, so get specialist advice if you want to buy a flat in this situation.\n\nEveryone I spoke to for this article said it was important to find out who the managing agent and freeholder are, and research them online.\n\n\u201cIf you end up looking at a property that has one of those notorious landlords, that\u2019s probably a red flag and you\u2019re going to want to walk away,\u201d says one solicitor who declined to be named.\n\nO\u2019Kelly says to look at press coverage, court reports, Companies House and the website of his own Leasehold Knowledge Partnership. \u201cThe really big landlords, all of them are abusing the system, in my view,\u201d he says.\n\nManaging agents should also be checked. There is no formal regulation of these companies, but being accredited to trade body The Property Institute is a good sign.\n\nWhat if, after you purchase, something goes wrong, or you suspect malpractice?\n\nFirst, scrutinise your annual service charge accounts \u2014 ask specific questions that signal \u201cI see what you\u2019re doing there\u201d, says Lowe. Freeholders and managing agents are legally required to account for every penny of service charge money \u2014 you can ask to see receipts.\n\nAn ombudsman is available for low-level complaints, but more serious ones require legal action. And here, the advice is to tread carefully. Legal action would probably have to be disclosed to a buyer, making it harder to move on.\n\nFreeholders can in some cases claim legal costs from leaseholders \u2014 if you sue them, you could end up paying their legal bill as well as your own \u2014 though this is due to change under the reforms. Get legal advice before withholding your service charge, as this may put you in breach of the lease and could mean you end up paying the freeholder\u2019s legal fees personally, or even have your property repossessed.\n\nIf enough of your neighbours are also aggrieved, in some cases you can apply for the \u201cright to manage\u201d, whereby leaseholders take control of block management and the service charge.\n\nBut in the end, all property ownership carries risk, as does renting. What\u2019s important is flushing out the risks, and weighing them against a property\u2019s price, location, size and everything else we consider when buying ourselves a home. As Chick puts it: \u201cNothing can ever be risk-free, but you can go into it with your eyes open.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/dbc9abcf-25bd-415d-9743-40b73b1dfbd7"}}, {"id": "64425390-88da-431f-b132-97e2837a73d8", "event_name": "Luxury brands urge return of UK tax-free tourist shopping", "blurb": "Watch and jewellery companies report double-digit falls in sales to foreign visitors since measure was abolished post-Brexit", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "Watch and jewellery brands have highlighted the impact on business of the removal of tax-free shopping in the UK.\n\nRishi Sunak, then chancellor of the exchequer, scrapped the VAT Retail Export Scheme in Great Britain \u2014 which allowed visitors from outside the EU to reclaim the value added tax on goods bought \u2014 with effect from January 1 2021, following the Brexit transition period.\n\nBusiness leaders have since called for the reinstatement of tax-free shopping, with more than 300 \u2014 including watch and jewellery brand executives \u2014 signing a letter to the current chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in October.\n\n\u201cTourists are feeling completely unwelcome and disincentivised to come shopping in the UK,\u201d says signatory Sophia Hirsh, managing director of Mayfair-based jeweller Hirsh London. \u201cWe deal with a lot of clients that would come normally year on year, sometimes twice a year. They still enjoy coming to London but instead of spending 10 days here, they\u2019ll fly in, take the Eurostar to Paris, do some shopping, come back and fly home \u2014 or fly down to Milan. They\u2019re changing their habits and it\u2019s purely because of the tax-free shopping.\u201d\n\nSales to overseas tourists accounted for 4 per cent of turnover at Hirsh London between February and November 2024, compared with 30 per cent for the whole of 2019, says Hirsh, who attributes the slump to the removal of tax-free shopping. And, four years on from the change in policy, her brand is not alone in reporting a drop in trade to international visitors.\n\nFive per cent of retailer Watches of Switzerland Group\u2019s UK market came from a combination of sales to tourists in its stores and airport outlets at the end of 2024, compared with 33 per cent pre-Brexit, says chief executive Brian Duffy. He says it is UK retailers that \u201chave really lost out\u201d from the removal of tax-free shopping because they have \u201cno beneficial offset\u201d \u2014 unlike the European luxury brands on London\u2019s Bond Street that also have stores in Paris.\n\nAntoine Pin, chief executive of Tag Heuer, says it is difficult to identify the specific impact of the removal of tax-free shopping on the Swiss watchmaker\u2019s UK sales because there are other factors to consider, including the global economic environment, Brexit, and \u201cthe ups and downs of the sector\u201d post Covid. However, he says there has been a \u201cdouble-digit drop\u201d in both footfall and purchases by international tourists compared with 2019.\n\nOver the same period, Tag Heuer has seen an increase in sales to overseas visitors in Paris, Switzerland and Italy, Pin points out. \u201cAgain, you don\u2019t correlate 100 per cent, but you see the expansion of the business out of the UK,\u201d he says. \u201cWe also can trace some of our clients who used to buy in the UK, who are now buying out of the UK.\u201d\n\nPin says some tourists consult the internet on their phones in front of store staff, \u201ccalculating precisely the benefits or the drawbacks of purchasing in the UK\u201d. The \u201ctransit of purchases\u201d to other countries undermines its local investment, he adds.\n\nHirsh says a 19 per cent year-on-year decrease in sales at Hirsh London is partly due to the loss of tax-free shopping, plus a drop in new UK-based clients because they can now shop tax-free in the EU.\n\nFive per cent of tax-free spend in Europe on watches and jewellery between January and September 2024 was by UK shoppers, according to tax-free shopping specialist Global Blue. Customers from the US accounted for 27\u00a0per cent.\n\nGlobal Blue\u2019s Watches & Jewelry Study in October found the average tax-free spend per shopper on these items in Europe was up 38 per cent between January and September 2024, compared with the same period in 2019. The category\u2019s recovery is being driven by the exclusive (average spend \u20ac28,200) and luxury (average \u20ac7,750) segments.\n\nIf there is no change in UK government policy this year, Hirsh says she \u201cwill have no choice but look at other options\u201d to grow her business, including working with overseas stockists for the first time. She is also considering holding events abroad.\n\nWatches of Switzerland has focused its efforts on its domestic market. Similarly, Pin says Tag Heuer has mitigated some of its missed sales opportunities by \u201ctalking more than ever\u201d to local clients and offering experiences, from an in-store product presentation with a glass of champagne to a visit to the manufacture in Switzerland. These, he says, help build stronger relationships between staff and customers \u201cso that, eventually, the price itself is not the major factor\u201d in a purchase decision. Both companies have offered limited edition watches in the UK.\n\nBreitling launched its Superocean Heritage B20 Automatic 42mm limited edition watch in the UK and Ireland last month, having released the limited edition Superocean 44mm and Chronomat 42mm exclusively in the UK earlier in 2024. \u201cLocal special editions have contributed to creating reasons for tourists to buy, while also appealing more broadly by being tailored to the market and produced in limited numbers, adding an element of scarcity,\u201d Gavin Murphy, managing director of Breitling UK, explained in a statement.\n\nWhile the lack of tax-free shopping presents \u201csome obstacles in being competitive with the rest of Europe\u201d, he said the brand, which has 23 regional boutiques, is not entirely reliant on trade from visitors to London.\n\nLast year, the UK\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that the withdrawal of the VAT Retail Export Scheme would save the exchequer \u00a3540mn by 2025-26. However, the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy said that a fully operational scheme could have boosted UK GDP by \u00a311.1bn in 2023.\n\nInternational shoppers can still buy goods tax-free if they have them sent directly to their address outside the UK (and outside the EU if in Northern Ireland), but brands say few take up this option.\n\nHowever, UK jeweller Boodles\u2019 VAT-free export sales (excluding ecommerce) rose from \u00a32mn for the whole of 2019 to \u00a36mn for March-November 2024, according to chair Michael Wainwright, with marketing activity in the US key to the growth. Most of these sales were in store, with the jewels consigned by courier.\u00a0The 2024 figure is, however, a little skewed by a high-price sale to Oman, says Wainwright.\n\nHe says Boodles has been less affected by the removal of tax-free shopping than some brands because it sells predominantly to UK-based clients, but admits sales \u201ccould be absolutely on fire now if there was no such thing as the \u2018tourist tax\u2019\u201d.\n\nHe cannot see policy changing in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, Duffy \u2014 who, like Wainwright, signed the letter to Reeves \u2014 is \u201chopeful\u201d following last year\u2019s change of UK government. \u201cAll we\u2019re asking for, actually, is that the\u00a0government be open to objectively looking at all the facts\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. we believe when they do, they can only come to the same conclusion,\u201d he says. \u201cWe therefore think it\u2019s inevitable that [tax-free shopping] comes back. But it\u2019s a matter of when.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cWe have no plans to introduce a new tax-free shopping scheme in Great Britain.

Bellamy called this increase \u201cunwelcome\u201d as it signalled households were bracing for tough economic times by prioritising savings over spending.\n\nThe UK household saving ratio, the proportion of disposable income that is not spent, was 10.1 per cent in the three months to September, well above the 5.5 average of the 2016-2019 period, according to official statistics. Despite real wages rising for more than one and a half years, household consumption per capita remained 2.2 per cent below its Q4 2019 levels, before the pandemic.\n\nBut Henderson argued that when confidence recovers, double-digit saving rates and healthy wage growth could turn consumption around.\n\n\u201cIf confidence was to pick up, consumers in aggregate have the means to unleash a higher level of consumption,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cThat confidence recovers soon though is less certain.\u201d\n\nHousing affordability has improved, according to separate data published on Friday by Nationwide. It showed that while remaining above long-term average, the price-to-earnings ratio for first-time buyers fell to 5 at the end of last year from a peak of 5.8 in 2022.

The mood among investors towards European countries \u2014 including the UK \u2014 remains relatively gloomy.\n\n\u201cThe outlook is quite bleak for the UK in terms of growth,\u201d said the chief executive of one of the world\u2019s largest pension funds. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Europe is a lot better.

Uncertainty over how it will navigate between the two massive economies it trades with threatens to hang over the economy.\n\nAllies of Reeves were clear that they had made progress during their frenetic round of meetings in Davos. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be months and years of hard work, but we have shifted the dial in the last week and that is what businesses are telling us,\u201d said one. \u201cIt\u2019s not job done on growth but we have made a huge amount of progress.

The \u00a33bn loan is controversial because it would carry an interest rate of 9.75 per cent as well as fees and incentives for the existing Thames Water management.\n\nThe agreement is being challenged by a separate group of Thames Water\u2019s junior creditors \u2014 which have proposed a cheaper deal \u2014 and by environmental campaigners who argue that the company would be better off in special administration.\n\nThe loan would buy the company time to raise at least \u00a33bn of equity in a parallel process.

Thames Water has not yet made a decision whether to appeal Ofwat\u2019s decision to the CMA, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nOfwat has said that Thames will be allowed to raise bills 35 per cent \u2014 much lower than the 59 per cent increase it had sought \u2014 taking average bills from around \u00a3436 now to \u00a3588 between now and 2030.\n\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Thames Water and Ofwat did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\nEY, Teneo and Interpath declined to comment.\n\nIn an update to the market on Wednesday, the company\u2019s chief restructuring officer, Julian Gething, said: \u201cOur plan delivers for customers and stakeholders by unlocking up to \u00a33bn of new money and securing a total of \u00a33.5bn of debt maturity extensions over the next two years and cash releases, so we can continue investing the billions of pounds required to improve our network\u2019s resilience.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is the only implementable solution to enable the equity investment required to provide stability and certainty in the longer term and will not impact customer bills.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s choice of administrator may be complicated by potential conflicts of interest. Teneo is already an adviser to Thames Water and has received \u00a35mn in fees since August 2023. It had also received at least \u00a360mn from running the special administration of collapsed energy supplier Bulb, according to the National Audit Office.\n\nIt has also written a report to the High Court supporting the senior creditors\u2019 \u00a33bn loan, while\u00a0Interpath has written a separate report on behalf of the junior creditors.\n\nSir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at Oxford university, has argued that a SAR would enable Thames Water to focus on a restructuring and on delivering improvements, rather than on negotiating a deal with creditors.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/23bd3059-c569-4d05-9f1e-32cebbd03fa6"}}, {"id": "445b94c9-122c-4248-9593-2bd65ea18d31", "event_name": "Southport killer sentenced to at least 52 years in prison", "blurb": "Judge says \u2018highly likely\u2019 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana will \u2018never be released\u2019 ", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "A teenager has been handed one of the longest jail terms in UK history for the \u201csadistic\u201d and \u201cmeticulously planned\u201d murder of three small children in Southport last July.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 18, was sentenced to life with a minimum of 52 years in prison on Thursday after admitting to the murder of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Da Silva Aguiar, nine, at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class.\n\nHe had also pleaded guilty to 10 attempted murders, as well as possession of an al-Qaeda training manual and the toxic substance ricin.\n\nAfter time already served, the minimum sentence was 51 years and 190 days. Sentencing, Mr Justice Goose said: \u201cIt is highly likely that he will never be released.\u201d\n\nRudakubana is said to have shown no remorse since the attacks six months ago, which prompted riots across the country and questions about how authorities failed to spot multiple warning signs about his behaviour.\n\nLiverpool Crown Court heard that he had gloated about the killings at a police station after his arrest, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing those children are dead\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009so glad\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009so happy.\u201d\n\nThe court heard harrowing details about the attack itself, and that Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time, had planned his rampage for several weeks beforehand.\n\nSix minutes before leaving his house at 11.10am on Monday, July 29, he searched the social media platform X for footage of a terror attack that had taken place in Australia a few months earlier, in which the bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel was stabbed at a church in Sydney.\n\nDoorbell footage then shows him pacing up and down outside his house with his hood up.\n\nArmed with a 20cm kitchen knife, he caught a taxi to the workshop in the Hart Space centre, Southport, where 26 children had gathered to dance, sing and make friendship bracelets.\n\nThe court heard that Rudakubana went upstairs to the class and 30 seconds later began stabbing children wordlessly.\n\nHe stabbed some victims in the back as they tried to escape. Alongside the three murdered children, eight other children and two adults were also injured.\n\nPolice found Rudakubana silently standing over a child\u2019s body on the landing, still holding the kitchen knife he had used to carry out the attack.\n\nLater searches of the house he shared with his parents in Banks, Lancashire, uncovered a machete, a set of arrows, bottles with matches attached, and an Apollo Cerbera knife identical to the one used in the attack. Both knives had been bought on Amazon on July 13, using a virtual private network to encrypt his internet address.\n\nPolice also found a plastic box containing a \u201cpulp\u201d-like substance under his bed. Tests by the UK government laboratory Porton Down confirmed it to be the deadly substance ricin, which he had made in his bedroom.\n\nPolice also seized 43 electronic devices from his home, 32 of which they were able to access.\n\nWhile his internet search history had mostly been deleted, they uncovered more than 164,000 downloaded documents spanning a vast range of extreme violent imagery and information. Subject matter included beheadings, genocides, wars in Iraq, Rwanda, Gaza and Sudan, and images of weapons.\n\nRudakubana had also downloaded an academic paper containing an excerpt from an al-Qaeda training manual.\n\nMr Justice Goose concluded that Rudakubana had followed the instructions it contained in order to carry out the killings.\n\n\u201cI am satisfied that for some time, he had planned to kill as many people as he could,\u201d he said, adding that anyone who had heard the evidence in the case \u201cwould describe what he did as evil\u201d.\n\nMerseyside chief constable Serena Kennedy said the murders had amounted to a \u201csadistic\u201d rampage carried out by a teenager with an \u201cunhealthy fascination with violence\u201d.\n\n\u201cHaving researched atrocities committed by others, the evidence suggests that he set out to emulate them on July 29,\u201d she said, adding that there was no evidence he ascribed to \u201cany particular political or religious ideology\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t fighting for a cause,\u201d she said. \u201cHis only purpose was to kill and he targeted the youngest, most vulnerable in order to spread the greatest level of fear and outrage, which he succeeded in doing.\u201d\n\nRudakubana \u2014 who had been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and had been known to children\u2019s and mental health services, as well as the anti-extremism programme Prevent \u2014 said nothing in formal police interviews.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s hearing Rudakubana shouted over the prosecutor and demanded to see a paramedic.\n\nThe court heard he had stopped eating while on remand. He was taken away for medical checks and did not return to court, after promising to continue disrupting proceedings.\n\nThe attack last July helped to spark a wave of riots across the UK, including in the Merseyside town of Southport itself, after misinformation spread online that the attacker was an illegal immigrant.\n\nRudakubana, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan immigrants, was not charged with an act of terror, although he was convicted of possessing terror-related material. Police and prosecutors said that current legislation did not allow for a terror charge due to Rudakubana\u2019s apparent lack of ideology.\n\nThey said there was no evidence he had been working with others, or of activity in online chats or forums.\n\nHowever, he had been known to the government\u2019s anti-extremism programme Prevent, to whom he was referred three times between 2019 and 2021.\n\nOn the first occasion, in November 2019, he was referred by his school after searching for information on school shootings during an information technology class.\n\nIn February 2021, he was referred after a fellow pupil raised concerns over his Instagram posts about former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi. Two months later he was referred by a teacher who noted he had two tabs open on his computer about the London Bridge terror attacks of 2017.\n\nIn each case, the programme took no further action, noting a lack of overriding ideology.\n\nAhead of the sentencing Vicki Evans, senior national co-ordinator for Counter Terrorism Policing, said the Prevent programme\u2019s understanding of such extremism had still been \u201cevolving\u201d at the time.\n\nEarlier this week Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced a public inquiry into the killings, as well as a review of the Prevent programme.\n\nLancashire police were contacted five times about Rudakubana between 2019 and 2022.\n\nIn March 2022, he went missing and was found by police in possession of a knife. He told officers that he wanted to stab someone and had thought about poisoning people.\n\nRudakubana had also been convicted under the youth justice system after attacking a fellow pupil with a hockey stick in 2019. He had taken a knife into school 10 times previously.\n\nLancashire police said prior to sentencing that it had reviewed each of its call-outs to Rudakubana but could not discuss the details further, due to the forthcoming public inquiry.\n\nIn court, victims and their families read out harrowing accounts of the impact last July\u2019s attack had on their lives.\n\nLeanne Lucas, who had organised the dance class in Southport, was stabbed by Rudakubana and helped many of the children escape.\n\n\u201cAs a 36-year-old woman,\u201d she said, \u201cI cannot walk down the street without holding my breath as I bypass a person and then glance back to see if they\u2019ve attempted to stab me.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/667cd691-79ee-45aa-8002-1ab88cc428ec"}}, {"id": "16a32955-0978-469d-9217-089ce1709916", "event_name": "The UK begins to shift the narrative on growth", "blurb": "Also in this week\u2019s newsletter: why exports are the drivers of economic expansion", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Good afternoon. It\u2019s been hard to know where to look this week, what with the second Trump administration\u2019s opening salvo on taxes and tariffs alongside Rachel Reeves\u2019 increasingly aggressive demands on regulators to deliver growth, but I choose the home front.\n\nThe ousting of Marcus Bokkerink as chair of the Competition and Markets Authority on Tuesday evening \u2014 pour encourager les autres \u2014 was part of a concerted attempt by the government to shift the narrative on growth.\n\nReeves let it be known that growth \u2014 including potentially expanding Gatwick and Luton airports and adding a third runway at Heathrow \u2014 must trump all other priorities, including the drive to net zero.\n\nAt the same time, the government announced the next raft of planning reforms, including establishing a \u2018Nature Restoration Fund\u2019 where developers can pay into a pot for projects that offset the damage caused by developments.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, there are already complaints and objections from this apparently gung-ho approach, including from backbench Labour MPs who are reportedly \u201cholding their heads in despair\u201d at the sight of a Labour chancellor pedalling a Tory narrative on deregulation.\n\nBut I suspect Reeves won\u2019t mind that too much, because there really is a need to change the narrative \u2014 not just of this government, which has had a wretchedly flat-footed beginning, but of the entire post-Brexit period.\n\nTurning the page, telling a story\n\nLast week Labour Together, the party\u2019s in-house think-tank, published a timely report setting out how post-Brexit UK needs to get its mojo back, in a \u201cmore dangerous and competitive world\u201d, as evidenced this week by Trump\u2019s return to the White House.\n\nThe report\u2019s author, Jonathan McClory of strategy firm Sanctuary Counsel, assembled a panel of UK and international diplomats, academics and investors to create a semi-structured focus group to try to identify a new way forward.\n\nEven though none were asked specifically about Brexit, almost all brought it up. This is not about trade barriers, per se, but about the reputational damage caused to the UK as a place to do business and the failure to build a compelling new national narrative outside the EU.\n\nAs one interviewee noted:\n\n\u201cThe chaotic political handling of Brexit has left an impression of a country that doesn\u2019t know what it wants, doesn\u2019t have the capacity to think about its interests, and is consumed by slogans rather than strategy\u201d.\n\nThree other key takeaways: firstly, the UK interviewees were gloomier than the international ones, which tells you that too much self-flagellation over Brexit is counterproductive. As Sir Keir Starmer keeps saying, \u201cwe need to move on\u201d. But it\u2019s actions that matter, not words.\n\nSecondly, that the UK\u2019s future softpower advantage should be centred on \u201cscience, technology, and innovation\u201d \u2014 AI, green technology, bioengineering \u2014 at least as much as traditional cultural advantages.\n\nThis is not to dismiss our traditional values around history \u2014 the UK invented most of the world\u2019s sports, for example \u2014 and we\u2019re good at the flummery that comes with an active royal family. But in this new ground zero world of AI, rampant tech, pandemics and climate change, the argument is that \u201cit\u2019s time to move on\u201d.\n\nAnd thirdly, and most importantly, that the rebirth starts at home. We can tie ourselves in knots over the \u2018EU reset\u2019 and how to handle Donald Trump (\u201cHeaven help us\u201d, as one senior government insider put it to me this week) but the foundations that need fixing first are here.\n\nAs another interviewee said, \u201cThe UK needs to put its domestic affairs in order first,\u201d adding, encouragingly: \u201conce [the UK] manages that, it could really be a leader on many of the areas the global community is struggling with.\u201d\n\nSaying is not doing, but it\u2019s a start\n\nObviously, putting domestic affairs in order is not just about giving speeches in Davos to please corporate investors, but that\u2019s not a bad place to start if you\u2019re trying to stem the tide of relentlessly negative reactions to a Budget that has weighed on hiring and investment.\n\nThe next step is to join the dots. As a reader pointed out after last week\u2019s newsletter, it sends a powerful signal that Angela Rayner overruled the Environment Agency to green-light a Cambridge housing development last December that had been blocked over water scarcity concerns.\n\nBut that needs to be accompanied by an actual plan to reduce water consumption, release finance for a new water pipeline and, ultimately, deliver a new reservoir after a period of 35 years when the UK has failed to build a single one.\n\nAs well as long-term investment, that requires lining up all the strategic regulators, from Ofwat to the Environment Agency and to actually get it done \u2014 and have it seen to be done. Reeves made a start on that this week.\n\nIt also means, for example, that if you\u2019re going to have an industrial strategy that draws talent from all across the world, prevailing on the Home Office to make visas easier and more plentiful \u2014 and daring to make the political argument why this is necessary.\n\nAnd it means, if you\u2019re going to have a \u2018trade strategy\u2019, actually injecting some urgency and ambition into the EU-UK \u2018reset\u2019 (still not too late), which leads to another argument over immigration and the repeated failure of a homegrown skills strategy.\n\nOr it could mean, according to Chris Southworth at the International Chamber of Commerce, taking aggressive steps to remove what he calls the \u201cover zealous regulation\u201d that makes it so difficult for SMEs in particular to obtain trade finance.\n\nSo while there probably isn\u2019t much in the coming EU \u2018reset\u2019 that will fix things for SMEs who\u2019ve been hammered by Brexit, Southworth argues there are steps \u2014 on access to finance and trade digitisation \u2014 that the UK can do at home to get UK companies exporting.\n\nHe\u2019s not convinced that the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority is going far enough to remove barriers that are a legacy of 9/11 and the 2008 financial crash and are stifling the ability of SMEs to obtain low risk, short-term working capital.\n\n\u201cI would have liked to see far more radical and ambitious ideas such as removing capital requirements for SMEs altogether. This would inject far more confidence into the market that the PRA are getting serious on supporting growth,\u201d he says.\n\nMake no mistake, the mood is pretty grim. But as I heard while chairing the annual Executive Survey for MakeUK, the manufacturing body, this morning, it\u2019s far from terminal if the government can build a compelling narrative for Britain.\n\nBusiness is labouring under heavy additional costs as a result of the Budget but as the CEO of medical products maker Vernacare Alex Hodges said, there is also a well of optimism waiting to be tapped \u2014 they just want the government to lean in a bit.\n\nSo I can think of lots of reasons why various growth-enhancing measures (some examples above) won\u2019t happen; but after making such a desperately low-key start to their term in office, ousting a prominent regulator and promising to \u2018build baby, build\u2019 is at least sending a strong signal that you intend to have a serious go at it.\n\nThis week\u2019s chart comes from a thought-provoking report by the Centre for Cities think-tank which maps the link between places engaged in exporting activities and higher wages and productivity.\n\nThe report uses national data to show that exporting activities are the drivers of UK productivity growth, with sectors like IT, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and finance leading growth since 1997.\n\nThis is because exporting activities, particularly in the new industries, have a \u201cgreater ability to absorb new innovations and use creativity to create value\u201d, and also have greater resilience because they can access more markets and ride out cyclical downturns.\n\nThis is the mechanical link between trade and growth. So as the Centre for Cities chief executive Andrew Carter observes, the report highlights the need \u2014 political constraints aside \u2014 to deepen that relationship as far as possible.\n\n\u201cWe clearly need to have the most advantageous relationship and arrangement with Europe as we can possibly get. There\u2019s the difficult politics of that but the further we move away from the best version of an arrangement, the harder it gets,\u201d he says.\n\nFor all that, the government remains committed to a deeply limited EU \u2018reset\u2019 strategy, hemmed in by its red lines on single market and customs union membership.\n\nWe\u2019ll see if the fallout from Trump leads to a pinking of those red lines in a bid to unlock areas that would help attract investment, via improved access to the UK\u2019s largest export market for both people and goods.\n\nWe are now approaching the point, as the agenda is drawn up for the first EU-UK \u2018reset\u2019 summit in March or April this year, when we\u2019ll start to see how ambitious the UK is prepared to be.\n\nEven keeping to the red lines, there are things to be done: the youth mobility deal (which could bleed into elements of professional mobility), full alignment with the EU\u2019s carbon-markets (to reduce carbon border tax friction) and maybe even some fixes on customs.\n\nOne area that is being flirted with in London is the UK joining the Pan-Euro Mediterranean convention. This is a customs agreement between the EU and 20 countries, including several in the Middle East and the Balkans, where all countries share the same \u2018rules of origin\u2019.\n\nFor now, ministers are officially saying that the UK is not interested, but sectoral analysis and some business consultation is ongoing. Trade minister Douglas Alexander left the door open this week by telling MPs that the convention \u201cis an issue that we are open to looking at\u201d and the UK approach would be \u201cpragmatic\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s not a silver bullet and will do nothing to address regulatory frictions. But if you want to understand the possibilities (and some of the trade-offs) then a paper by Anna Jerzewska of the consultancy Trade & Borders, is a really clear piece of work on a tricky subject.

The tax authority has reported that the policy has been linked to at least 10 suicides and 13 attempted suicides.\n\nLabour committed to a new independent review of the loan charge before the general election last year. A previous report by Lord Amyas Morse in 2019 was criticised by MPs and campaigners for involving Treasury and HMRC officials.\n\nMurray said the government had \u201cgone to some lengths\u201d to ensure public confidence in the review, which will run until the summer and be staffed by civil servants who have no connection with or experience working on loan charge policy. They will work in a building separate to the Treasury.\n\nMcCann, a former president of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said he was \u201cpleased to be asked to help find ways\u201d to resolve the dispute.\n\nMcCann previously criticised how HMRC has sought to engage with loan charge campaigners, noting that \u201call the people [within the agency] who are working on loan schemes could be working on customer service\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, the government said the review would probe \u201cthe barriers preventing those subject to the loan charge from reaching resolution with HMRC and recommend ways in which they can be encouraged to do so\u201d.\n\nCampaigners who have demanded a wide-ranging probe \u2014 looking at the role of scheme developers, umbrella companies, recruitment agencies, accountants and tax advisers who recommended the schemes, as well as HMRC \u2014 hit out at the announcement.\n\nSteve Packham, of the Loan Charge Action Group, said the proposed review was \u201ca betrayal\u201d and would \u201cnot resolve the matter\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply worried about the impact on mental health that the announcement of this sham non-review will have,\u201d he added.\n\nMurray said his meetings with loan charge campaigners last year had alerted him to the policy\u2019s impact and that the government wanted the McCann review, to which it will respond by the autumn Budget, to \u201cprovide a way for taxpayers affected to come to a settlement\u201d.\n\nDespite some asking \u201cfor a review with a different scope\u201d, Murray added that his priority was \u201cto help those people who feel stuck\u201d.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/274afe7a-c5aa-409b-89e3-4b2c81f5317b"}}, {"id": "286302aa-b4d4-4560-b46c-f3fa92d8266c", "event_name": "UK competition regulator to cut staff after \u2018budgeting error\u2019", "blurb": "Voluntary exit scheme comes as CMA reels from government\u2019s ousting of its chair", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "The UK Competition and Markets Authority is planning to cut staff numbers by close to 10 per cent following a \u201cbudgeting error\u201d, as the agency reels from the ousting of its chair by the government.\n\nChief executive Sarah Cardell told staff at a town-hall meeting in December that the CMA was starting a voluntary exit scheme to cut staff numbers by about 100 because of an overspend, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nCardell referred to the overspend as a \u201cbudgeting error\u201d, the people said. The CMA has a total headcount of nearly 1,200 and its budget from the Treasury for this year is \u00a3139mn.\n\nAt another town hall meeting on Monday, Cardell said certain areas of the agency, such as mergers and the new digital markets unit, would be protected from the cuts, the people said.\n\nThe watchdog was seeking to avoid forced job cuts by starting with voluntary departures, one of the people added.\n\nThe cuts come as the regulator has found itself in the Labour government\u2019s crosshairs, with CMA chair Marcus Bokkerink ousted this week by ministers after complaints from business about the regulator.\n\nMinisters wanted to send a signal to the CMA and other independent regulators that the government wanted to prioritise growth, according to officials.\n\nBokkerink\u2019s exit has led antitrust lawyers and lobbyists to question whether the CMA will now take a softer approach towards Big Tech.

The biggest story in Westminster this week? The British government has revealed that the Russian spy vessel Yantar had been tracked in the English Channel. (Our story is here.)\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s posts over on his social media network, Truth Social, have raised hopes that he will not, as feared, force Ukraine into a peace deal that leaves Kyiv worse off and Europe\u2019s security at risk.\n\nI\u2019m not going to pretend to be versed either in the ins and outs of naval espionage or Trump\u2019s thinking: but one way or the other all of this further tightens the government\u2019s room for manoeuvre when it comes to fiscal policy. Some more thoughts on that below.\n\nThe future is unwritten, but it is likely that over the next year the British government will have to navigate either a still more acrimonious relationship with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and an unreliable US president. In all likelihood, I think it will face both. It just seems probable that there will be direct consequences for the UK from some kind of disaster that comes out of the Trump presidency. As Janan Ganesh writes in his column this week:\n\nAll of which is going to put further pressure on government spending. I know I am becoming a stuck record on this, but it remains true: the UK has a rising number of old people, which puts upward pressure on health spending. And the UK faces a highly uncertain global backdrop which increases upward pressure on defence spending.\n\nNow, you can also spend money in a smarter way \u2014 over at Reform (the think-tank, not the political party), Rosie Beacon has a smart blog about what the government should be doing on hospital building. And if you modernise and improve the UK\u2019s defence procurement then your money will go further.\n\nBut neither the health nor defence department is going to be able to deliver what it needs to on reform alone. In a terrific column, Chris Giles sets out the big challenge for Rachel Reeves (that the UK hasn\u2019t run a budget surplus for nearly a quarter of a century). There is a reward to be had for the Labour administration if it can demonstrate it has a path to doing so at a time when few governments can. But both the party\u2019s MPs and Labour voters want and expect improvements to public services.\n\nReeves and Keir Starmer hope that \u201cgrowth\u201d can sand off some of those edges, which is part of why the chancellor is making such warm noises about a controversial third runway at the UK\u2019s largest airport. But I think it\u2019s the other way around: we\u2019ve stress tested whether you can meet British voters\u2019 expectations of the state and control public spending through spending cuts. The Labour government must make tough choices on raising income tax on \u201cordinary\u201d taxpayers, and difficult choices on reforming public services to do more with fewer public sector workers (staff being among the biggest of the government\u2019s costs).\n\nReforming planning and trying to shift the balance in how UK regulators balance risk and return are important steps. But such moves on their own are not going to give the government a way out of overseeing a series of difficult budgets if they want to achieve the fiscal consolidation, improved security and a better running NHS that are vital both to their own electoral prospects and to the UK\u2019s hopes of a better tomorrow.\n\nI am really enjoying Joe Hisaishi\u2019s second symphony, which you can listen to here.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f40ee93f-d63f-4f8c-9c6d-d09f8b91f3f4"}}, {"id": "f2ed727c-fbd5-4c8f-9e1d-8426ffcb466b", "event_name": "Rachel Reeves\u2019 offensive against regulators sparks alarm from consumer groups", "blurb": "Chancellor\u2019s pro-business intervention raises concerns that protections are being weakened", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "For a Labour chancellor it was a bold move: Rachel Reeves went to Davos and told an audience of global plutocrats that she wanted to make their lives easier by creating a riskier regulatory environment for UK consumers.\n\nFar away from the Swiss Alps, Reeves\u2019 offensive against regulators was cheered on by right-wing Conservatives, but some Labour MPs despaired that their chancellor\u2019s quest for growth was taking the party into dangerous territory.\n\n\u201cPeople are holding their heads in disbelief,\u201d said one senior Labour MP.\n\nReeves, speaking at the World Economic Forum, was adamant: \u201cYou have got to get the balance right.

You have got to be able to protect consumers but people should be able to take risks as well.\u201d\n\nMarcus Bokkerink, chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, on Tuesday became the highest-profile casualty of Reeves\u2019 new approach, as ministers forced him out of his job over his allegedly lukewarm appetite for growth-focused reforms.\n\nHis sacking was intended to serve as a warning to other regulators, according to government officials. This month, Reeves demanded that 17 watchdogs produce action plans to boost growth and has warned them she will be watching.\n\nJohn McDonnell, former Labour shadow chancellor, said Reeves could hand a propaganda victory to Nigel Farage, leader of the populist Reform UK party, if she aggressively pursued her agenda at the expense of consumers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m becoming increasingly worried that this will all provide our opponents, in particular Reform, the opportunity to portray the Labour party as defending corporate abuse and profiteers,\u201d he said.\n\nReeves\u2019 efforts to protect business from what is seen in government circles as a damaging \u201ccompensation culture\u201d has taken many forms in recent months, with a common theme: less money for allegedly wronged consumers.\n\nThis week, Reeves sought to intervene in a Supreme Court case to shield banks and other car loan providers from multibillion-pound payouts in a landmark mis-selling case, arguing that it would \u201cadversely affect the UK\u2019s reputation as a place to do business\u201d.\n\nLast year, the Treasury successfully put pressure on regulators to slash a proposed compensation limit for victims of payment fraud from \u00a3415,000 to \u00a385,000, amid fears the new regime could seriously damage some fintech companies.\n\nReeves has also pushed for a review of the Financial Ombudsman Service to prevent more mass consumer compensation events, such as the \u00a350bn paid out by banks over the payment protection insurance scandal.\n\nThe Conservatives find themselves in a curious position, egging Reeves on to push further with an agenda that began in 2023 under Rishi Sunak, when regulators were given a \u201csecondary objective\u201d to promote economic growth and competitiveness.\n\nAndrew Griffith, shadow business secretary, wants to see a broader clearout of regulators and has been a critic of the Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog. He thought sacking Bokkerink was \u201ca curious place to start\u201d.\n\nBim Afolami, former Tory City minister, said: \u201cThe chancellor is doing exactly the right thing on the regulators. My advice to her is to keep going.\u201d Another former Tory Treasury minister said simply: \u201cI think she is probably right.\u201d\n\nBut Conservatives also believe Reeves, presiding over a stagnant economy, is using regulators as a scapegoat. Harriett Baldwin, a senior Tory, said the chancellor should \u201cacknowledge some of her own mistakes rather than blaming everyone else\u201d.\n\nGiven that Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s government is in the process of introducing a wave of employment regulation, many business leaders agree with the Tory critique that deregulation should start closer to Number 10. Ministers may yet water down that package.\n\nRegulators say that in return for focusing on growth, Reeves has given a clear signal she will stand by regulators when things go wrong \u2014 as they inevitably will. \u201cWe feel she has our backs now,\u201d said one.\n\nNikhil Rathi, FCA chief executive, told the House of Lords on Wednesday that proposed rule changes \u2014 such as easing controls on mortgage lending \u2014 could lead to more defaults. \u201cOne or two things are going to go wrong here,\u201d he said, arguing that parliament should give the watchdog a \u201cmetric of tolerable failure\u201d.\n\nConsumer groups have expressed alarm. \u201cThe combination of anti-regulation rhetoric \u2014 and now the firing of the CMA chair \u2014 signals to consumers that the government stands ready to peel back the protections that were built for them,\u201d said James Daley, head of the Fairer Finance research group.\n\nRocio Concha, a director at consumer group Which?, said the government was \u201cabsolutely right\u201d to focus on growth and the role of regulators. But she added: \u201cStrong consumer protections are not an impediment to growth. They are vital for economic growth because they help to create level playing fields for dynamic\u00a0competition, while ensuring consumers are protected\u00a0from being ripped off.\u201d\n\nProfessor John Thanassoulis of Warwick Business School, who is also an independent CMA panel member, said the government should \u201cresist the temptation to beat up on the CMA\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt will not drive marketwide productivity growth.

On 16 January, supermarket Morrisons was granted a High Court injunction to block further protests.\n\nPrior to the October Budget, farm campaign groups slammed supermarkets for squeezing their margins with low food prices and undercutting them by not backing homegrown produce.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Office for Budget Responsibility released a short costing of the IHT policy, estimating that it would raise an extra \u00a3500mn for the Treasury annually between 2027 and 2029, in line with the government\u2019s estimates.\n\nBut the fiscal watchdog noted that receipts would probably taper off after seven years as farmers increasingly gifted their properties to children and modified their tax planning strategies.\n\nThe OBR also suggested that it would be \u201cmore difficult for some older individuals to quickly restructure their affairs\u201d in terms of inheritance planning to adjust to the new measures.\n\nVictoria Atkins, Conservative shadow environment secretary, said the government had \u201cchosen to destroy British family farming for little return. The OBR is clear that it will be near impossible for older farmers to restructure their affairs quickly in response to this vindictive tax.\u201d\n\nFarmers say the sector was struggling with the pressures of climate change, real-term cuts to subsidies, high inflation, wafer-thin margins and the prospect of increased competition as the UK strikes post-Brexit trade deals before chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the IHT changes.\n\nThe exemption was introduced in the 1980s to allow farms to remain in the same family after the death of an owner, a trend that many have warned will become much harder. However, it has helped push up the price of fields as wealthy individuals have bought agricultural land as a form of legal tax avoidance.\n\nFarmers looking to pass on their estate, and their spouses, are each eligible for \u00a31mn of relief before they start paying IHT on their land, on top of the usual inheritance allowances.\n\nGiven that couples already enjoy a threshold of \u00a31mn on their estates that means that two spouses would enjoy a threshold nearer to \u00a33mn, officials have noted.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cOur reform to agricultural and business property reliefs will mean estates will pay a reduced effective inheritance tax rate of 20%, rather than standard 40%, and payments can be spread over 10 years, interest free.\n\n\u201cThis is a fair and balanced approach, which fixes the public services we all rely on, affecting around 500 estates next year.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/db76df80-de96-4799-ab67-43983733badb"}}, {"id": "3bb2e452-f7fa-4efe-907d-d08b65485bda", "event_name": "If the UK wants to lead in AI, it must fund more PhDs", "blurb": "Universities are the cornerstone of the country\u2019s reputation as a global research hub but the business model is in crisis", "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is an honorary professor at UCL and former CEO of Digital Catapult\n\nThere has been much excitement at the UK government\u2019s plan to invest in artificial intelligence. The country\u2019s reputation as a global research and talent developer is proof of the immense contributions made by our leading universities. However, recent economic and social changes have put the business model of universities in crisis. This threatens their ability to maintain the country\u2019s reputation for developing AI pioneers such as Alex Kendall of Wayve and Sir Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind.\n\nFunding PhDs is a cornerstone of our track record. Unfortunately, PhD students with UK Research and Innovation funding in the UK fell under the previous government from 6,835 in 2018-19 to 4,900 in 2022-23, according to Times Higher Education.\n\nThe flow of gifted researchers from around the world is a key revenue driver for our leading research universities. For one thing, UK universities are heavily reliant on these students to deliver teaching. The average stipend for a UK PhD student is around \u00a320,000. These low-paid PhD candidates therefore bring enormous value to the UK. Quite simply, without a healthy PhD student population in this country, our capacity to deliver university teaching and carry out research will collapse.\n\nBetter still, talented PhD students and their start-ups are the hunting ground of global technology companies, attracting investment into the UK. The research that these individuals deliver under the tutelage of established academics is producing the foundational algorithms that play a key role in the global AI revolution.\n\nIf that hunting ground dries up because the flow of PhD students declines, big global tech players will look elsewhere. International academics will give up and move abroad. The economic value of our universities will decline in turn.\n\nThis is a challenge that UK universities have been facing since Brexit, which reduced the number of international students from the EU, and the previous government\u2019s* lack of industrial strategy.\n\nThe truth is that the business model of universities is poorly understood by many in government, even those who fund the sector. The majority of the population tends to only think about universities as places that teach undergraduates. But the engine of their innovation, growth and value lies in the work that is delivered by postgraduates, both PhDs and postdoctoral researchers.\n\nThese two areas are rarely examined together. Their funding is divided. The Office for Students is an independent non-departmental public body that reports to the Department for Education. It manages the viability of undergraduate teaching programmes and certifies degree-awarding powers in England. It also distributes an average annual budget of about \u00a31bn in grants. But research, development and innovation are funded by UKRI, a separate body overseen by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. Because they are split apart, it has been rare for anyone in government to look at the whole model.\n\nToo often the disbursement of PhD funding is driven by the politics of levelling up \u2014 redistributing funds to underperforming and neglected regions. This leaves the powerhouses of research and innovation that have brought significant economic benefit to the UK struggling to remain viable. Indeed, the whole innovation landscape is littered with different kinds of institutions attempting to collaborate despite various layers of regulation and governance policies that in effect keep them apart.\n\nGovernment tech adviser Matt Clifford\u2019s excellent AI action plan references many of the technology\u2019s opportunities for the country. But if we really want to build an AI growth programme for the UK over the long term, then we need to realise that the UK university business model is in urgent need of reform.\n\nWe can learn much from the way in which US universities such as MIT and Stanford fund their PhD programmes by encouraging greater numbers of external funders to offer scholarships and support. We also need to streamline the academic pipeline from research to development to innovation so that all those involved \u2014 from universities to technology centres known as \u201ccatapults\u201d to start-ups to major industry \u2014 work together and not in competition.\n\nIf the UK is to capitalise on its existing institutions, we need a root-and-branch examination of PhD funding, including whether the current agencies are optimal for disbursing precious government resources.

The others were Ed Miliband, Steve Reed, Lisa Nandy, Darren Jones, Anneliese Dodds and Hilary Benn.\n\nMiliband, who is now climate change secretary, threatened to resign over the issue during Gordon Brown\u2019s government, while London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan is still opposed.\n\nCritics argue airport expansion is incompatible with the UK\u2019s legally binding target to reach net zero carbon emissions, given that aviation is one of the most difficult industries to decarbonise.\n\nDowning Street said this week that it still required a third runway at Heathrow to meet its four tests on carbon emissions, noise, air quality and growth. The issues of local noise and air pollution are considered by experts to be the hardest to meet on the congested west London site.\n\nMeanwhile Reeves, who spent Wednesday meeting bankers and investors in Davos, repeated her backing for aggressive deregulation and the need to clear the way for more building.\n\n\u201cThere is always a reason not to invest, not to build,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are bats and newts.

The Supreme Court in April will decide whether lenders should be on the hook for tens of billions of pounds in compensation for historic loan agreements, which they thought to be legal at the time.\n\nThat would spook investors, not least because it is only five years since the saga of mis-sold payment protection insurance ended up costing more than 10 times initial estimates. One \u00a350bn bill could be seen as an aberration, but two in quick succession may start to look like a worrying trend. Even in heavily regulated sectors such as financial services, investors should be able to expect some level of consistency and predictability around the rules.\n\nBanks, too, can argue that they need predictability in order to lend money. Most restarted lending a few days after the October ruling plunged the industry into confusion. But it is difficult to make long-term investment decisions if you live in fear that policies currently considered standard will be retrospectively punished 10 years down the road.\n\nReeves is hardly alone in worrying that squeezing banks too hard could hurt the economy. American lenders squealed after regulators proposed a package of tough new rules known as Basel III, arguing that they would be forced to tighten the lending spigots.\n\nUK banks are still pricing in a hefty slug of risk.

As the cost of its borrowing has risen since the autumn, the chances of meeting its main self-imposed fiscal rule \u2014 to borrow only for investment by the end of the decade \u2014 have dwindled. The setback has been met with fierce rhetoric from the government. Whether from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves, his chancellor, or their spokespeople, the adjectives to describe the fiscal rules have tended to shuffle between \u201cironclad\u201d and \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d. Their attitude is always \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d.\n\nSentiment has improved in UK government bond markets over the past week, but many are yet to be convinced. Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of hedge fund firm Bridgewater Associates, is less than impressed, saying that gilts could be heading for a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d. Of course, this was overblown, but his comments reflect a broader concern in financial markets that a gap exists between tough fiscal rhetoric and the reality of UK budgetary policy \u2014 and it far precedes the current Labour government.\n\nWhat is needed to provide the budgetary stability on which the rest of the UK economy can build is therefore simple. No more rhetoric. No more announcements of tighter fiscal policy either now or some time in the future. Instead, Reeves needs to implement the tax increases and spending plans outlined in October without any compromise on when they are due to come into force in April.\n\nThese are sizeable. Along with the large and messy increase in employers\u2019 national insurance, there are continued income tax rises in the form of frozen allowances and far from lavish public expenditure increases. Together, the measures are set to reduce government borrowing significantly. The overall deficit is forecast to fall from 4.5 per cent of GDP in 2024-25 to 3.6 per cent in 2025-26, while the current budget deficit, excluding capital investment, is set to halve from 2 per cent of GDP to 0.9 per cent over the same period.\n\nThis will be an exercise in show, not tell. Reducing borrowing by this much is reasonably rare for UK governments \u2014 it will become clear by the summer whether Reeves and her policies are on track. Success would immediately demonstrate a difference between UK fiscal policy and that of similar countries.\n\nIn recent years, US administrations have shown no ability to run a deficit much under 6 per cent of GDP, and there\u2019s no improvement in sight. The European Commission expects the French budget deficit to have exceeded 6 per cent of GDP last year, with little prospect of a political agreement to deliver much improvement. Underlying German public finances are strong, but its economy is weak. And debt levels in the UK, though high, are still far lower than those in Italy.\n\nBond markets often have a mind of their own, but it would be difficult to single out the UK for special punishment if it is the one decent-sized advanced country with the ability to pass legislation to impose fiscal consolidation and actually see it through. This is what Reeves must do. If growth suffers, the Bank of England would be in a strong position to ease monetary policy and offset the fiscal tightening.\n\nThere are no guarantees in the business of persuading financial markets that they have more to lose if they bet against you. The UK government must also hope that consumers begin to spend their recent real income gains and improve growth. It needs to demonstrate that any expansion will come with some recovery in productivity growth. And that the increases in employers\u2019 national insurance must not have a much more damaging impact on jobs and prices than already expected.\n\nNone will be achieved with more speeches about non-negotiable commitments to ironclad fiscal rules.\n\nchris.giles@ft.com", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0266c1f4-5757-4077-875a-1b7536c15d4a"}}, {"id": "1f51b4f8-0a3e-409e-ba35-2fb4dd9c713a", "event_name": "Ousting of CMA chair prompts warnings of interference in UK regulation", "blurb": "Move was part of Labour government\u2019s drive to remove obstacles to economic growth", "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Antitrust lawyers have questioned the \u201cextraordinary\u201d decision by ministers to force out the chair of Britain\u2019s competition watchdog, suggesting that it could have a \u201cchilling\u201d effect on other UK regulators.\n\nThe government confirmed the departure of Marcus Bokkerink as chair of the Competition and Markets Authority on Tuesday evening, after the Financial Times reported that business secretary Jonathan Reynolds had intervened.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves, speaking to Bloomberg in Davos on Tuesday, implicitly criticised Bokkerink: \u201cHe recognised it was time for him to move on and make way for somebody who does share the mission and the strategic direction this government are taking.\u201d\n\nThis month, ministers ordered 17 of Britain\u2019s biggest regulators to set out how they intend to help boost UK economic growth. Stephen Phipson, head of manufacturing lobbying group Make UK, on Wednesday applauded the government\u2019s efforts to make regulation \u201cfit for purpose\u201d.\n\nBut a number of lawyers and lobbyists said Bokkerink\u2019s resignation had come out of the blue.\n\n\u201cTo be honest it was a bit of a surprise,\u201d said one business lobbyist. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in lots of discussions with the CMA\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. and they seemed to be really getting it and making changes.\u201d\n\nOne antitrust lawyer at a London firm said the move would have a \u201cchilling and intimidating effect\u201d on independent regulators across the country.\n\n\u201cAlthough in the short term it seems reassuring for business, if competition policy is at the mercy of political fashion it becomes less stable and predictable, which undermines business confidence,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cIt is an extraordinary move by the government to interfere so much in a competition authority,\u201d they added.\n\nBokkerink\u2019s departure raises questions over whether ministers are prioritising the demands of big business over competing priorities such as consumer rights and the environment.\n\nThe government has appointed as new interim CMA chair Doug Gurr, who ran Amazon\u2019s UK business during the company\u2019s tussle with the CMA over its minority investment in Deliveroo, which the regulator ultimately approved in 2020.\n\nOne person said the forced exit looked like a \u201cdesperate move from a struggling government\u201d that was trying to win back popularity with business leaders after imposing extra regulations and taxes on corporations in last year\u2019s Budget.\n\nThe move has also led to speculation about the fate of the CMA\u2019s chief executive Sarah Cardell and whether she may also be replaced.\n\nAndrew Griffith, shadow business secretary, told the House of Commons on Wednesday that the Conservative party wanted regulatory reform so businesses \u201ccarry less deadweight\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut dismissing the non-executive part-time chairman of the CMA seems a curious place to start,\u201d he told the House of Commons. \u201cHe\u2019s not responsible for day-to-day decision making at the CMA. That\u2019s the job of the chief executive. Did they aim and miss?\u201d\n\nCardell has been at pains in recent weeks to emphasise that the regulator is taking the government\u2019s growth mandate seriously. In November, Cardell told the FT the agency was planning a review of its merger remedies, signalling more mergers could be approved based on undertakings such as price freezes rather than forcing the divestiture of assets.\n\nOne person familiar with the matter said Cardell had \u201cpositive discussions\u201d about her role with ministers since Bokkerink\u2019s resignation\u201d.\n\nMax von Thun, Europe director at the Open Markets Institute, said the CMA had been at the forefront of global efforts to push back against rising market concentration, particularly in the \u201cmonopolistic\u201d tech sector.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s decision to replace the authority\u2019s chair with a former Amazon executive, at a time when a handful of US tech giants are tightening their grip over the future of artificial intelligence, is a major strategic blunder,\u201d he said.\n\nLawyers and competition specialists noted that Clare Barclay, until recently Microsoft UK head and now in another senior role at the company, is chairing the government\u2019s new Industrial Strategy Advisory Council.\n\nIn a two-page statement released on Tuesday night, Bokkerink said he had helped to refocus the CMA to ensure it delivered on empowering \u201cconsumers and effective competition \u2014 instead of being held back by a few powerful incumbents setting the rules for everyone else\u201d.\n\nBusiness groups welcomed the government\u2019s intervention. Craig Beaumont, executive director at the Federation of Small Businesses, said he hoped the CMA \u201cwill now do more on growth\u201d. One banker said the CMA had been seen as an obstacle and the ousting of Bokkerink could be a way to send a message to the regulator\u2019s staff.\n\nHis exit comes as the CMA has been handed new powers to regulate digital markets.\n\nIt announced last week that Google would be the first company the watchdog would investigate to decide if the tech giant warranted a special market status in light of its position in search services, which could see it bound by tougher conduct rules.\n\nThe government is due to issue a \u201cstrategic steer\u201d to the CMA in the coming weeks, setting out its priorities for the regulator. However, beyond its desire for the watchdog to focus on growth, it was unclear what Labour actually wanted the CMA to do, lawyers said.\n\n\u201cThe government is obviously unhappy with the CMA but doesn\u2019t seem to have concrete views on what\u2019s wrong,\u201d said one senior antitrust lawyer.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ivan Levingston", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/976ca0e3-b47b-44c4-9583-a3fcdd713283"}}, {"id": "a2c0a217-29f3-4362-934e-dda4bb7c461d", "event_name": "Russian spy ship found \u2018gathering intelligence\u2019 in UK waters", "blurb": "Defence minister tells Moscow Britain will not shy away from \u2018robust action\u2019 amid fears of potential sabotage of undersea cables", "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Britain\u2019s defence minister warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that \u201cwe will not shy away from robust action\u201d after telling parliament that a Russian spy vessel had been operating in UK waters for the second time since November.\n\nJohn Healey said the Russian spy ship, Yantar, had been tracked in the English Channel by a warship after loitering over critical undersea infrastructure.

However, HM Revenue & Customs\u2019 guidance suggests people who trade second-hand items through online selling services may need to pay tax and register for self-assessment. How much tax will I need to pay if I continue to sell unwanted items online, and is it worth it?\n\nZena Hanks, private wealth partner at Saffery, says online platforms will soon start sharing sales information and the personal data of its users with HMRC. If an individual has sold a certain number of items, generated sales of \u00a31,700 or more, or provided a paid-for service on a website or an app in 2024, they will be contacted by the platform in advance of their personal details and sales information being shared with HMRC. The principles of whether the sale of items or the provision of paid-for services is taxable remains unchanged.\n\nThe sharing of information is a move towards more transparency for the online platforms and underpins HMRC\u2019s efforts to tackle what it perceives to be a tax gap. With that in mind we need to be clear what does and what does not need to be reported to HMRC.\n\nGetting some money back for items no longer needed as part of a declutter is unlikely to qualify as an activity that generates a tax liability for two reasons. Under first principles there is likely to be a cost associated with the original acquisition of the item which would be taken into account when working out if any tax is due. In addition there needs to be an intention to make a profit. In the situation described here there is no suggestion that the sale is being motivated by a profit and it is likely the items sold would not generate sufficient proceeds to generate an overall profit.\n\nYou do however need to report sale activities when you are selling assets at a profit \u2014 for example you upcycle furniture, or you source clothes or furniture to sell on at a profit, or if you sell any personal possessions for more than \u00a36,000. There is a reporting requirement if you provide paid-for services for example garden maintenance, dog walking, taxi driving, delivering food. In addition, income and free products received from social influencing may also generate a taxable activity \u2014 all of this depends on the numbers involved. If there is sufficient activity and income, that may generate an obligation to report the income details to HMRC and any associated tax will need to be paid.\n\nThe rules on how to tax trading activities haven\u2019t changed and that includes the availability of the \u00a31,000 trading allowance. What has changed is that online platforms are being compelled to provide sales information and the associated sellers\u2019 personal information to HMRC. It is that information that HMRC will use to ensure that those generating income are paying the correct amount of tax. If you are in any doubt you should speak to a professional adviser as soon as possible. If income does need to be reported it is always better that an \u201cunprompted\u201d disclosure is provided to HMRC.\n\nThe management at the local golf club where my student son works part-time have told him that they are struggling to remain profitable, so they will not be replacing anyone who leaves. To ensure that my son keeps his job, could he offer to work as a self-employed contractor who invoices the golf club for hours worked?\n\nRachel Roberts, a partner in the employment and immigration team HCR Law, says the option of offering to work as a self-employed contractor may seem like a good solution but there are key considerations that your son may want to think about. First, and most important, it would not be possible for your son simply to switch from being a part-time employee to self-employed if, in practice, the nature of his role and his duties remain the same.\n\nWhile your son and the club could agree to change the label of his employment, there is a real risk that HMRC would challenge this. HMRC would apply a variety of tests to determine if your son is providing his services as an employee under the \u201cdisguise\u201d of self-employment.\n\nThe key difference between whether your son will be treated as a self-employed contractor or an employee is the degree of control the club has over him. For example, if your son is unable to choose his working hours, work for other businesses or appoint someone else to provide the services on his behalf, then there is a high probability that he will be treated by HMRC as an employee. This could have tax implications as HMRC could serve a demand for backdated PAYE and national insurance payments.\n\nEven if your son\u2019s work does meet the criteria needed to be deemed as self-employment, he will need to bear in mind that self-employed contractors accept a higher level of financial risk. Your son would be responsible for filing his own tax returns. There is also a risk of personal liability if your son provides his services directly to the club rather than through an intermediary, such as a limited company.\n\nAnother key consideration is that your son would be offering to give up his employment rights. Self-employed contractors are not afforded the same employment rights as employees. For example, your son would not be eligible for sick pay or holiday pay. The golf club could also terminate any contractual agreement with your son on relatively short notice if his services are not needed.\n\nAt this stage, it might be premature for your son to initiate discussions about working on a self-employed basis, particularly if his sole aim is to keep his job. The good news is that the club is considering alternative options to dismissal, such as freezing recruitment (as you have mentioned).\n\nIf the situation worsens, the club could consider other cost-cutting measures, such as reducing the number of working hours or shifts and possibly even reducing the rate of pay. Depending on how long your son has worked for the club, he could be entitled to a statutory redundancy payment if his role is terminated.\n\nThe opinions in this column are intended for general information purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice.

Heck of a scoop from Jim Pickard and Suzi Ring last night: government ministers have forced the resignation of Marcus Bokkerink as chair of the Competition and Markets Authority. Doug Gurr was appointed as the CMA\u2019s new interim chair.\n\nI think this is good news for the UK. It\u2019s bad news for readers because it means today\u2019s newsletter features some perhaps excessive detail about how the UK positions itself as \u201copen for business\u201d and the video game industry more broadly.\n\nOne of the more damaging decisions taken in the last parliament was the CMA\u2019s decision to block Microsoft\u2019s $75bn acquisition of video-games maker Activision Blizzard. (The regulator approved a revised Microsoft-Activision deal in October 2023.)\n\nThe \u201cconsole wars\u201d are an old, old feature of the gaming industry: manufacturers of gaming consoles such as Sony and Microsoft compete for sales by buying and developing exclusive titles for their platforms. It\u2019s part of what encourages video games companies to innovate, both in terms of the hardware of their consoles and the software that runs on it.\n\nThere simply isn\u2019t a god-given right to be able to play Call of Duty on the PlayStation 5 and there is no evidence that the gaming industry will or would have become overly consolidated had future versions of Call of Duty (the jewel in Activision Blizzard\u2019s crown) become exclusive to Microsoft\u2019s X-Box console. Indeed, Microsoft\u2019s whole strategy has been to move away from console exclusives anyway. Phil Spencer, chief executive of Microsoft Gaming, recently hinted to Bloomberg that many of X-Box\u2019s exclusives could expand to PlayStation.\n\nThe CMA\u2019s rationale for blocking the deal relied on assumptions about the spread and ubiquity of cloud-based gaming that went beyond anything dreamt of in the sector. The regulator seemed to base its case on wild and unexpected changes both in how consumers choose video games and consoles and how Microsoft tries to make a profit from gaming.\n\nTo make matters worse, it meant that the UK\u2019s regulator went further than the EU or the US, despite being a much smaller market. Reactions to it in the UK\u2019s tech sector ranged from \u201cfrustrated\u201d to \u201cenraged\u201d.\n\nThat isn\u2019t necessarily the fault of its chair, but in making a change at the top, the government has an opportunity to prove that its rhetorical commitment to growth is matched by a serious commitment to getting the right people in place.\n\nI was at The Vicious Circle last night, a brilliant new exhibition to mark this year\u2019s Holocaust Memorial Day.

Yields move inversely to prices.\n\nPooja Kumra, a strategist at TD Securities, said the sharp increase in borrowing last month added to the fiscal strains, but that many investors already believed the chancellor would have to either cut spending or raise taxes to ensure she meets her fiscal rule.\n\nSterling, which was swept up in the gilt sell-off this month, was flat at $1.235.\n\nIn a sign of the strain on public finances from higher inflation, interest costs were \u00a38.3bn in December, \u00a33.8bn higher than a year earlier and the third-highest December figure since monthly records began. A \u00a31.7bn payment for the repurchase of military dwellings added to December\u2019s borrowing.\n\nTax receipts in the month rose \u00a34bn from December 2023 to \u00a365.5bn. Public sector debt, or borrowing accumulated over time, was 97.2 per cent of GDP, remaining at levels last seen in the early 1960s.\n\nElliott Jordan-Doak, economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cWe expect the government to outline spending reductions \u2014 backloaded towards the end of the forecast year \u2014 at the next fiscal event in March.

Big Four firms PwC, author of Women in Work, and EY, behind European Financial Services Boardroom Monitor, are on track to flunk their own targets for women partners in the UK.\n\nLuckily, there\u2019s a PowerPoint presentation to address this shortcoming. First up: it\u2019s not just them and it\u2019s not just women. Companies across the globe are rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion goals, bowing to a new legal backdrop and zeitgeist. In the US these include retailer Walmart, burger joint McDonald\u2019s, social media giant Meta and PwC.\n\nAs for women, fewer were granted new S&P 500 board positions last year: 42 per cent versus 46 per cent the previous year, according to executive search firm Spencer Stuart. None self-identified as non-binary.\n\nSlide two: read the small print. This trend was reversed in the UK. In the top 150 boardrooms, 43 per cent of directors are women, up from the year-ago 40 per cent. Drill down to executive level, though, and the proportion shrinks to less than half that.\n\nSlide three repurposes the same one used in presentations on renewables, AI and pretty much everything else: these things take time. When Norway launched its quota, the same group of qualified women \u2014 the so-called golden skirts \u2014 presided over multiple portfolios of non-exec directorships.\n\nBuilding a pipeline of talent takes time and many women are felled at the first hurdle. Despite making up nearly half of the US workforce, female participation falls to 39 per cent at managerial level. For directors it\u2019s 37 per cent, and just 29 per cent in the C-suite, finds McKinsey.\n\nAbsent in the consultant\u2019s PowerPoint, though, is more meaningful data. Splitting workers by parallel caregiving roles, rather than anatomically, is more logical \u2014 not least in professional services, where taking a couple of years out to start a family can knock you back several more rungs on the partnership ladder.\n\nPew Research took a stab at this using 2022 data. In typical small-children-at-home years, aged 35-44, 94 per cent of fathers were active workers versus 75 per cent for mothers.\u00a0That gap shrinks to a third the size when considering child-free respondents \u2014 implying concomitant salary and promotion gaps. Some research goes further, suggesting younger women \u2014 potential mothers \u2014 suffer the \u201cmaybe baby\u201d career handicap regardless of whether or not said baby materialises.\n\nThat leaves two takeaways for the Big Four: get women partner goals back on track, and task the interns with harvesting more useful data sets.\n\nlouise.lucas@ft.com", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a30dc1d9-3794-4ebc-9148-94b7f88e111c"}}, {"id": "71da075b-1aa6-49ad-a2f0-1de0f1618d9f", "event_name": "Mews on: the premium of glamorous infamy and secret tranquillity", "blurb": "Once the stuff of crime thrillers and haunts of secret agents, these storied homes tucked down cobblestone streets continue to have an idiosyncratic allure", "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Beginning life in the shadow of London\u2019s grandest houses, mews properties are a peculiarly British phenomenon. Tucked away, these cobbled streets of low-slung terraces continue to offer up surprises.\n\nAs stabling for the upper classes, the modest buildings were designed for discreet access. In time, they became the haunts of the nefarious rather than the equestrian \u2014 and gained a whiff of notoriety that they haven\u2019t completely shaken.\n\nFictional depictions of mews trade heavily on their air of secrecy. They are particularly associated with crime thrillers, from the foggy pursuits of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson across the cobbles of Marylebone to Agatha Christie\u2019s 1937 story \u201cMurder in the Mews\u201d.\n\nWith Wimpole Mews making headlines for its role in the Profumo affair in the 1960s, mews became associated with secret agents. In the same decade, Mayfair\u2019s Upper Berkeley Mews (a fictional conflation of two real addresses) was a natural fit for the debonair vigilante character of Simon Templar of the TV series The Saint, who lived in an \u201cingeniously comfortable fortress\u201d of converted garages. Fifty years later mews\u2019 association with well-heeled mavericks continued with Colin Firth\u2019s character in Kingsman: The Secret Service.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s this slightly glamorous sense of infamy that has long attracted musicians and actors, from Madonna to Michael Caine. \u201cThey\u2019ve always attracted the creative and the unconventional,\u201d says Edward Thomson of estate agent Strutt & Parker. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe how private and peaceful a mews can be, amid the hustle and bustle of London.\u201d\n\nFor Istanbul-born Damla Tuncel and her husband Alexander, a New Yorker, this sense of tranquillity was a key factor in their decision to buy a mews house. The couple spent two years looking for the perfect one, which they found in South Kensington\u2019s Princes Gate Mews last summer.\n\n\u201cWe wanted something [that felt] more like a house than our Earl\u2019s Court flat,\u201d says Damla, a portfolio manager at Wellington Management. \u201cAt the viewing, residents were watering each other\u2019s flower pots, children playing on the cobbled street; we glimpsed a camaraderie that we\u2019d never had in London.\u201d The sociability of such narrow streets, often cul-de-sacs, is a major attraction for some buyers, concurs Peggy Lurot, of specialist mews estate agents Lurot Brand.\n\nAlthough they tend to lack private gardens, many mews buildings have verdant pockets outside their front door, adding to their cottage-like ambience. This, along with their sociability, means mews command a premium, says Lurot. Over the past decade, mews have retained more of their value than other types of property in prime central London \u2014 all of which have fallen, according to Savills Research.\n\nThe average selling price of a mews property in prime London in the fourth quarter of 2024 was \u00a32.89mn, according to Savills \u2014 when priced per square foot, that\u2019s \u00a31,570; lower than houses (\u00a31,830) and flats (\u00a31,760). Maida Vale and neighbouring W2 (including Paddington and Bayswater) are good places to find homes in a lower price bracket: \u00a31mn-\u00a31.5mn, according to Lurot Brand.\n\nElegant arches bookend many mews streets, heightening the sense of entry into an exclusive domain. The best-preserved mews are protected by Conservation Area status, and some are listed. Martyn John Brown, a chartered surveyor who runs the Everchanging Mews website, picks out South Kensington\u2019s Kynance Mews \u2014 often pictured with its Virginia creeper-clad arch and tumbling wisteria \u2014 and Holland Park Mews as being two of the best examples.\n\nThe relative functionality of mews makes them attractive to wealthy downsizers. Caroline, who preferred not to disclose her full name, and her husband recently bought a three-bedroom mews property in South Kensington, for this reason: \u201cAfter our three children moved out of our town house in Westminster, we wanted lower maintenance and fewer stairs. We spend a lot of time abroad and having a garage spares us resident parking issues.\u201d\n\nPreviously burnt by quadrupling service charges on a flat, the couple also liked the property\u2019s freehold status \u2014 a common sentiment, says Thomson, who cites increasing annual charges and a wariness around leasehold ownership as reasons why buyers like mews.\n\nTheir original garaging function also remains a strong draw, as Caroline suggests. Perhaps that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been home to many auto-obsessives, such as Formula One drivers James Hunt and Stirling Moss. A home for his beloved car drew Tony and his wife Soo Ying to purchase a property with an integral garage in Pindock Mews in Maida Vale \u2014 a street once the home to the Sex Pistols\u2019 Sid Vicious.\n\nA corner mews, it has been remodelled completely into a 2,500 sq ft two-bedroom house on three floors, with a floating glass staircase to help light filter through. \u201cWe knocked down walls to turn lots of small rooms into larger, more practical spaces,\u201d says Tony, who works in shipping and preferred not to disclose his full name. \u201cNot having a garden is a compromise, but it suited us.\u201d The property is for sale at \u00a33.5mn through Arlington Residential.\n\nDespite its modest front door, the house, like many other mews, is deceptively large. Because planning rules typically require that the front facade with the carriage or garage door must usually stay as is, there\u2019s often little hint of the radical interpretation within.\n\nBuilt with typically 7ft ceiling heights and no windows at the rear, many unmodified mews have a somewhat dingy feel, although the ground floor was built at around 10ft to accommodate horses. Changing ceiling heights and moving walls are typical renovations, according to Andy Willis of RBD Architecture & Interiors. Roof or mansard extensions \u2014 sometimes with the addition of a roof terrace \u2014 are also popular, but can cause issues with the property behind.\n\n\u201cI love mews properties as they are super tricky \u2014 you need to puzzle hard for clever solutions to get the light in from the front or above,\u201d Willis says. To maximise light he employs glass floor panels for landings, as well as back-lit coffered ceilings to give the illusion of natural light. Layered lighting and very tall doors give a greater feeling of space.\n\nIn the past, basement extensions were a popular way to add another floor (or two) but are now limited to a single storey, if permitted at all. And while there was once a vogue for combining adjoining mews houses to create a single larger dwelling \u2014 such as the four-storey, seven-bedroom Reeves Mews in Mayfair, which, at \u00a322.5mn, set the record for the most expensive mews house ever sold in 2015 \u2014 such amalgamations are now generally rejected by planning, says Willis.\n\nOutside London, it\u2019s possible to live in a mews for a lower price point. \u201cThey offer an accessible way for buyers to own a house, rather than a flat, in some excellent central locations,\u201d says Ben Ginn of Savills Edinburgh, where prices start around \u00a3400,000.\u00a0 \u201cso generally sell quickly.\u201d\n\nWhen the mews strikes, you could say.\n\nThis article has been amended since original publication\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow @ft_houseandhome on Instagram", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2eba3e4f-4bda-4f95-a5f2-cae3c598255c"}}, {"id": "15894650-7671-4d57-a2fc-ab435ba78712", "event_name": "CEOs need a mindset shift on growth", "blurb": "Corporate leaders must embrace risk more for the long-term good of their companies", "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Government officials are often a target for business leaders who complain that the right incentives don\u2019t exist to enable their companies to grow.

But taking risks in the face of uncertainty has been harder in recent years as executives struggle with seemingly never-ending upheaval, ranging from geopolitical\u00a0tensions and workforce pressures to technological disruption.\n\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, chief executives in general have become less charismatic, less strategic and more focused on execution, according to a working paper for the US National Bureau of Economic Research. Apart from the tech universe, we seem to be\u00a0in the era of the cost-cutters, not the innovators.\n\n\u201cIn times of crisis and epidemics, wildfires and global warming, and particularly since Covid, we can see that the population as a whole is moving towards a more risk-averse disposition,\u201d says Geoff Trickey, a chartered psychologist who specialises in how risk instincts influence business decisions.\n\nGrowth is difficult to achieve, particularly over the long term. Only one in 10 S&P 500 companies in 2022 had reported growth above GDP for more than 30 years, according to research from McKinsey. Companies such as Airbnb, Microsoft and Burger King rose to prominence or reinvented themselves during periods of economic turbulence. But how many companies are unwittingly ushering in their Kodak or Blockbuster moment?\n\nWhile recent earnings have been strong in the US, a more recent survey of 500 CEOs and other senior leaders by McKinsey pointed to a current gap between their growth ambitions and their ability to hit these targets. Only 29 per cent of respondents said they focused more than a third of their time on long-term initiatives. Importantly, just 30 per cent said they funnelled more resources into new businesses and other growth drivers at times of volatility.\u00a0And just 8 per cent were confident in their organisation\u2019s recruitment pipeline.\n\nIn the UK, things seem particularly glum. A third of UK chief executives\u00a0surveyed\u00a0by PwC don\u2019t even believe their own business will be economically viable in a decade\u2019s time, let alone have confidence in their prospects for growth.\n\nBusiness leaders have every right to blame the domestic backdrop for some of their failure to grow \u2014 from erratic politics to barriers to hiring and investment. High interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty and regulatory concerns have also led to a deal drought in the past few years.\n\nWhile many now believe answers to a paucity of growth lie in the full embrace of artificial intelligence, that won\u2019t resolve the mindset problem. Without confidence, leaders are less likely to make acquisitions, invest in new markets, embrace transformation, manage disruption or steer organisations towards growth.\n\nWith CEO tenure falling, there is a further impetus to focus on the shorter term over committing to investments for the future. It\u2019s why so many leaders underinvest in research and development and fail to cultivate a culture that rewards creativity. Corporate failures in recent years have also\u00a0been so painful, both financially and reputationally, that compliance, legal and public relations teams are far more\u00a0influential than before.\n\nThis is where the board of directors should play a critical role in being effective long-term stewards for an organisation \u2014 helping to recognise and overcome barriers such as a poorly developed talent pipeline. Yet many are afraid of scrutiny themselves \u2014 from their peers, shareholders and the press \u2014 often leading them to hire their own legal counsel, separate from company executives.\u00a0\u201cEveryone is so worried about getting anything slightly wrong,\u201d says one investigations lawyer in the UK.\n\nOf course, pursuing a narrow version of growth at the expense of employees or wider society is also flawed. But there is merit in pushing for a type of expansion that mobilises an organisation, brings staff together behind a common purpose and elevates ambitions. This in turn can generate greater shareholder value, help companies hire star talent, innovate and create jobs. Business leaders pointing fingers at government inertia should take care not to fall into the same traps themselves.\n\nanjli.raval@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this column:A military mnemonic / From Professor Chris Rowley, Kellogg College, University of Oxford and Bayes Business School, University of London, UK", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9ac5ac6a-4288-4750-95a6-7585b2771926"}}, {"id": "bf5926d2-a69d-46cb-b3f8-8294bcba209c", "event_name": "Applying UK inheritance tax to pensions \u2018risks delays and higher costs\u2019", "blurb": "Advisers call for rethink of how Treasury imposes planned extension of IHT to retirement funds ", "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Pension advisers and wealth management chiefs have urged the Treasury to rethink plans for how to apply inheritance tax to pension funds, warning that current proposals could lead to severe delays and increased costs for the bereaved, even in cases where no inheritance tax is due.\n\nIn her Budget last autumn, chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that pension funds would become part of inherited estates by April 2027, a move set to upset tax planning by wealthy people but raise \u00a31.5bn a year for the Treasury by 2030.\n\nThe government estimates its proposals will bring about 1.5 per cent more estates within the scope of death duties in 2027-28, on top of the 4 per cent that already exceed the \u00a3325,000 nil-rate band, which can rise to \u00a3500,000 where a property is passed on.\n\nBut concerns have been raised by tax and pension professionals about potential harmful effects in consultations on the technical details of the government proposals that close on Wednesday.\n\nThe Society Of Pension Professionals, a trade association, warned that the government\u2019s plans \u201cimpose unrealistic and impractical timescales\u201d while applying interest charges or penalties on pension scheme administrators for delays \u201cover which they have little or no control\u201d.\n\nThe chief executives of some of the UK\u2019s largest wealth managers, including Interactive Investor, Quilter and AJ Bell, have also written to the chancellor over the \u201cflawed and potentially damaging\u201d proposals, calling on the government to \u201cwork with the pensions industry to agree a simpler method of achieving the policy aim\u201d.\n\nThe letter, seen by the Financial Times, said: \u201cThe complexity of the proposed approach, namely bringing all pensions into estates for IHT, will lead to substantial delays paying money to beneficiaries on death and cause distress for bereaved families.\u201d\n\nUnder the proposals, personal representatives of inherited pension funds would be responsible for identifying the funds and calculating how much, if any, IHT is owed, taking into account other assets in the estate. The pension scheme administrator would then be responsible for paying the inheritance tax before releasing the funds.\n\nExperts say this could cause delays in payouts, including to those not liable for the tax. Under current rules, inherited pensions can be paid more quickly to beneficiaries and used to pay for probate costs, funeral charges and other urgent bills.\n\n\u201cThe (new) process is complicated and it will punish lower earners,\u201d said Anna Rogers, senior partner at Arc Pensions Law. \u201cWealthy people don\u2019t need the money quickly\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it seems the harm will be disproportionately to those who aren\u2019t wealthy and those who die young.\u201d\n\nLawyers are also concerned that the six-month window between death and the deadline for payment of inheritance tax does not leave enough time for pension funds to be identified and the tax to be calculated, leaving individuals vulnerable to late payment charges.\n\n\u201cPension scheme rules allow two years to pay death benefits\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009there may be a need to sell assets to pay the tax, but there might be cases of people not being able to pay, for example, if a property needs to be sold,\u201d said Jeremy Harris, a partner at Fieldfisher.\n\nThe SPP has urged the government to either leave the calculation and payment of IHT to the pension\u2019s personal representative and HM Revenue & Customs \u2014 or for the benefit to be taxed in full at 40 per cent and paid promptly by the scheme administrator in the minority of cases where a pension is subject to IHT.\n\nSteve Hitchiner, of the SPP, said issues relating to the reporting and payment of inheritance tax on pensions were \u201cvitally important\u201d and the current proposals \u201cwill result in numerous problems and challenges which could be largely avoided\u201d.\n\nSome death-in-service benefits, designed to provide financial security for someone\u2019s dependants if they die unexpectedly young, could also face a large inheritance tax bill, in cases where they are set up as part of the registered pension scheme.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got the potential to be quite a mess\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009at some point there will be a backlash,\u201d Harris said.\n\nKate Smith, head of public affairs at Aegon, added that there is a lack of clarity over what is in scope and that \u201cnobody thinks [the proposals] will work\u201d.\n\nThe Treasury said: \u201cWe continue to incentivise pensions savings for their intended purpose of funding retirement instead of them being openly used as a vehicle to transfer wealth.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c18755be-0b52-4f69-b65f-c0ce5d8fc7df"}}, {"id": "dc0acbe9-32ae-48da-b43d-3088f329d6a3", "event_name": "HMRC was willing to let telephone helplines \u2018fail\u2019, say MPs ", "blurb": "Public accounts committee accuses tax authority of pushing taxpayers too quickly towards digital services", "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0", "body": "The UK tax authority \u201csought to degrade\u201d its telephone helplines and \u201cwas willing to let them fail\u201d in its push to drive taxpayers towards online services, an influential group of cross-party MPs has concluded.\n\nHM Revenue and Customs had been \u201ctoo quick to restrict access to its telephone services before ensuring replacement digital services are fully in place\u201d, the House of Commons public accounts committee said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAll of [HMRC\u2019s] customers have a legal obligation to pay their taxes so it has a responsibility to engage with them,\u201d said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the public accounts committee. \u201cIf I were a teacher marking HMRC\u2019s homework, I\u2019d give it a \u2018could do better\u2019 or a \u2018needs improvement\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe tax authority began its move to using digital services in 2010 with the goal of providing online support to customers, freeing up phone lines for vulnerable individuals and those with complex needs.\n\nBut demand for its helplines has remained high. A report released last May by the National Audit Office spending watchdog found that taxpayers jointly spent the equivalent of nearly 800 years on hold to HMRC in 2022-23 \u2014 more than double the number in 2019-20.\n\nSir Jim Harra, HMRC chief executive, said the committee\u2019s claims were \u201ccompletely baseless\u201d. The tax authority had cut call wait times to around 11 minutes compared with around 28 minutes in April 2024.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe will always be there to answer the phone for those who need extra help. At the same time, more than 80 per cent of customers are satisfied with our digital services.\u201d\n\nThe MPs said in their report that HMRC should \u201creinstate a call waiting time target as a key performance measure\u201d and \u201censure it gives customers accurate estimates of call waiting times in real time\u201d.\n\nThe report urged the tax authority to scrap its policy of cutting off phone calls when a customer has been on hold for 70 minutes. In 2023-24, HMRC terminated more than 43,000 calls in this manner, up sixfold from the previous year, according to the NAO.\n\nIn March 2024, HMRC halted plans to dramatically cut back its helplines with just two days\u2019 notice after a backlash from professional bodies.\n\nThe MPs also called on HMRC to take further action to reduce the money owed to the agency. The tax authority\u2019s debt balance ballooned to \u00a343.9bn in March 2023, up from about \u00a315bn in the five years preceding the pandemic.\n\nThe government announced \u00a3303mn in additional funding in 2023-24 to help HMRC manage tax debts, but the balance had fallen by just 2 per cent \u2014 or \u00a3900mn \u2014 by March 2024.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/57c473c4-32ee-4075-a525-cde782ea71db"}}, {"id": "96b50b6c-df69-406a-ba1c-1261c78fc0dd", "event_name": "Provision of UK public services disrupted by government buildings \u2018left to crumble\u2019 ", "blurb": "Spending watchdog says maintenance backlog totals \u00a349bn, dominated by schools, NHS and MoD properties", "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0", "body": "UK government buildings have been \u201cleft to crumble\u201d causing disruption to public services, the National Audit Office warned on Wednesday.\n\nPoor building conditions and a maintenance backlog of at least \u00a349bn across government departments has disrupted services, hit government productivity and put safety at risk, according to a report by the spending watchdog.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that for too long schools, hospitals and prisons have been left to crumble.

CMA chairs can serve up to a five-year term.\n\nThe government has appointed Doug Gurr as new interim chair of the CMA.\n\nGurr ran Amazon\u2019s UK business during the company\u2019s tussle with the CMA over its minority investment in Deliveroo, which the regulator ultimately approved in 2020. He is currently director of the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nReynolds said in a statement that the government had a \u201cplan for change\u201d that would boost growth for businesses and communities across the UK.\n\n\u201cWe want to see regulators including the CMA supercharging the economy with pro-business decisions that will drive prosperity and growth, putting more money in people\u2019s pockets,\u201d he added.\n\nBokkerink defended his record as CMA chair in a statement, saying that he had helped refocus the agency to ensure it delivered on empowering \u201cconsumers and effective competition \u2014 instead of being held back by a few powerful incumbents setting the rules for everyone else\u201d.\n\nHe added that the CMA\u2019s approach, set out in its annual plan last week, \u201cwill no doubt change.

Its October Budget, which heaped tax rises on to business, has made the clash even more acute. As the Financial Times has reported, the government is now seeking compromises on parts of its landmark employment rights bill. Yet what it has offered so far is fiddling around the edges. If Labour is to foster the economic dynamism the UK needs, it must go much further in adjusting the legislation to meet business concerns.\n\nThe bill gives workers protection against unfair dismissal from day one, with a probation period, and stronger rights on flexible working. It includes a clampdown on \u201cexploitative\u201d use of zero-hours contracts, and on fire and rehire tactics. The government\u2019s own analysis estimates it will cost business \u00a35bn a year to implement the package.\n\nWhat has riled companies, however, is how Labour has combined these changes with Budget increases in payroll taxes \u2014 both raising the rate and slashing the threshold at which they kick in \u2014 and a big rise in the national minimum wage. This triple whammy will sharply lift the costs, in particular, of low-wage and entry-level jobs, creating a disincentive to hire and expand. Figures on Tuesday showed employers have cut staff numbers since the Budget.\n\nNudging companies to invest more in technology, as many now say they will, and rely less on low-wage workers is in theory no bad thing given the UK\u2019s poor labour productivity. But the freed-up workers need to be recycled into new and productive jobs. If soaring costs are deterring businesses across the economy from hiring, that works against the government\u2019s priority of creating both more, and more secure, employment.\n\nSince Labour is unlikely to revisit its flagship Budget measures \u2014 the bigger worry for business \u2014 it will need to be doubly careful about how it rolls out new employment rights. That does not mean the reforms should be abandoned. Action is badly needed to curb abuses, reduce precarity and help people caring for family to work. But the government should adjust how it plans to implement the measures \u2014 or, if necessary, amend the legislation \u2014 to avoid penalising business.\n\nOn zero-hours contracts, the government should look again at how it can include agency workers in the new right to a guaranteed-hours contract, while still allowing employers enough flexibility. And it should ensure that the reference period over which workers\u2019 regular hours are calculated takes account of seasonal fluctuations, to ensure it does not hamper, say, retailers staffing up temporarily in the holiday season.\n\nLabour has already compromised on its original aim of granting protection for employees against unfair dismissal on day one \u2014 down from two years at present \u2014 by allowing a nine-month probation period with a \u201clighter-touch\u201d dismissals process. But small businesses warn even this is an insufficient safeguard against vexatious claims that can be cripplingly expensive to defend. Better to set the unfair dismissals threshold at, say, six months, more in line with some European counterparts.\n\nMaking it harder for businesses to fire workers then rehire them on worse terms is justified. The proposals, though, are too tightly drawn, requiring companies to be almost insolvent before they can change contracts.

He criticised Bain for refusing to accept the verdicts of two judicial commissions in their entirety.\n\n\u201cSurely Bain should not be permitted to operate public contracts in the UK, at least until it has repaid all the fees earned from the South African state during the Zuma-Gupta [business family] years, made full disclosure\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and the Zondo-recommended legal action against the company should be completed,\u201d Hain stated.\n\nIn his reply to Hain, McFadden said he shared the concerns about suppliers to the British government needing to operate to high standards. \u201cThe Zondo commission referred to Bain\u2019s role in Sars [South African Revenue Service] as unlawful and concluded they had engaged in collusion and state capture,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the minister said he had requested legal advice on options to extend the ban, only to be told that there were \u201cno legal routes\u201d to do so. \u201cThis advice was tested with expert counsel who confirmed that no legal route existed for extension of the ban and therefore the government is unable to do so.\u201d\n\nMcFadden said he could not take a further decision unless material new information came to light that had not been considered by the previous administration.\n\nThe Cabinet Office minister said that under the Procurement Act 2023 there would be new powers from February this year to take stronger and broader action against suppliers involved in misconduct. \u201cI am actively exploring options for enhancing these powers and further measures to enable the government to take even stronger (action) against suppliers, like Bain, who have committed misconduct.\u201d\n\nBain & Co said in a statement that it had taken significant measures to strengthen its governance for public sector contracts since its work with Sars from 2015 to 2017.\n\n\u201cWhile there were no findings from two official commissions of inquiry of any illegal actions by Bain, we accepted responsibility for the events at that time and repaid all fees, with interest, to Sars,\u201d it said.\n\nHain said he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d but understood the reasons for McFadden\u2019s conclusions. \u201cBain should take no comfort.

The trend reflects China becoming a key rival to the US in R&D spending and innovations, including AI.\n\nThe figures relate to the level of R&D funded by companies, not all of which is carried out in the country in which the company is registered.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer last week pledged to \u201cmove fast and take action to win the global race\u201d on AI, which is at the forefront of innovation and has enjoyed a surge in investment around the world in recent years.\n\nHe described the fast-evolving technology as a \u201cchance to turbocharge growth\u201d \u2014 a core mission of his administration.\n\nBut Carlos L\u00f3pez-G\u00f3mez, head of policy links at IfM Engage, a consultancy at the University of Cambridge, said the US and China were \u201cway ahead of the UK\u201d on AI and \u201cwe should worry about the fall in the number of UK companies among the top global R&D spenders\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe should also worry that despite the UK being a global leader in academic scientific research, the private sector is not as R&D-intensive,\u201d he added.\n\nSeparate figures tracked by the OECD show that the cumulative amount of venture capital invested in AI start-ups between 2012 and 2023 totalled $427bn in the US and $232bn in China, but only $29.8bn in the UK.\n\nOverall UK business investment, which is considered a key factor for innovation and productivity growth and of which R&D is a part, rose in the first three quarters of 2024, according to official figures.\n\nBut Britain has underperformed the US over the past decade following weak business investment growth since the Brexit referendum. The US lead in tech has been identified as a key factor in its faster productivity growth over Britain and the EU in the past 20 years.\n\nThe UK had only two companies, pharmaceutical groups AstraZeneca and GSK, in the top 100 R&D spenders in 2023, the latest year for which the EU scoreboard figures, published at the end of last month, are available.\n\nWith investment from 275 companies, software and computing services received the most financial backing of any sector among the top 2,000 R&D spenders in 2023. Of the 275 companies, 158 were from the US, 59 were Chinese and seven were from the UK.\n\nL\u00f3pez-G\u00f3mez said that while Britain ranked well in academic research output and top-performing universities, its scientific knowledge was \u201cnot translating into economic value\u201d.\n\nThe country was at \u201crisk of becoming the lab of the world, having all these\u2009new technologies\u201d that would be scaled up in order to deliver high-paid jobs overseas, he added, as he called on ministers to \u201cthink not only on technology development but also adoption in a way that relates to business objectives\u201d.\n\nNonetheless, experts have welcomed Starmer\u2019s AI measures, which include increasing public compute capacity by twentyfold and creating a National Data Library.\n\nUmang Paw, chief technology officer at advisory firm PwC UK, said the policies marked a \u201cwelcome step forward as the UK looks to grasp the huge opportunities that AI can provide to the country\u2019s economy and public services\u201d.\n\nPaul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said AI would \u201cencourage investment and lead to much faster productivity growth\u201d irrespective of where innovation occurred.\n\nThe UK\u2019s strength in services meant it \u201cwas better placed to enjoy a bigger boost than most other major economies,\u201d he said, adding that success would rest in part on the government \u201csetting the right conditions and not regulating it [AI] too heavily\u201d.\n\nThe government said it was \u201cdetermined to unleash UK R&D as a driving force in our mission to grow the economy\u201d and that Britain continued \u201cto attract high levels of international investment\u201d.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8f7614b4-1a4a-4214-9af0-cbb08482d224"}}, {"id": "0173292b-3e0c-45ca-9d43-ae78fad6badb", "event_name": "UK faces terror risk from radicalised \u2018loners and misfits\u2019, warns Keir Starmer  ", "blurb": "PM vows to introduce tougher laws if necessary after Southport killer pleaded guilty ", "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0", "body": "Sir Keir Starmer has warned the UK faces a terror threat from \u201cloners, misfits [and] young men in their bedrooms\u201d, as he vowed to change the law if needed to prevent a repeat of the Southport killings.\n\nThe threat from political groups such as al-Qaeda now sits \u201calongside\u201d the risk from individuals \u201caccessing all manner of material online\u201d who were \u201cfixated on extreme violence\u201d and became \u201cdesperate for notoriety\u201d, the prime minister said on Tuesday.\n\nHe promised that last summer\u2019s attack \u2014 when 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana murdered three young girls at a dance class \u2014 would mark a \u201cline in the sand\u201d for Britain.\n\n\u201cIf the law needs to change to recognise this new and dangerous threat, we will change it, and quickly,\u201d promised Starmer.\n\nRudakubana on Monday pleaded guilty to murder.\n\nIn July last year, he killed Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Da Silva Aguiar, nine, in what prosecutors called a \u201cmeticulously planned rampage\u201d.\n\nLast year, MI5 head Sir Ken McCallum warned that one in eight terrorists being investigated in the UK were minors who were often recruited online. The domestic intelligence agency had seen a three-fold increase in investigations into under-18s in three years, he said in October.\n\nStarmer was speaking on Tuesday as it became apparent that Rudakubana was known to multiple authorities, including the government\u2019s Prevent counter-extremism programme, which had rejected three referrals by other agencies.

There have been questions, including from Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, as to why more details of his background were not released sooner.\n\nInitially after the attack, the authorities would not confirm the identity of Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time and was born in Cardiff to parents who had emigrated from Rwanda.\n\nA wave of online misinformation ensued, claiming that the suspect was an illegal asylum seeker, helping to trigger far-right riots in towns and cities for days afterwards.\n\nStarmer, the former head of public prosecutions, said: \u201cIf this trial had collapsed because I, or anyone else, had revealed details while the police were investigating\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009then the vile individual who committed these crimes would have walked away a free man.\u201d\n\nCooper insisted that British contempt of court law, which dates back to 1981 and is intended to prevent prejudicial information being released during justice proceedings, underpinned the initial absence of public information in the aftermath of the killings.\n\nIn response, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said that the authorities could nonetheless have released more details than they did.\n\nThe killer\u2019s possession of terror-related material was eventually made public in October, when Rudakubana was charged with further offences, said Philp. \u201cSo if it can be made public in October, without risking prejudice of the murder trial, it follows that it could have been made public in August without prejudicing that same trial,\u201d he said.\n\nRudakubana was not charged with committing an act of terrorism because, according to police, a clear motive for the murders had not been established.\n\nSoon after his guilty plea on Monday, it emerged that concerns about Rudakubana\u2019s behaviour had been circulating among agencies for years.\n\nIn 2019, he took a knife into school, prompting the involvement of five agencies, including the police and social services. Two months later, he attacked a fellow pupil with a hockey stick.\n\nPolice were called five times to his house over the three years that followed due to concerns about his behaviour, and he was repeatedly referred to the multi-agency team responsible for child safeguarding in Lancashire, where he lived, as well as to the youth justice system.\n\nStarmer said public agencies would not be allowed to \u201cdeflect\u201d questions during the forthcoming public inquiry.\n\nRudakubana is due to be sentenced in Liverpool on Thursday.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c3a92c89-d266-4871-a7b0-aba9dcb8a34c"}}, {"id": "ffc336db-0192-4b44-90d4-5790ec54abb2", "event_name": "UK ministers poised to approve expansion of Gatwick airport", "blurb": "Government could also give the go-ahead to development of Luton to allow more passengers", "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0", "body": "Ministers are preparing to give the go-ahead to an expansion of Gatwick, the UK\u2019s second-largest airport, as part of a broader push to nurture economic growth.\n\nThe government is also keen to approve an expansion of Luton airport if concerns about noise pollution from passenger jets flying over rural areas can be addressed.\n\nIn addition, chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to reaffirm her support for Heathrow, the UK\u2019s largest airport, to build a third runway in a speech about economic growth later this month, according to officials. But such a project could be a long way off being realised.\n\nMinisters are planning to unveil more proposals to aid growth. The UK economy expanded by 0.1 per cent in November, following 0.1 per cent contractions in both October and September, according to official data.\n\nInvestor fears about stagflation \u2014 when sluggish growth combines with persistent price pressures \u2014 contributed to a sharp rise in UK government borrowing costs at the start of the year, although gilt yields fell last week amid expectations of more interest rate cuts.\n\nThe expansion of Britain\u2019s airports has long been a contentious issue, given jets contribute to noise and air pollution, as well as climate change, but two government decisions are expected soon.\n\nTransport secretary Heidi Alexander must decide by February 27 on Gatwick\u2019s plan to bring its standby runway into regular use.\n\nThe work is part of a \u00a32.2bn project that would enable Gatwick to handle up to 75mn passengers a year by the late 2030s, up from the record 46.5mn who used the single-runway airport in 2019.\n\nOne person familiar with the government\u2019s thinking said a go-ahead for the scheme was an \u201cabsolutely sure thing\u201d given its economic benefits and relatively straightforward environmental challenges.\n\nGatwick referred to a previous statement in which it said it had put forward a \u201cstrong\u201d case for making best use of its existing infrastructure, while minimising noise and environmental impacts.\n\nAlexander must rule by April 3 on Luton airport\u2019s proposals to increase passenger numbers to 32mn each year, up from its current annual limit of 18mn.\n\nGovernment insiders said Luton\u2019s expansion was likely to be approved, but officials are working through how to address concerns about the extra noise over the Chiltern Hills, which are designated as an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nAlberto Martin, chief executive of Luton airport, said expansion of the facility \u201cfully aligns with the government\u2019s sustainable growth agenda by making best use of existing infrastructure\u201d, and would create thousands of jobs.\n\nReeves said last July she wanted Heathrow to expand so long as it met certain environmental criteria, a stance that puts her at odds with energy secretary Ed Miliband and London mayor Sadiq Khan.\n\nA spokesperson for Khan said on Tuesday: \u201cThe mayor has a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London \u2014 linked to the negative impact on air quality, noise and London\u2019s ability to reach net zero by 2030.\u201d\n\nOne government insider said Heathrow\u2019s third runway remained a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d situation, with the company\u2019s management refusing to commit to the project unless and until it received full backing from ministers.\n\nLabour has said it will allow Heathrow\u2019s expansion if it passes four \u201ctests\u201d set by ministers relating to climate change, noise, air pollution and economic growth.\n\nBut experts doubt Heathrow could pass all the tests even if there were rapid growth in the fledgling market for \u201csustainable aviation fuel\u201d made from crops and other non-fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cThere are live development consent orders on Luton and Gatwick, but it\u2019s worth mentioning there is no live proposal from Heathrow,\u201d said one government official involved in the discussions.\n\nBloomberg reported that Reeves could use her growth speech to announce some of the government\u2019s key decisions on infrastructure projects, and that she could look favourably on a development consent order for a third runway at Heathrow.\n\nHeathrow said growing the economy meant adding capacity at the airport. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re planning to unlock capacity by improving and upgrading our existing infrastructure, while also looking at potential options to deliver a third runway at Heathrow in line with strict tests on carbon, noise and air quality.\u201d\n\nBut Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester,\u00a0told\u00a0Times Radio that a third runway at Heathrow was not a good idea as it \u201cdiverts infrastructure investment away from the north and traps it in London\u201d.\n\nBurnham added that it was \u201ca model for an ever overheating UK economy rather than a more balanced, levelled-up economy\u201d. He said Manchester airport did not operate at full capacity and had potential for expansion. \u201cThe right thing to do is to go back to that plan that links modern high-speed [rail] lines north and south, east and west through Manchester airport.\u00a0And that\u2019s what I would call on the government to do.\u201d\n\nAnother transport project which is set to get the go-ahead from ministers in the coming months is the \u00a39bn Lower Thames Crossing, a new highway and tunnel across the river to the east of London, according to officials.\n\nReeves is expected to use a private finance model for the crossing, with investors securing returns in exchange for bankrolling the project.\n\nA government spokesperson said Labour was determined to get the economy moving and secure the long-term future of the UK\u2019s aviation sector.\n\n\u201cAll expansion proposals must demonstrate they contribute to economic growth\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009while remaining in line with existing environmental obligations,\u201d they added.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/215573e1-241e-429e-8289-c00d78b9123b"}}, {"id": "1c29393d-b76d-411c-87c9-706fa6f548cb", "event_name": "Axel Rudakubana and the changing face of terrorism ", "blurb": "Unclear and hard-to-categorise motives of suspects pose rising challenge for security services ", "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning. Axel Rudakubana has pleaded guilty to murdering three young girls, 10 charges of attempted murder, the production of the poison ricin and possession of a terrorist training manual.\n\nThe unexpected guilty plea \u2014 at the start of the trial Rudakubana had refused even to confirm his name \u2014 means that the families of Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice da Silva Aguiar will not have to go through a lengthy trial.\n\nBut like many others, they still have questions about how someone who was referred to Prevent, the UK\u2019s deradicalisation programme, three times between 2019 and 2021 because of his obsession with violence went on to commit three murders in 2024.\n\nThe government has announced a public inquiry into what went wrong. Some thoughts on some of the challenges that the security services and police face and what an inquiry might usefully ask.\n\nIn October, Ken McCallum, MI5\u2019s director-general, gave his annual threat update. One bit in particular has stuck with me (bold emphasis mine):\n\nAlthough Rudakubana has pleaded guilty to possessing Military Studies In The Jihad Against The Tyrants: The Al-Qaeda Training Manual, a terrorist how-to-guide, he appears to have been interested in it for its methods rather than its motive. Ursula Doyle, the prosecutor, described him as \u201ca young man with a sickening and sustained interest in death and violence\u201d. One reason why Rudakubana was not picked up when he should have been is that he did not fit neatly into any of the usual boxes.\n\n(There are also, I think, striking similarities between some of the new threats mentioned by McCallum and the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, where the accused appears to be someone with a \u201ctenuous grasp\u201d of their ideologies.)\n\nAs Keir Starmer said this morning, terrorism has a new face, that alongside \u201chighly organised groups like Al-Qaida\u201d, now \u201cwe also see acts of extreme violence perpetrated by loners, misfits, young men in their bedroom, accessing all manner of material online, desperate for notoriety, sometimes inspired by traditional terrorist groups, but fixated on that extreme violence, seemingly for its own sake\u201d. The question this inquiry will seek to answer is how to remodel parts of our counterterror system to identify and tackle that new threat.\n\nJonathan Hall KC, the independent reviewer of the UK\u2019s terrorism legislation, explained the gap in the state\u2019s threat response this morning on the Today programme:\n\nKeir Starmer is right this morning to say that the answer to this question is to expand the definition of terror. At no point has Rudakubana\u2019s case been treated as \u201cterror-related\u201d precisely because of the absence of a clear underlying ideology. That exposes a flaw in how we think about terror and how we identify threats in a changing world.\n\nAlthough the threat profile of people who commit violent offences and violent terror offences is often similar \u2014 a man, usually a young man, who is alienated from and hostile to society \u2014 the methods by which they are recruited by Islamist extremists or the far right are different. How the security services monitor them and detect them is different. Their targets are different.\n\nThere are some important overlaps in both method and threat, but maintaining that specificity about motive and therefore the method for foiling plots is important. This new form of terrorism, too, has similarities in terms of the people most likely to commit it \u2014 but the methods by which we monitor, detect and stop them will also need to change.\n\nI mostly listened to Joan Baez\u2019s Diamonds & Rust while writing my column this week.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e78330c5-cbe0-47be-a637-66f62fe3189b"}}, {"id": "5e7f748d-ae5a-4d0f-991e-70391d05f5ce", "event_name": "UK employers cut jobs after Budget, official data shows", "blurb": "Drop in payrolled workforce comes even as wage growth accelerates ", "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0", "body": "UK employers cut staff numbers after the Labour government\u2019s tax-raising Budget even as wage growth accelerated, official data showed on Tuesday.\n\nPayrolled employment fell 0.1 per cent between October and November and was 11,000 lower in the three months to November than in the previous quarter, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.\n\nEarly estimates for December suggest a bigger month-on-month drop of 47,000 to 30.3mn in the payrolled workforce.\n\nAt the same time, average weekly earnings in the three months to November were 5.6 per cent higher than a year earlier, both including and excluding bonuses \u2014 up from 5.2 per cent in the previous period, the ONS said.\n\nThe figures add to mounting evidence that economic growth has faltered and the jobs market weakened following Rachel Reeves\u2019 October Budget, in which businesses bore the brunt of \u00a340bn in tax increases.\n\nAlthough the full impact of the Budget changes would only be seen later in the year, \u201cthe warning lights on recruitment, employment and training are already flashing\u201d, said Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, after the data was published.\n\nAn increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions and a rise in the minimum wage have combined to leave some sectors facing a sharp jump in their cost of labour when the measures take effect in April.\n\nSurveys suggest businesses will try to offset higher costs by cutting jobs, squeezing wages or passing them on to consumers through higher prices.\n\nPolicymakers at the Bank of England are watching closely to see which of these effects dominates. Analysts said that despite stronger wage growth, which policymakers see as inflationary, Tuesday\u2019s figures reinforced the case to cut interest rates in February.\n\nFigures last week showed UK GDP grew a meagre 0.1 per cent in November, undershooting economists\u2019 forecasts, after mild contractions in September and October.The BoE left rates unchanged at 4.75 per cent last month after cutting borrowing costs twice in 2024. Markets largely expect that the central bank will cut its benchmark rate by a quarter-point in February.\n\nAccording to levels implied in swaps markets, traders anticipate at least two quarter-point rate cuts this year and have priced in a 50 per cent chance of a third.\n\nSterling, which was already weaker on Tuesday after a rebound in the dollar, remained 0.6 per cent lower after the data at $1.2259.\n\nAshley Webb, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said that while rising private sector pay growth would \u201ccause the Bank of England some unease\u201d, more timely figures based on HMRC records suggested that \u201cthis latest burst of wage growth is already fading\u201d.\n\nThe figures come as Reeves heads to Davos to make the case for the UK as a destination for international investment, with the government facing increasing criticism for triggering a downturn in the jobs market.\n\n\u201cThere is growing evidence that firms have effectively pressed pause on hiring post-Budget,\u201d said Thomas Pugh, economist at the audit firm RSM UK.

Donald Trump\u2019s big bang, day one action on tariffs appeared, at first, to be almost nothing at all: a memo calling for the evaluation of US trade relationships. The memo, reportedly, amounted to no more than giving the sabres a good rattle. It looked like win for the bark>bite view of his presidency, to which Unhedged subscribes, and was consistent with the emphasis on gradual and negotiated tariff policy from most (but not all) of the president\u2019s economic advisers.\n\nMarkets seemed to like it, too, though it is not clear how big a discount the market had already placed on Trump tough talk on tariffs. The dollar had a pretty big decline, suggesting a degree of surprise. The upward shift in equity futures was more muted. At the very least, the non-action seemed to confirm that the administration knows markets doesn\u2019t like tariffs, and it wants markets to be happy.\n\nThe reprieve lasted a few hours. In the evening, Trump told reporters he was \u201cthinking of\u201d putting 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico. \u201cI think we\u2019ll do it February 1,\u201d he said. The dollar reversed course against the currencies of the two countries.\n\nA comment to be taken at face value? Probably not. A negotiating ploy? Almost certainly. But for markets, strategic ambiguity cannot go on forever. Trump likes tariffs and tariff threats. Investors, on the whole, do not. At some point the time for posturing will end and the time for policy will begin.\n\nTrump probably can\u2019t have both continued high corporate profits and a lower trade deficit. And that will not be the only decision he will face. He will also have to balance America becoming \u201ca manufacturing nation again\u201d against realising \u201cmassive amounts of money from tariffs\u201d; the two aims suggest very different tariff regimes.\n\nSimilarly, he has promised much lower energy prices and big increases in domestic energy production. He can deliver, at best, one of the two. While the market waits for him to make his compromises, volatility seems like a good bet.\n\nThe president is being no more dishonest than our national tradition allows. It is standard to use the inaugural address to promise every citizen a tax cut, a lower deficit, world peace, and a pony.

Our tentative answer was no. When you adjust the two markets\u2019 valuations for expected growth over the next few years, the UK discount looks small. And there are not many companies in the UK indices that look like wonderful bargains. But readers wrote in with some ideas.\n\nSeveral readers suggest comparing HSBC, Lloyd\u2019s and other UK banks to their US counterparts; or BP to ExxonMobil and Chevron. An interesting contrast but, as Unhedged wrote in a discussion of the UK discount two years ago, there are structural reasons that UK oil companies should be cheaper than US ones: US companies have better reserve profiles, and many European institutional investors\u2019 mandates prevent them from owning oil stocks. As for UK banks, they have slower-growing home markets and/or much weaker capital markets and trading operations than their US peers. Readers may disagree, but we don\u2019t see the oil and banking discounts getting meaningfully smaller any time soon.\n\nOthers wrote back to us with interesting comparisons from our list of UK companies with high US exposure, several of which we have added to the table below, along with a few of our own (Tesco does not have high US exposure, but we thought the comparison to Kroger was interesting):\n\nUnlike our European comparisons from last week, there is at least the smell of some bargains here. Some UK companies trade at big discounts to US peers that are not explained by near-term earnings expectations. Medical device maker Smith & Nephew (a company with high US exposure) is much cheaper than Stryker, and the same goes for credit reporting agencies Experian and Equifax.\n\nSeveral UK companies are also valued in the same band as their US counterpart, but give you higher expected growth for your buck: BAE, Tesco, and AstraZeneca. Of course, this is only a starting point. There is much more to explore before declaring the UK half of the pair to be cheap. But it\u2019s something.\n\nMichel Lerner of UBS\u2019s Holt team wrote with another insight into the valuation gap between the S&P 500 and FTSE 100. He noted the difference in valuation has never been greater in terms of free cash flow yield, as his chart of the yields shows:\n\nLerner points out, however, the UK market is packed with value stocks, that is, stocks that are highly cyclical and not particularly profitable through the cycle:\n\nUK growth and quality (high profitability) stocks look \u201cmore attractively valued than US peers\u201d, Lerner says, but there just aren\u2019t very many stocks in either category in the UK, especially among big caps.\n\nThe point about market cap brings us to another interesting comparison. Without big tech companies of their own, the European and UK indices somewhat resemble US mid-caps: decent margins, some international exposure, and a high proportion of value companies. The other day we noted there is only about a 10 per cent premium on the S&P 500 large-cap index relative to the EU and UK indices, using a PEG analysis. Here is the same analysis using the S&P 400 mid-cap index:\n\nThough PEG ratio is an imperfect metric, it suggests that the S&P 400 US mid-cap index might be cheaper than the UK and EU big-cap indices. If you are uneasy with the valuations of big-cap US stocks, looking at smaller stocks might make as much sense as looking abroad, or more.\n\n(Reiter and Armstrong)\n\nIn our last letter, we wrote that Peter Navarro was the former US trade representative and Robert Lighthizer was an adviser in the first administration. That was a mix up. Lighthizer was USTR, Navarro was a trade adviser and the director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, an office created by the Trump administration, which was not filled during the Biden administration.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is determined to \u201cmake the UK irresistible to AI firms looking to start, scale, or grow their business\u201d, and that means clearing away planning obstacles for private-sector investment in the physical infrastructure on which artificial intelligence depends.\n\nBut something has been tripping me up in the recent flurry of announcements about data centre projects: the sheer number of new jobs that appear to be involved. \u201cOver 4,000 jobs will be created\u201d by a \u00a310bn investment by Blackstone in a data centre campus in Northumberland, the government has announced. A separate \u00a314bn-worth of investment in AI infrastructure by three tech companies will \u201cdeliver 13,250 jobs across the UK\u201d, Starmer has said. Hang on. Data centres are stuffed with machines, not humans. Microsoft, for example, says its data centre buildings employ about 50 people each. So where are these big job forecasts coming from?\n\nLet\u2019s take the Northumberland project, which envisages 10 data centres built on land that had been slated for the (failed) Britishvolt battery plant. According to the planning documents, the development \u201cis estimated to require up to 40 people per data centre\u201d. Once all 10 centres are built (expected by 2035) that makes 400 jobs, a tenth of the number the government cited.\n\nThe planning documents say \u201cpeak monthly construction employment could be in the region of 1,200 jobs\u201d \u2014 these aren\u2019t permanent roles but there is likely to be a decade\u2019s worth of construction work on the site, so they aren\u2019t fleeting jobs either. Even so, the operational and construction jobs combined only account for 1,600 jobs. Where are the rest?\n\nNow we enter the murkier realm of economists\u2019 models. It is common practice to estimate the number of \u201cindirect\u201d and \u201cinduced\u201d jobs created by a big investment. These are the jobs that will be created in the supply chain and as a result of the new employees spending their money in local pubs, shops and so on. The planning documents for the Northumberland project say that one direct job in a data centre can support between five and seven additional jobs in the local economy and related industries, which \u201ccould equate to an additional 2,000 to 2,800 jobs in the local economy once all ten data centre buildings are operational\u201d. Take 2,400 as the midpoint and we have reached the government\u2019s 4,000 number.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume there will be some spillover jobs, but the \u201cmultipliers\u201d applied are often derived from models and can vary a lot by sector and country. Blackstone told me the multiplier cited in the planning documents was drawn from PwC research into the impact of data centres in the US, which was commissioned by the Data Center Coalition, the membership association for the industry.\n\nHenry Overman, a professor of economic geography at the London School of Economics, told me that academics tend to find smaller multipliers when they do after-the-fact empirical studies of what happened when new jobs arrived in an area. His study into the impact of the BBC\u2019s decision to move 1,700 medium and high-skilled jobs to Salford in Greater Manchester between 2011 and 2012, for example, found that each BBC job created on average 0.33 additional jobs in the creative industries, rising to 0.55 additional jobs by 2017. He and his colleagues found no significant effect on total employment.\n\nNone of this is to say the project isn\u2019t positive for Northumberland. But for the government, why invite public disappointment or cynicism by bundling all these estimates into one big number, when you could treat people with respect and give them all the details from the start? An alternative could sound something like: \u201cThis project will create a moderate number of skilled jobs and a decade\u2019s worth of construction work. It will probably have wider local benefits too, but it\u2019s hard to put a precise number on it.\u201d Admittedly, that might not be eye-catching and boosterish, but my sense is that people are in no mood for eye-catching boosterism these days anyway.\n\nThere are plenty of good arguments for the economic importance of data centres (as well as some concerns about energy and water use), but \u201cthey create tonnes of local jobs\u201d isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nIf Starmer wants to revive productivity growth as much as he says he does, he will have to get comfortable talking about the expansion of industries that produce a lot of value without needing many employees. For these new types of sectors, which are capital-intensive but not labour-intensive, the Labour government needs to update its script.\n\nsarah.oconnor@ft.com", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2f25065d-3eeb-49f6-a5eb-8d22ed4697a5"}}, {"id": "38dadd05-2df6-4c56-9c64-455abd848168", "event_name": "Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio warns of UK \u2018debt death spiral\u2019", "blurb": "Sell-off in gilts since Budget suggests market balking at higher borrowing needs, says billionaire investor", "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0", "body": "Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of hedge fund firm Bridgewater Associates, has warned that the UK could be heading for a \u201cdebt death spiral\u201d, in which it has to borrow more and more money to service its rising interest costs.\n\nDalio told the Financial Times that the recent sell-off in the gilt market, coupled with bouts of sterling weakness, suggested that the market was struggling to absorb the UK\u2019s higher borrowing needs since last October\u2019s Budget.\n\nThe combination of rising annual interest payments, which have already topped \u00a3100bn a year, and the need to roll over debt at higher borrowing costs, created the risk of a self-reinforcing cycle, he said.\n\nThis \u201clooks like a debt death spiral in the making because it will either require more borrowing to service the debt that will have to be serviced, squeeze out other spending, or require more taxes\u201d, said Dalio in an interview.\n\nThe market turbulence \u201creflects a supply-demand problem\u201d for gilts, he said. \u201cWhy else would long-term [yields] rise when there\u2019s an easing [of monetary policy], the exchange rate is going down, and the economy is weak?\u201d\n\nHe also said the US is \u201cexhibiting signs\u201d that the market could start to struggle to absorb its borrowing needs, and called getting a handle on the country\u2019s debt burden the \u201cfirst big issue\u201d for President Trump\u2019s second term in office.\n\nA global bond sell-off in recent months has sent borrowing costs racing higher in big economies such as the UK and US, even as central banks continue to cut interest rates.\n\nThe UK\u2019s 10-year borrowing costs rose from 3.75 per cent in mid-September to a 16-year high earlier this month at 4.93 per cent, amid a global bond sell-off and anxiety over the UK economy. Yields have since recovered some ground to 4.66 per cent on Monday.\n\nUS 10-year yields have reached 4.62 per cent, up one percentage point over the same timeframe. Yields move inversely to prices.\n\nA big driver has been stickier-than-expected inflation, which has led markets to price in shallower rate cuts, but some big investors have also voiced concerns about higher levels of borrowing by countries already carrying large debt burdens.\n\n\u201cWhen you get to the point that you have to borrow money to service the debt and interest rates are rising, so that debt service payments rise, so you need to borrow more money to pay them, you\u2019re in what the markets call a death spiral,\u201d said Dalio, who this month published the first part of his new analysis of sovereign debt crises, How Countries Go Broke.\n\n\u201cAs those risks increase, everybody looks at that need to borrow more money at higher interest, which creates [a] self-reinforcing debt deterioration cycle.\u201d\n\nThe sell-off in sterling and gilts has evoked memories of the market crisis following former Prime Minister Liz Truss\u2019s ill-fated 2022 \u201cmini\u201d Budget. At the time, Dalio wrote that the market plunge \u201csuggests incompetence\u201d.\n\nInvestors have largely dismissed comparisons, partly given the sell-off has not been as large or as sharp,\u00a0but the government was forced to defend its economic plans this month as its borrowing costs hit a post-financial crisis high, while chancellor Rachel Reeves has faced calls to resign.\n\nA Treasury spokesperson said the government\u2019s \u201ccommitment to fiscal rules and sound public finances is non-negotiable\u201d, adding: \u201cThe chancellor has already shown that tough decisions on spending will be taken, with the spending review to root out waste ongoing.\u201d\n\nDalio called for US and UK government deficits to be reduced to 3 per cent of GDP. The US deficit is expected to remain above 6 per cent of GDP this year, while the UK\u2019s is set to hit 4.5 per cent this fiscal year.\n\nSome analysts have warned that radical cuts to spending or fresh taxes would damage countries\u2019 economic growth and hit their finances.\n\nDalio accepted that \u201ccutting the budget deficit is depressing for growth and inflation, [but] it will lead to lower interest rates and those lower interest rates have a big stimulative effect while also reducing the budget deficit\u201d.\n\nDalio, who stepped down as Bridgewater\u2019s chair in 2021 but remains on the board, has previously warned of the danger of mounting US debt to Treasuries investors.

The answer is predictable: you and anyone who breathes in your smoke. When you buy from a dealer, whether in New York or in London, the answer is unpredictable. The money you are pumping into the criminal economy isn\u2019t just going to be confined to scrappy dealers whose dreams of setting up a reputable institution are just a single act of Parliament away. Your dealer, most of the time, will use the profits from your toke to invest in all sorts of criminal activities: the path it has taken to be sold in the first place is studded with violence and exploitation.\n\nIt\u2019s true to say that drug usage has a variety of negative consequences for its users and, on the whole, governments are right to advise against it. People in New York who smoke cannabis should probably smoke less of it, or stop entirely. That said, this is also true of people in London who drink wine. The difference is, my wine habit and a New Yorker\u2019s spliffs are problems for ourselves. Say what you like about someone with an excessive fondness for the natural wine fad, shipping a bottle of Cr\u00e9mant to my flat has never killed anyone. No one gets knifed on the bus to school because of a New Yorker\u2019s CBD gummies. But illegal drug taking doesn\u2019t just harm users: the surge in cocaine sales in western Europe has also seen a surge in violence in Ecuador and the Caribbean, according to the UN.\n\nThat\u2019s the unanswerable argument as to why the UK should emulate New York or the Netherlands and legalise cannabis: the attempt to reduce drug usage through prohibition has been a failure with many innocent casualties. In the year leading up to March 2024 in England and Wales, 8.8 per cent of people reported taking some kind of illegal drug. And 11.9 per cent did the same for cigarettes. The important difference is that the tenth of the population who smoke cigarettes are filling government coffers with taxes and doing themselves great harm. The 8.8 per cent are doing absolutely nothing for the government finances while doing great harm to others.\n\nThe bloody consequences of prohibition are that, when you buy illegal drugs, you are financing violence, murder and criminality across the supply chain. But those consequences are also predictable: no one who buys cannabis, let alone cocaine, does so in the mistaken belief that the person they are WhatsApping is just an employee of the local corner shop going the extra mile.\n\nAcross the world, we liberal reformers have done a better job of winning the argument against government prohibition than we have making the argument that we all, whether as governments or just consumers, have a responsibility to act ethically. There is a moral difference, and not just a regulatory one, in whether a New Yorker buys weed from an illicit dealer or a legal dispensary. That moral difference goes right to the heart of the argument for legalising most drugs: that the legal supply chain has fewer social harms than the illegal one. And those of us who want to change our drug laws should say so: we should argue that it is both shameful for governments to perpetuate prohibition and shameful for individual customers to buy illegal drugs.\n\nWhen governments prohibit drugs, they are prioritising \u201cprotecting\u201d people from the consequences of their free choices at the cost of endangering others. When people buy illegal drugs, they are choosing to put their wants ahead of other people\u2019s lives. There is no other policy area where governments visibly fail to achieve the stated aim of a policy \u2014 in this case, reducing the number of people who take illegal drugs \u2014 in a way that significantly increases human suffering (of people caught in the supply chain of those drugs) and where persisting with this policy is seen as hard-headed and sensible, and not doubling down on disaster.\n\nThe reality is that everyone involved in the global attempt to reduce the harms of drug usage through prohibition and punishment should be ashamed. Governments should be ashamed of a policy that hasn\u2019t worked and causes a great deal of suffering. Drug users should be ashamed of making a choice that they know full well causes suffering and misery. And those of us who want a shift in policy should be ashamed both that we have largely failed to change opinion and that we often hold back from pointing out how shamefully almost everyone involved in this whole sorry mess behaves.\n\nstephen.bush@ft.com\n\n\u200bLetters in response to this column:\n\nWar on drugs is the 21st century\u2019s big challenge\u00a0/\u00a0From Annette Idler, Associate Professor in Global Security, Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford, UK\n\nDrug demand among the professional classes is key / From Mike Davis, Antwerp, Belgium", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8ab25029-f9bf-4588-95a8-9e04aaf31931"}}, {"id": "fa480a0f-59c0-417b-90a7-1e6f160acbff", "event_name": "Santander could find ditching UK depositors is an uphill struggle", "blurb": "On top of finding a buyer, putting a laggard business up for sale will raise questions over the bank\u2019s \u2018core\u2019 markets model", "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0", "body": "Building a global retail bank is hard work. If Santander decides to pull out of the UK, it could find dismantling a global retail bank is no easier.\n\nThe Spanish banking group is considering the future of its British arm, built by rolling up former building societies like Abbey National in the 2000s. The frustrations are obvious: high costs, fairly low recent returns and slow growth.\n\nAt first glance, exiting the UK might seem as easy as cutting along the dotted line. Watchdogs already demand UK retail banks be legally ringfenced from international and investment banking operations. However, Santander has spent years working to centralise the back-end systems that power its different businesses. Attempted disentanglements at rivals like Deutsche Bank and Sabadell have run into problems.\n\nEven if boss Ana Bot\u00edn succeeds, she might find she has opened a Pandora\u2019s box that is hard to shut. Santander has always defended its business model \u2014 with retail banks in 10 \u201ccore\u201d markets \u2014 by arguing that markets going through temporary troubles are offset by stronger ones.\n\nThat has been vindicated in the past. At times in the 2010s, the UK was Santander\u2019s most profitable market, while its US business underperformed. In later years, though, the US reported higher profits than the bank\u2019s foundational Spanish division.\u00a0If Bot\u00edn is now of the view that laggard businesses should be put up for sale, it will be harder to dismiss demands for shrinking further.\n\nThen there\u2019s the challenge of finding a buyer. A combination with local UK rivals Barclays or NatWest would create the largest mortgage lender in the country, with more than 20 per cent market share. That would not be an encouraging development for regulators that have spent the last 15 years complaining that the UK banking sector is too concentrated.\n\nEither way, nothing will happen quickly. Look at rival Citigroup, which vowed in 2022 to divest its Mexican retail business Banamex. After failing to find a buyer at a reasonable price, chief executive Jane Fraser decided to list the business instead. Now she says that might take until 2026 \u2014 which will mark four years of trying to cut the division loose.\n\nIt makes sense that Bot\u00edn would be considering her options. Santander\u2019s share price has fallen 30 per cent since she succeeded her father as chair in 2014. If the latest deal talk flushes out a prospective buyer with an offer that is too good to refuse, the group would be remiss to ignore it. But backing out of Britain is no quick fix.\n\nnicholas.megaw@ft.com", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a83243e6-3066-40af-be78-257eda401009"}}, {"id": "bebf50a9-36e5-4bcc-8651-7e7f435492c3", "event_name": "Parkrun comes of age: six of its best international 5ks ", "blurb": "The free running event turns 21 this year \u2014 and its continuing global expansion makes it an excellent way to see another side of a city ", "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0", "body": "What does the perfect trip to a new city include? Perhaps finding a good caf\u00e9, meeting some locals and a spot of gentle exercise while taking in some sights away from the overcrowded tourist traps? What if I told you that you could do all of this, in around an hour? In 2,500 locations in more than 20 countries. For free.\n\nParkrun, the London-founded mass-participation 5k running event that turns 21 this year, is a compelling proposition for the exercise-keen but time-poor traveller. All you need is a spare Saturday morning, a pair of running shoes and a phone/watch-based \u201cbarcode\u201d, Parkrun\u2019s system for identifying you and recording your runs, wherever you may be.\n\nMuch of Parkrun\u2019s appeal lies in its fusion of a community-led core with a warm welcome for Parkrun tourists, whose home event might be hundreds or thousands of miles away.\n\nRelying strictly on volunteers for course set-up, marshalling and timekeeping, Parkrun insists the event will be \u201cfree forever\u201d. As crowdsourced events go, it\u2019s less \u201cgig economy\u201d, more \u201cjog economy\u201d \u2014 a model that has found favour with an increasingly international network of enthusiasts.\n\nInternational expansion has not been without issues. In response to the invasion of Ukraine, Parkrun suspended events across Russia in 2022 (prompting Russians to create their own copycat replacement).\n\nIn France, Parkruns have also been suspended since 2022 due to the French Athletics Federation requiring runners taking part in sporting activities to either be licensed or have completed an online safety course \u2014 something that Parkrun says would be impractical to enforce at its volunteer-led events.\n\nNevertheless, international Parkruns are an excellent way to see a different side to a city. In my experience, they tend to be smaller events than those in the UK, offering a more intimate mix of locals, expats and tourists.\n\nIn the US, home to more than 75 Parkrun events, I\u2019ve run on Roosevelt Island in Washington DC and at Boston\u2019s Jamaica Pond, each tucked far away from their respective city centres. In both locations, there was a warm welcome from locals clearly taking pride in attracting visitors to their events.\n\nWhile the experience was new, the logistics were reassuringly the same as at my local Parkrun: a first-timer\u2019s briefing to talk through the route, a welcome from the event director at the start and plenty of marshalls to guide and cheer runners along to the finish.\n\nParkrun 5k events always take place on a Saturday morning. For business travellers, if your schedule allows, it\u2019s a great way to sneak in some off-the-beaten-track tourism and flush out the remnants of jet lag at the same time. Many events start at 9am, though times vary internationally (clue: earlier start times are usually correlated with hotter climes). Always check an event\u2019s web page in addition to Parkrun\u2019s international cancellations page before setting out as events can be postponed at short notice due to weather or adverse course conditions.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s a timed run, not a race. Some of the best Parkruns are those where you take the time to enjoy the surroundings rather than seek a personal best. \u201cParkwalking\u201d \u2014 completing the course in a leisurely stroll \u2014 is increasingly popular, in South Africa accounting for nearly 30 per cent of those completing the event.\n\nThose seeking a more competitive angle will nevertheless enjoy tracking their efforts alongside their peers. Finishing times for all events are published online, along with an age-graded performance score, allowing for comparisons between young and old.\n\nHere are six Parkruns I\u2019ve picked from across FT Globetrotter\u2019s network of cities based on my own experience and enthusiastic reports from international runners.\n\nI\u2019ve picked the original event that started the Parkrun movement, but runners in the UK\u2019s capital are spoiled for choice \u2014 there are 65 events within Greater London. Complete them all and you have LonDone them. Bushy Park, which hosted the very first event of 13 runners in 2004, saw over 6,000 finishers for its 1,000th event in August 2024.\n\nFor many Parkrunners, completing Bushy Parkrun is a pilgrimage, as I found out\u2009on a frosty January morning this year. I joined more than 150 Bushy \u201cfirst-timers\u201d in a field of 1,345 runners for a bracing run through the park. It\u2019s flat, fast and beautiful throughout its single long lap \u2014 just keep an eye out for the deer that roam the park.\n\nVolkspark Niddatal is Frankfurt\u2019s largest green space with an abundance of trails through its open and wooded areas, making it an ideal setting for this flat, fast two-lap figure-of-eight course. The event is praised by business-trip Parkrunners for its warm welcome and English-language first timers briefing, and you can join locals afterwards in trying to hunt down the Mounir Coffee Trike that services the park.\n\nIn a similar vein to Frankfurt, Italy\u2019s largest Parkrun offers a largely flat, two-lap course in a park on the city\u2019s outskirts, this time the 640-hectare Parco Nord. Parkrun tourists report a warm welcome from locals, who\u2019ll happily chat with you over a coffee at Bar Enigma on Viale Giovanni Suzzani.\n\nOne of several Parkruns in the Greater Vancouver area. I\u2019ve picked this one in Burnaby because it\u2019s easily accessible by public transport and the route in a historical forest park is graced with native west North American tree species like western hemlock, and western red cedar. Another option is to head for the Spanish Banks Beach Parkrun, where a 2k walk to the start from the nearest bus station is followed by an out-and-back 5k on the waterfront gravel\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\n\nMelbourne \u2014 and Australia \u2014 is awash with Parkruns, so why not aim for something more adventurous? Bring your trail-running shoes to experience Brimbank\u2019s hills and bridges, noting the 8am start time. Well-earned post-run coffees are available at Lumbar & Co.\n\nThis course is around 25 minutes away from Tokyo Station, but again note the start time is 8am, the same as all the other 39 Parkruns in Japan. A classic \u201cpark\u201d route that involves one lap around a baseball field, followed by two larger laps of the park. Join locals for a post-run coffee at the park\u2019s charming shop/caf\u00e9.\n\nHave you done any Parkruns at home or abroad? Which are your favourites?

He is due to start next month as Britain\u2019s emissary to President Donald Trump.\n\nOne of the people said Mandelson was expected to put the shares, worth millions of pounds, in a \u201cblind trust\u201d to ensure compliance with UK government rules until they are sold off.\n\nThe former New Labour veteran, whom UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer selected over career diplomats, was the second-largest shareholder in Global Counsel with a 28 per cent stake as of June 2024, according to filings at UK Companies House. The people said his stake was smaller now.\n\nThe firm was valued at \u00a330mn last year when The Messina Group, the political consultancy founded by former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, bought a 20 per cent stake.\n\nNicknamed \u201cthe Prince of Darkness\u201d for his ability as a political operator, Mandelson was a controversial pick for the ambassador job.\n\nHe had previously called Trump a \u201cdanger to the world\u201d and \u201clittle short of a white nationalist\u201d. One of Trump\u2019s top campaign strategists called Mandelson \u201can absolute moron\u201d when his appointment was announced last month.\n\nThe 71-year-old was a minister in Sir Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour government but had to resign twice. He also served under Gordon Brown. Mandelson co-founded Global Counsel in 2010 and later served as president of the Great Britain-China Centre, an arm of the UK Foreign Office. In the past he has encouraged western governments to be pragmatic in dealing with China.\n\nIn a Fox News article last week, Mandelson praised Trump\u2019s \u201cgreat\u00a0skill\u201d as a campaigner and said Beijing \u201cnow directly challenges western governments and our values\u201d.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter said Mandelson\u2019s stake in Global Counsel had declined to about 20 per cent in the past few months. The firm\u2019s clients have included companies such as Anglo American, JPMorgan, OpenAI, Palantir and Sequoia \u2014 but also several China-linked companies.\n\nGlobal Counsel lobbied for TikTok in the UK between July and September last year, according to the British lobbying regulator. TikTok remains a client, according to a person familiar with Global Counsel\u2019s work.\n\nThe US has legislated to ban TikTok unless its owner ByteDance divests the company because of fears the app could be wielded by Beijing for espionage or to spread propaganda. TikTok has denied that it is under the influence of the Chinese government. Trump has said he is looking to allow TikTok to remain available to US users.\n\nGlobal Counsel until last year also advised fast-fashion group Shein, which was founded in China but is now based in Singapore, according to the person familiar with the firm\u2019s work.\n\nShein, which has been exploring a flotation in the UK, has faced allegations that minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour in cotton supply chains in China\u2019s Xinjiang region, some of which has made its way into Shein products. The company insists it complies with all laws and regulations of the countries in which it operates.\n\nMandelson in 2021 was the only Labour peer in the House of Lords to vote against an amendment aimed at calling out alleged genocide in Xinjiang province. He later told colleagues that having a \u201cgeneral genocide definition in the formulation of foreign policy\u201d could be too sweeping and leave the government with its hands tied.\n\nGlobal Counsel in 2020 also provided advice to Canyon Bridge, the person familiar with the firm\u2019s work said. Canyon Bridge is a US-based venture company backed by Chinese funds including China Reform Holdings, a Chinese state-owned venture fund. Its portfolio includes British graphics chipmaker Imagination Technologies.\n\nIn 2020 Canyon Bridge tried to appoint four China Reform-linked directors to Imagination\u2019s board but abandoned the move after an intervention by the UK government, the Financial Times previously reported.\n\nGlobal Counsel made a loss of \u00a31.85mn in 2023. Mandelson stepped down as a director in the wake of the deal with Messina but became president and chair of Global Counsel\u2019s international advisory board.\n\nMandelson and Global Counsel declined to comment.\u00a0Asked about Mandelson\u2019s links with China, Starmer\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe are confident that when President Trump comes to review his credentials he will come to see the considerable experience that Lord Mandelson has and why he would make an excellent ambassador.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f1648c4c-50aa-4cf2-a5c9-c0a5551cf06f"}}, {"id": "aa433840-21bc-41aa-b5cb-b63d6058f8b6", "event_name": "Rachel Reeves intervenes in UK car finance mis-selling case to protect lenders", "blurb": "Treasury approach to Supreme Court a blow to consumer groups but chancellor fears damage to sector", "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0", "body": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves on Monday launched a bid to shield car loan providers from multibillion-pound payouts in a landmark mis-selling case, after the Treasury warned it could damage Britain\u2019s reputation as a place to do business.\n\nThe Treasury has taken the unusual step of seeking permission to intervene in a forthcoming Supreme Court case, amid concerns that banks and other lenders could face a compensation bill costing tens of billions of pounds.\n\nReeves fears that the case could cause chaos in the motor finance and car industry, making it harder for consumers to get loans. About 80 per cent of new vehicles in the UK are bought on finance.\n\nIf the Treasury is successful, it will deal a blow to consumer groups and claims management companies that have been encouraging car finance customers to file complaints to the Financial Ombudsman.\n\nShares in Lloyds Banking Group and Close Brothers rose 4 per cent and 21.6 per cent respectively on Tuesday after the Financial Times reported the Treasury\u2019s attempt to intervene in the case.\n\nLloyds owns the country\u2019s largest car finance lender Black Horse. Close Brothers has the highest relative exposure to the sector and\u00a0has lost more than half of its market value over the past year.\n\n\u201cIn our view, there has been a clear sentiment change from both the regulator [Financial Conduct Authority] and the government on this topic in the last two months, with both institutions rallying behind the banks,\u201d said Benjamin Toms, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nReeves, who is at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week trying to drum up investment in Britain, fears the huge potential payouts would have a chilling effect on the banking sector, stunt growth and damage the UK\u2019s pro-business reputation, according to people close to the chancellor.\n\nSantander was reconsidering its presence in the UK, according to people familiar with the matter, as it contends with lower returns on its ringfenced business relative to other markets. In November, it set aside \u00a3295mn to cover the potential costs of mis-sold car loans.\n\nIn April, the Supreme Court is due to hear an appeal brought by car loan providers challenging an October ruling from the Court of Appeal that sided with consumers who complained about \u201csecret\u201d commissions on car loans.\n\nThe judgment that it was unlawful for banks to pay a commission to a car dealer without the customer\u2019s informed consent sent shockwaves through the UK banking system and triggered thousands of pounds in compensation payments from lenders FirstRand Bank and Close Brothers.\n\nHSBC analysts have estimated the total cost of compensation could reach \u00a344bn, echoing the \u00a350bn paid out by banks after the scandal of the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.\n\nIn a submission to the Supreme Court, seen by the Financial Times, the Treasury claims the case has \u201cpotential to cause considerable economic harm and could impact the availability and cost of motor finance for consumers\u201d.\n\nThe Treasury application said that the case might \u201cgenerate a perception that regulation in the UK is uncertain\u201d. Last week, Reeves called in regulators to push them into sweeping away rules that hinder growth.\n\nIt also argued that if liability was established, then the Treasury would seek to persuade the Supreme Court that \u201cany remedy should be proportionate to the loss actually suffered by the consumer and avoid conferring a windfall\u201d.\n\nTreasury officials argue that rather than taking sides with the banks against wronged consumers, the government wants to maintain the viability of a finance sector vital for the purchase of both new and second-hand cars.\n\n\u201cIf lenders have broken the law then consumers should receive compensation proportionate to the losses they have suffered,\u201d said one Reeves ally.\n\n\u201cHowever, the chancellor\u2019s concerned that the judgment risks using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. That would be bad for consumers and bad for the industry.\u201d\n\nJudges including Lord Reed, president of the Supreme Court, and his deputy Lord Hodge are due to hear the landmark case at the start of April.\n\nThe Supreme Court, which replaced the appellate committee of the House of Lords as the UK\u2019s highest court in 2009, permits official bodies to apply to intervene in cases it hears.\n\nPermission is granted only if the court thinks the intervention will offer \u201csignificant assistance\u201d to the judges who will hear the case.\n\nThe Treasury\u2019s move will be welcomed by UK lenders, which have held urgent talks with the government to warn of potential turmoil in the consumer credit sector. Part of the discussions have centred around the possibility that the government would introduce new legislation, said a person familiar with the debates.\n\nLloyds chief executive Charlie Nunn has also previously called on the government to step in as he warned that the October court ruling had fuelled an \u201cinvestability problem\u201d for the UK.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fcba5c39-b696-4e22-9f20-9654f2f40170"}}, {"id": "ed5d8c49-8197-4b7a-9611-81d02818d323", "event_name": "Rachel Reeves backs plans for looser limits on mortgage lending", "blurb": "UK chancellor favours proposals by financial regulator for banks to take more risks to boost home ownership", "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0", "body": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has backed plans by the UK financial watchdog to examine ways of allowing more mortgage risk-taking by banks to help more people own their own homes.\n\nThe chancellor told the Financial Times that she welcomed proposals from the Financial Conduct Authority to lift limits on mortgages and was \u201cabsolutely open to looking at ideas that can boost home ownership and help working families get on the housing ladder\u201d.\n\nReeves is heading to Davos this week to tout the UK as an investment destination at the World Economic Forum as the Labour government tries to bolster growth after the economy flatlined in the second half of last year.\n\nWith her self-imposed fiscal rules under pressure and business sentiment suffering following her decision in October\u2019s Budget to raise employer national insurance contributions, the chancellor has been under heavy political pressure since the start of the year.\n\nThe Treasury has been at the heart of the government\u2019s effort to push regulators to come up with growth-enhancing measures. Reeves met many of the UK\u2019s rulemakers last week to hear their ideas.\n\n\u201cMy greatest concern is we are regulated for risk whilst ignoring growth,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cWe need to make sure regulators are also taking into account the impact of their policies on growth \u2014 that is what we are determined to do as a reforming government.\u201d\n\nThe FCA said in its letter to the prime minister published on Friday that it would \u201cbegin simplifying responsible lending and advice rules for mortgages, supporting home ownership and opening a discussion on the balance between access to lending and levels of defaults\u201d.\n\nUK mortgage lending is controlled by a mixture of rules from the FCA and the Bank of England, most of which were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis when several banks had to be bailed out by the state.\n\nThe rules restrict how much banks can lend as a multiple of a person\u2019s income or the value of a property and require affordability tests to check if borrowers can cope with future interest rate rises.\n\n\u201cHome ownership declined under the last government and we are determined to turn that around,\u201d Reeves said, adding that the Treasury would \u201clook at the FCA\u2019s ideas in this area\u201d.\n\nThe proportion of households that owned their own accommodation fell from 64.3 per cent in 2011 to 62.5 per cent in 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nRichard Donnell, executive director at property portal Zoopla, said the \u201cbig hurdle\u201d preventing more people from getting a mortgage was the FCA\u2019s requirement to stress test affordability, which means banks have to test if borrowers can cope with a rise in borrowing costs.\n\nReeves has come under fire in recent weeks after leaving herself a slender \u00a39.9bn margin of error against her budget rule of funding day-to-day government spending from tax receipts by 2029/30. That margin is at risk of being erased by any renewed surge in bond yields.\n\nShe said the Budget had got the balance right when it came to headroom against her rule and that the forecast in March from the Office for Budget Responsibility would rely on a host of factors, not just bond yields.\n\nWhile global markets had experienced \u201cheadwinds\u201d, the fiscal rules remained \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d, Reeves added. That meant she would not be making any changes to the rules published at the time of the Budget, she added.\n\nAsked if she could rule out tax increases in March to ensure she met those rules, Reeves reiterated that \u201cwe are not having a Budget in March\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009my commitment to one fiscal event a year remains\u201d.\n\nReeves acknowledged that the Budget, which has been heavily criticised by business leaders for raising employer NI and wage costs, had involved taking \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d. But she insisted they were the right ones to get the economy back on a firm footing.\n\nShe had yet to hear a serious alternative to the measures, she said.\n\n\u201cJust imagine the alternative, if I hadn\u2019t made those difficult decisions to put the public finances on a firm footing, what that would have done to market confidence in Britain,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to deal with the inheritance I had. That meant making difficult decisions but they are right decisions to get our economy back on a firm footing.\u201d\n\nSpeaking before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as US president, Reeves said the fact that he was \u201cobviously a deals person\u201d made her hopeful that \u201cthere is scope\u201d to negotiate a trade deal with the new administration.\n\nWhile talks are yet to start, the chancellor said any trade deal with Washington \u201cwould have to be right for the UK\u201d, adding that Labour would not ditch its existing position barring imports of US chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-fed beef.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8356a66d-b1ad-4a67-8c7d-e97f4acc0098"}}, {"id": "24c69491-5735-4eae-b44a-2de5ecc8cc00", "event_name": "Plans to fit out 40 hospitals in England will run into next decade", "blurb": "Construction may not begin on some projects until 2039, says health secretary Wes Streeting", "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0", "body": "A flagship government programme to build or expand 40 hospitals in England has been delayed by at least a decade.

The New Hospital Programme, first announced by former Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson, aimed to build or expand 40 hospitals by 2030, backed by about \u00a322bn of capital funding.When it took office in July, Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour government announced it would review the scheme, which was already suffering delays due to a lack of funding.Setting out the new timetable on Monday, Streeting told MPs the building work would take place in four \u201cwaves\u201d and that nine schemes under the programme would not start construction until between 2035 and 2039.

Survivors and relatives of the victims were not in court to hear him plead guilty, as they had been expecting the trial to start in earnest on Tuesday.\n\nRiots erupted across the country in July after reports circulated online falsely identifying the perpetrator as an illegal immigrant or asylum seeker who had recently arrived in the country by boat.\n\nFar-right influencers and conspiracy theorists exploited public horror at the knife attack to whip up tensions and stoke anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\nRudakubana was born in Cardiff to parents who had emigrated from Rwanda. He was 17 at the time of the attack. Reporting restrictions originally prevented him from being named, but a judge lifted them to prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\nFor more than a week after the killings, sporadic violence continued to break out in towns and cities across England, including in Southport itself.\n\nA hundred miles away in Rotherham, a mob set fire to a hotel housing asylum seekers, barricading the windows and chanting racist abuse. In several areas, police officers were injured in the resulting violence.\n\nDozens of rioters have since been convicted of public order offences, some of them racially aggravated and some carried out online.\n\nRudakubana was initially charged with murder and attempted murder.\u00a0It was only three months after the attack \u2014 following what Merseyside Police said was a \u201clengthy and complex investigation\u201d \u2014 that he was charged with possession of ricin and the document.\n\nMerseyside\u2019s chief constable Serena Kennedy said at the time that \u201cmotivation\u201d would need to be established for a matter to be declared a terrorist incident.\n\nSouthport\u2019s Labour MP Patrick Hurley told the BBC that there was \u201csurprise and shock\u201d locally at Rudakubana\u2019s sudden guilty plea on Monday.\n\nThe town, and particularly those families close to the case, had been \u201cbracing\u201d themselves for several weeks of trial, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very pleased\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they\u2019re not going to be put through that mental torture now,\u201d he added.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/31b09602-63f2-49e1-b14c-7d5707da9a75"}}, {"id": "81f8cef1-1f92-4ef8-97de-bf2aa87a0683", "event_name": "Bank of England proposes \u2018concierge\u2019 service to welcome foreign firms", "blurb": "Prudential Regulation Authority has been studying rule changes that could boost growth ", "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0", "body": "The Bank of England said it is considering setting up a \u201cconcierge service\u201d to help foreign companies looking to establish a UK operation, as it responded to the government\u2019s request for growth-enhancing measures.\n\nThe central bank has been studying a similar service that is already offered by Singapore, Sam Woods, head of the BoE\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority, said in his letter to the prime minister published on Monday.\n\nThe government has called on the PRA and 16 other UK regulators to present ideas for rule changes that could increase risk-taking and investment in the economy.

Some of the things he has said since the election, not least his willingness to ride to the rescue of TikTok, may mean that some possible flashpoints, like the UK government\u2019s relatively meagre list of tariffs on China compared with its peers, are not as big a problem as thought.\n\nThe risk to the Conservatives and the Reform UK party is different and more complex. For Reform, it is that it is seen as close to the US president, and that it is pretty much maxed out when it comes to attracting \u201cBritish voters who like Donald Trump\u201d. The perception of proximity to Trump may be a help to Nigel Farage when it comes to raising money but hurt when it comes to winning people over. For Kemi Badenoch\u2019s Conservatives, on top of that, it all deepens the perception that her party is just a weak echo of Farage\u2019s Reform rather than having a distinctive pitch of its own.\n\nFor the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru the politics of this are rather easy: it\u2019s a way that they can criticise Labour for being insufficiently principled. I have a feeling that it is trickier for the Liberal Democrats: I think some of the voters they won from the Conservatives last time and some 2024 Tory voters who might be up for grabs care a bit about the Lib Dems looking \u201ccredible\u201d, ie having a foreign policy position that might actually be deliverable. That\u2019s the balance Ed Davey is trying to tread with positions such as his call for the UK to re-enter the customs union. It\u2019s difficult, but nowhere near as difficult as the one that Keir Starmer faces from now on.\n\nJoin my FT colleagues on Thursday at 1pm GMT for a free webinar on Trump\u2019s second term.

But if you\u2019re a Dylanologist you\u2019ll find it frustratingly shallow and even more so if you are also interested in Joan Baez or any of the substantial divides between these two musicians.

But before we can tuck in, the six of us seated together for dinner have an icebreaker to complete. After all, we\u2019re here to mingle as much as we are to eat.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s got a baby face under that beard,\u201d muses my fellow diner Jethro, who is sitting next to me at Dinner for One Hundred (known as D4100), a supper club by the eponymous London pizzeria chain. \u201cLet\u2019s say 22,\u201d a young TV producer opposite me replies as we try to determine who is the youngest staff member at the bar \u2014 the first set activity of the evening. The prospect of winning a free bottle of wine offers an instant incentive to bond and, at this dinner for singles, for once no one is reaching for their phones.\n\nThis event is part of a new wave of Gen Z-focused supper clubs popping up across London, as twentysomethings increasingly turn away from sticky dancefloors, bars and dating apps in favour of informal yet carefully curated gatherings hosted by their peers. A Gen Z spin on excellent food at fair prices blends the right ingredients of a dinner party with the spontaneity and excitement of forging connections on a night out.\n\nSupper clubs are a well-established and often affordable form of social dining, usually in the form of a themed ticketed dinner where participants find themselves surrounded by strangers and feast on specially designed menus.\u00a0They are believed to date back to 1930s California, where Lawrence Frank, the restaurateur behind the legendary steakhouse chain Lawry\u2019s Prime Rib, opened the first supper club in Beverly Hills to ring in the end of Prohibition. This cabaret-style dining boomed in popularity and glamour in the US until the 1960s, and only truly emerged across the Atlantic this century in the form of pop-ups at intimate or lesser-known venues and exclusive one-night dos with top chefs.\n\nNow, as twentysomethings \u2014 often dubbed the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d generation \u2014 ditch clubbing (around three nightclubs have closed each week in the UK since the start of 2024) and are increasingly health-conscious, supper clubs are becoming popular again, particularly with graduates of Covid-era university cohorts, who seek alternative ways to socialise away from partying.\n\nSome of London\u2019s most appealing Gen Z supper clubs rely on social media to connect with like-minded young diners looking to switch up their socialising habits. Online followers of supper-club communities or the emerging chefs involved in them will quickly snap up tickets in advance; some, such as D4100, sell out so rapidly that the organisers recommend setting reminders when tickets are due to be released.\n\nUsually communal-dining experiences, supper clubs are ideal for those hoping to broaden their social horizons. The concept struck me \u2014 a recent graduate newly moved to London \u2014 as a great way to meet new people with shared interests. The clubs I have tried, run by and designed for Gen Z, may be a fruitful starting point for anyone willing to step outside their comfort zone and form new and tangible connections.\n\nOne of the newest supper clubs and already among the most popular is The Candid Club. These stylish dinner parties are organised by two longtime friends: actor Jack Redmayne, 23, and online chef-influencer Kit Paterson, formerly of Manteca, 25. Each event pairs dinner with a fashion show, showcasing Paterson\u2019s cooking and new styles from Instagram-trending designers worn by a select number of models among the servers and guests.\n\nFashion and food are at the heart of their events. Paterson, who\u2019s known by his 77,000-plus TikTok followers for cooking up a feast, says the supper clubs are more than an opportunity to create the evening\u2019s cuisine: \u201cFor [Candid Club diners] to actually eat the food they see online [on his account], and to see the clothes from designers that they scroll past online, I think that\u2019s a pretty great experience.\u201d\n\nAt this, the third instalment of The Candid Club, my fellow diners and I are welcomed to legendary rock-star haunt the Columbia Hotel, which has hosted artists and bands on the road from Iggy Pop and Amy Winehouse to Stereophonics and Oasis. \u201cThis is much more my scene,\u201d says writer, actor and producer Lucy Nicholson, 28, who was drawn to The Candid Club after hosting many dinner parties at home. Swapping host for guest is a refreshing change: \u201cI like to actually speak to people.\u201d\n\nRedmayne, who acts as MC for the evening, makes an announcement before the arrival of the appetisers \u2014 dainty plates of whipped ricotta and autumn squash.\u00a0\u201cAfter the starters is the fashion show,\u201d says Redmayne, to which the crowd enthusiastically cheers. \u201cSo try not to smoke between the starter and the main or you\u2019ll miss out.\u201d\n\nFollowing the first course, a stream of model-servers begin to waft plates of chicken thighs and cannellini beans down the catwalk, a narrow passageway between the two long tables lining the Windsor Suite. It\u2019s a theatrical moment that gives our table some amusement, while being an innovative way to offer live entertainment between courses.\n\nCameras are raised instantly by guests to snap away at the latest designs \u2014 and our dishes \u2014 sported by the models. In the line-up is the slick tailoring from Soho staple Wax London menswear and young designer Chloe St John\u2019s slow-fashion label Alchemy London, which is taking Instagram by storm with cool-girl chic suits.\n\nThis year the Candid Club has planned a large-scale dinner for each season of the fashion calendar. Its next event promises to be another hit, solidifying its place as the go-to soir\u00e9e for cuisine \u00e0 la mode and high spirits.\n\nHosting dinners, workshops and talks, 2sday Supper Club is a bi-monthly community event typically at east London\u2019s coolest caf\u00e9s and lounges. It prides itself on being a space for young women to create and collaborate. Each event, whether a supper club, open-decks night or pop-up exhibition, provides a platform for informal networking. According to American co-founders Hannah Reznik, 22, fashion marketing student and model scout, and Sofia Wimberly, 21, who works in marketing and social media consulting, half of the diners at each event are new to 2sday. Their gatherings of around 30 to 50 young women aim to appeal to solo diners, as well as creatives looking to make connections.\n\nThe 2sday creators didn\u2019t intend it to be female-focused, but they found it was a natural incentive for their events. \u201cIt was just easier to connect on a one-on-one basis with other women\u201d says Wimberly. \u201cWe want to make this a space for women in these communities.\u201d\n\nThe duo behind the club met about 18 months ago as neighbours in London, quickly bonding over the communal gatherings of family and friends from their US hometowns.\n\nOn my visit, Bread and Butter Lounge, nestled in a Shoreditch side street, is the temporary home for a Day of the Dead-themed 2sday event. The narrow dining area is decked out in cobwebs and garlands, and each spot is soon filled as young women arrive through the doorway.\n\nEach supper club highlights up-and-coming young female chefs, and when I attend the kitchen is powered by 25-year-old Hannah Herrmann of Manteca, Crispin chef Ella Williams, 23, and sous-chef Lola Pond-Jones, 22.\n\n\u201cLondon can be a lonely place \u2014 you have to figure out how to build a life here,\u201d says social media manager Devyn Molina, 29, a can of Sagrado Blanco in hand. Originally from California, Devyn has been a regular at 2sday since finding it last summer on Instagram. Our table is quickly drawn into discussion over our experiences of socialising in London. The consensus is that with remote working and the onslaught of social media platforms prioritising online relationships, it\u2019s hard for Gen Z to branch out and form new friendships organically \u2014 and in person.\n\nThe starters are whisked along the tables by Reznik, Wimberly and the kitchen team \u2014 tortilla chips with an assortment of salsas (the most popular being a sweet-and-sour burnt pineapple), crispy plantain bites garnished with fennel leaves and salted, smoky Padr\u00f3n peppers topped with wedges of lime.\n\nMy table-neighbour Molina and I share a creamy horchata ice cream for dessert, which has a hint of sweetness from dried rose petals and a candied pecan garnish. Splitting it fittingly encapsulates the communal spirit the co-founders sought to create with 2sday.\n\nD4100 began in 2020 as multigenerational dinner in a Hackney warehouse, with 20 per cent of tickets reserved for free for elderly neighbours. It was an attempt to combat loneliness in all age groups, and with 100 invitees the dinner became the club\u2019s namesake. Then Covid-19 hit. D4100 was reborn\u00a0as a pizzeria every Friday in\u00a0co-founder Jacob Stuttard\u2019s mum\u2019s front garden, using a portable oven. It grew into three pizzerias including Bar D4100 in Nunhead, south London, which started hosting a regular series of dinners and bar events.\n\nStuttard, 29, and co-founder Jake Bucknall, 28, quickly saw a pattern in peers pairing off at the end of the night. Disillusioned with dating apps and attuned to the continued repercussions of their generation\u2019s isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic, from February 2023 onwards they tapped into dating events. The hosts have since brought together singles across themed evenings at Bar D4100 or at one-off locations such as the Hoxton Hotel.\n\nThe singles supper club is now its most popular events concept. Those aimed at 20-to-30-year-olds have the biggest take-up, with their 30-40s dinners a \u201cclose second\u201d and an emerging crowd of 40-50s diners. \u201cIn that [20\u201330s] age range,\u201d explains Bucknall, \u201cthere\u2019s never really been anything other than dating apps.\u201d\n\nI attend an event in their Nunhead restaurant. As I enter the small bar-pizzeria, Bucknall greets me and my guest (bringing a single male friend was a requirement to even out numbers) and points us towards our seats. In musical-chairs fashion, these are assigned differently for each course of pizza, with the 50 or so diners herded outside during the reshuffle in a form of culinary speed dating.\n\nMixing people up is key to sparking chemistry, and the low-lit tables of four to eight offer multiple chances to strike up a conversation. For most people here, it\u2019s their first foray into D4100 or indeed any singles event.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re there to matchmake,\u201d says Stuttard. \u201cSo it\u2019s all about rhythm, pace and energy.\u201d Stuttard juggles and Bucknall acts as a general-knowledge quiz master, keeping the atmosphere light while dishing out frequent generous rounds of pizza (such as the bestselling The MacGyver: hot honey, whipped feta, Spanish chorizo and crushed fennel seed) fresh from an enormous pink-dome oven.\n\nDespite the success of D4100, the duo recognise the heteronormative limitations of a male-female dinner-party model. They\u2019re now working with queer-event organisers to make D4100 more inclusive.\n\nD4100 is a testament to modern dating, where the swarm of apps and situationships make long-term romance less of a guarantee. \u201cIn the early days we used to say that if you come to a Dinner for One Hundred event, you might meet the love of your life,\u201d says Jacob. But anything can happen: \u201cWe don\u2019t say that any more. We now say everything\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nHave you tried one of London\u2019s Gen Z supper clubs?

Ding herself lives in one of the luxury apartments, court filings say.\n\nJudges in London and Hong Kong last year granted injunctions that froze Ding\u2019s assets worldwide, after liquidators were appointed to recoup funds for Evergrande investors. JLL told a London court it was no longer willing to manage the properties unless it was made clear that it had permission to, filings show, a case it has now won.\n\nThe lawsuit provides a rare window into the normally discreet dealings between property groups such as JLL and wealthy overseas clients looking to stash their funds in centres such as London. JLL employs more than 100,000 people worldwide in businesses ranging from facilities management to advising on multibillion-dollar commercial real estate deals.\n\nCourt filings by Evergrande\u2019s liquidators say Ding is \u201camongst the principal beneficiaries\u201d of \u201cwhat is understood to be the largest financial fraud to have emerged from mainland China\u201d.\n\nJLL and Ding declined to comment.\n\nThe liquidators, Alvarez & Marsal restructuring specialists Eddie Middleton and Tiffany Wong, were appointed a year ago when a Hong Kong judge ordered the winding-up of Evergrande\u2019s holding company, listed in the territory.\n\nThey are racing to lay claim to and sell off assets around the world that may enable them to hand money back to creditors.

This was four basis points higher than the peak reached on September 27 2022, when Liz Truss was prime minister. The UK is probably not heading for a borrowing crisis. But its position is fragile. The government must reinforce confidence in the soundness of the UK and its own good sense.\n\nInterest rates have risen across the G7. Even in Germany, the yield on the ultra-long 30-year Bund rose by 290 basis points between January 15 2021 and January 15 2025. In the US, the rise was 300 basis points, and in France 350 points. Alas, the rise in UK yields was the highest in the G7, at 440 basis points. UK yields\u00a0on 30-year gilts reached 5.2 per cent in mid-January. This was the highest level in the G7, while German yields were only 2.8 per cent and French ones still only 3.9 per cent. But US yields were not so far behind UK levels, at 4.9 per cent, probably because of the huge structural fiscal deficits in the global economic superpower.\n\nIn sum, UK yields on long-term debt have risen by more and reached higher levels than in peer countries. Yields on 30-year gilts were even 56 basis points higher than Italy\u2019s on January 15. Moreover, while UK yields had risen 78 basis points in the previous year, Italy\u2019s did not rise at all. That is embarrassing.\n\nA crucial question is why rates have risen. The big change has been in the real rate of interest, not inflation expectations. In the UK case, we have reasonably robust measures of both, from yields on index-linked and conventional gilts. The difference between the two indicates inflation expectations and perceptions of inflation risk.\n\nThese data show that real interest rates in the UK have jumped from a trough of -3.4 in early December 2021 to a peak of 1.3 per cent on January 14 2025. One might describe this as normalisation after a period of ultra-depressed real rates. The jump in real interest rates largely matches the rise in the yield on conventional gilts, which suggests that changes in inflation expectations have been surprisingly small.\n\nSo, what do these real and nominal yields tell one about the stability of UK public debt? If the ratio of debt to GDP is to be stabilised when the real rate of interest exceeds the growth rate of the economy, the government needs to run a primary fiscal surplus (balance between revenue and spending before interest payments). A real rate of 1.3 per cent allows a modest primary deficit if growth is consistently higher than that. IMF data show that this was precisely the trend rate of growth of the UK between 2007 and 2024. So, debt stability requires consistent primary balances. Happily, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s analysis of the October Budget, the primary budget is forecast to move into a surplus of a little under 1 per cent of GDP in the last three years of this decade. This would be consistent with rough stability of the ratio of net debt to GDP, as the OBR shows in its debt forecasts.\n\nThe implication is that the situation is manageable. Yet there are risks. One is that global real and nominal interest rates could shoot up further, perhaps because of further jumps in spending on investment or defence, or increased awareness of a host of political, monetary and financial risks. A UK-specific fragility is that the country runs persistent capital account surpluses, which make it highly dependent on foreign funding, unlike, say, Japan. This is also true for the US. But the latter is the prime borrower for the rest of the world.\n\nAnother risk for the UK is that GDP growth, already low, might slow even further. The politics of running primary fiscal surpluses might then become impossible. Yet another risk is that the ratio of net debt to GDP is already close to 100 per cent. This is hardly low. Comfortingly, it is below the levels in Japan, Italy, France and the US. But it is far higher than it was two decades ago. Finally, there is \u201cTrump risk\u201d, particularly threats of high tariffs against an open economy no longer inside the EU.\n\nIn brief, the UK\u2019s situation is fragile. The government needs to retain the confidence of its creditors. It is crucial not to adopt policies that raise doubts about its good sense. How taxes were raised in the Budget did just that. So, too, do regulatory developments, notably in the labour market. The government will have to toughen its stance on current spending in its coming review or consider higher taxes.\n\nThe UK must focus on resilience and growth. Panic is unnecessary, but the era of cheap borrowing is over. Policy has to respond.\n\nmartin.wolf@ft.com\n\nFollow Martin Wolf with\u00a0myFT and on\u00a0Twitter", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2890d3db-8bd1-4115-ba8a-612286123130"}}, {"id": "878fd7e9-db24-4337-b0ed-dfede0f7ce6e", "event_name": "UK\u2019s labour market tsar calls for crackdown on bogus self-employment", "blurb": "\u2018More urgency\u2019 needed on workers\u2019 rights and resourcing of new fair work agency, says Margaret Beels", "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0", "body": "The UK government needs to act to stop sham self-employment if it wants its flagship overhaul of workers\u2019 rights to succeed, warned the official charged with tackling labour exploitation.\n\nMargaret Beels, the independent director of labour market enforcement, told the Financial Times in an interview that employers could simply sidestep new obligations to their staff if ministers continued to delay legislation to clarify workers\u2019 status.\n\n\u201cI would like to see a bit more urgency\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009You can consult until the cows come home, but sometimes government just needs to take decisions,\u201d said Beels, echoing concerns raised by unions and business groups about the omission of a critical set of measures from the employment rights bill.\n\nThe bill, introduced to parliament last year, encompasses a sweeping set of reforms to give UK workers more security. But it does not tackle an issue Labour had previously promised to address: the potential for employers to exploit the ambiguities in UK law over workers\u2019 status.\n\nInstead, the government said it would need to consult at length on how to create a simpler framework, with a single status of worker and a clear distinction between the employed and self-employed.\n\nBeels said there was a risk that leaving this issue until later would allow employers to shirk their new responsibilities by hiring gig workers.\n\nThe UK is unusual in having three types of employment status: employees, self-employment and an in-between category of \u201climb (b)\u201d workers, and it is often difficult to establish how people should be treated.\n\nWorkers in the third group have more protection than the self-employed but lack some important employee rights that the Labour government plans to strengthen through the ERB, such as statutory sick pay, redundancy rights and protection against unfair dismissal.\n\nCrucially, they are treated as self-employed for tax purposes, creating a big incentive for businesses to use contractors in place of employees, especially after the \u00a325bn Budget increase in employers\u2019 national insurance.\n\nBut a rise in bogus self-employment is just one of the risks Beels sees looming, as the government enshrines new rights in law without yet specifying how much money will be made available to enforce them.\n\nThe complexity of UK hiring practices, where workers could be recruited by one agency, employed by another and told what to do by someone else, made it hard for individuals to enforce their rights, Beels said.\n\nBut the UK\u2019s thinly resourced enforcement agencies struggle to enforce existing labour market rules. The three main bodies \u2014 HM Revenue & Customs\u2019 minimum wage enforcement team, the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, and the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate \u2014 are set to be merged into a new Fair Work Agency, with a wider remit.\n\nBeels\u2019 role was created by the previous Conservative government to improve co-ordination between the agencies, set their strategy and prepare for this merger.\n\nIt proved a frustrating task, she acknowledged, as ministers repeatedly failed to follow through on the commitment to create a single body.\n\n\u201cI described myself as a sort of John the Baptist figure, saying prepare the way, this great thing is coming\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and it never came,\u201d said Beels, a former chair of the GLAA and former director of Scottish Gas.\n\nThe Fair Work Agency is now taking shape under Labour, and Beels, whose own office will be disbanded when the agency is created, is intent on making it a success.\n\nBoosting its profile will be crucial. \u201cTransparency is really important\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009workers knowing what the agency is doing and how effective it is,\u201d she said.\n\nEven without new funding, the creation of a single enforcement body would make it possible to allocate resources more effectively, she insisted.\n\nFunding for all three agencies totalled little more than \u00a340mn in 2023-24 \u2014 of which \u00a331.2mn was for HMRC\u2019s minimum wage team.

The firm is targeting a 40 per cent female equity partnership by this year, with data from last year showing that only 28 per cent of partners in the country were women.\n\nAudit firms have stepped up the number of women in top jobs in recent years, with EY recently naming Janet Truncale as its new global chair and appointing Anna Anthony as the UK firm\u2019s new managing partner.\n\nBut raising the gender balance of partnerships towards parity has proved to be a slow process, a phenomenon echoed in sectors such as law and banking.\n\nThe Big Four have all set goals in recent years to increase their proportions of female partners and, in turn, help to reduce their gender pay gaps, with women tending to account for less than a fifth of that rank in the UK towards the end of the 2010s.\n\nPwC is 3 percentage points shy of its 2025 goal of a 30 per cent UK female partnership according to its most recent data. The figure has increased by 1 to 2 percentage points per year since 2021, meaning it would require a bigger leap forward to close the gap before PwC reports its new figures later this year.\n\nKPMG and Deloitte have already met their own targets in the UK. The former was the first of the Big Four to publish gender diversity data just over a decade ago, and surpassed an interim 25 per cent goal in 2022. It had a 29 per cent female partnership in the UK in 2023.\n\nAnd Deloitte reported last year that 30 per cent of its partners were women, ahead of its 2025 deadline to hit that figure.\n\nHowever both firms are on track to miss global partnership targets \u2014 goals that PwC and EY do not have.\n\nThe Big Four have argued that boosting the number of female partners takes time, owing to the need to build a pipeline of candidates with sufficient experience to be promoted.\n\nKarl Edge, chief people officer at KPMG UK, said the firm was \u201ccommitted to creating an inclusive environment\u201d, adding: \u201cWhile progress may fluctuate, we\u2019re focused on reaching better representation across all levels of our firm, challenging ourselves to go further and faster.\u201d\n\nKPMG International said it would \u201ccontinue to build on the momentum\u201d for gender equality, which remains \u201ca strategic priority\u201d.\n\nJackie Henry, managing partner for people and purpose at Deloitte UK, said the firm was \u201cproud\u201d of meeting its 2025 target a year early. \u201cBut\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we will continue to hold ourselves accountable and to strive for greater gender equality.\u201d\n\nEY and PwC declined to comment.\n\n\u200bLetter in response to this article:\n\nGender parity should be a business reality not just an aspiration\u00a0/\u00a0From Professor Geeta Nargund, Chair, The Pipeline, London W1, UK", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/aecaf91e-2c3f-439b-b2bc-0902b1eae9ec"}}, {"id": "5d41e87c-981c-49fb-b9f6-83bf42d786d7", "event_name": "UK\u2019s \u2018Office for Value for Money\u2019 may not actually save cash, MPs warn", "blurb": "Committee demands transparency on costs and delivery of the new efficiency unit ", "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0", "body": "An influential select committee of MPs has questioned whether the UK government\u2019s new Office for Value for Money represents good value for money for taxpayers, calling it a \u201cred herring\u201d.\n\nThe cost-saving unit was set up by chancellor Rachel Reeves to ensure sensible spending decisions.

They then risked big income losses if they went back to a job that did not work out, it added.\n\nNew claims for incapacity benefit have not risen enough to explain the rise in the number of recipients. This is mostly due to the fact that a higher share of claims are approved and fewer people withdraw or leave the system after a reassessment.\n\nThe committee said the process for assessing claims needed to be more rigorous, but the government also needed to give people more support to return to work, and ensure they did not lose by accepting a job.\n\nIt would need to reform both unemployment and incapacity benefits, because of the interaction between the two, Bridges said, potentially easing the jobless benefits criteria while tightening sickness benefits.\n\nSome of the committee\u2019s recommendations are similar to proposals by the previous work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride, which have not been implemented, partly because of a legal challenge to the consultation process.\n\nA government spokesperson said it was \u201cdetermined to get Britain working again\u201d, had set out first steps to boost employment already and would consult on reforms to health and disability benefits in the spring.\n\n\u201cWe have been clear that the current welfare system needs reform, so it is fairer on the taxpayer and people get the support they need,\u201d they added.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6de11897-08a9-4a3f-b5bf-9122e2067879"}}, {"id": "cf431841-bc2b-4448-a91e-bbf4e3fd10ea", "event_name": "Faster UK growth tied to boosting export services in South East, data shows", "blurb": "Labour to face tough choices as north-south wage gap persists, say analysts ", "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0", "body": "Labour will have to focus heavily on developing service exports to deliver faster economic growth, according to an analysis that warns that the UK\u2019s Northern regions continue to lag far behind the more prosperous South East.\n\nThe potential for increasing productivity and wages is heavily skewed towards the South East, driven by exporting activity in high-value services such as IT and finance, the Centre for Cities think-tank said on Monday.\n\n\u201cIf we build more in London and the Greater South East we know that will have a positive growth effect, even though politics makes that difficult,\u201d said Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities.\n\nHe added that making it easier to build in existing prosperous areas was one of the fastest routes to growth.\n\nLabour has pledged to invest in all regions as part of its forthcoming industrial strategy, alongside plans to expand English devolution and empower local mayors.\n\nThe government\u2019s industrial strategy green paper describes narrowing the gap between the South East and other regions as \u201ckey\u201d to raising growth overall, with advanced manufacturing identified as a target sector.\n\nHowever, Tony Travers, professor in the government department at the London School of Economics, said Labour would need to make hard choices if it wanted to deliver rapid improvements to GDP.\n\n\u201cThe government has sold itself on kick-starting growth, but this analysis underlines just how dependent they are on London and the South East to achieve that goal.

The UK\u2019s creative industries are vital to the economy. Valued at \u00a3124bn, they are worth more than the life sciences, aerospace and automotive industries combined. Arts and culture alone contribute an impressive \u00a334.6bn.\n\nBeyond the economic value, the subsidised arts sector nurtures creative and technical talent and creates new intellectual property. Award-winning creators like Sam Mendes, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Stephen Daldry honed their craft in the subsidised sector before generating billions through global franchises like James Bond and The Crown.\n\nYet this critical element of our creative ecosystem is in crisis. According to a 2024 report by the University of Warwick and Campaign for the Arts, the government\u2019s core cultural funding dropped by 18 per cent between 2009 and 2023. Arts Council England funding also decreased by 18 per cent, and local government funding in England fell by 48 per cent. A 2023 analysis of 2,800 arts organisations showed a combined deficit of \u00a3117.8mn \u2014 the worst financial position in five years.\n\nA renewed funding model is needed \u2014 with state investment at its heart. One compelling solution could lie in France\u2019s Aillagon law.\n\nIntroduced in 2003 by then culture minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon, this policy incentivises corporate philanthropy for arts and charities by offering a 60 per cent tax relief on donations, capped at 0.5 per cent of a company\u2019s annual turnover. The law has transformed France\u2019s cultural funding, with the overall volume of declared patronage increasing from \u20ac1bn in 2004 to nearly \u20ac4bn in 2018.\n\nCorporate philanthropy is now embedded in France\u2019s creative ecosystem. In 2017 the Louvre was generating \u20ac12mn annually from the Aillagon law. Versailles raised \u20ac10mn and the Centre Pompidou \u20ac5mn. Most strikingly, in 2019, France raised \u20ac850mn within 72 hours to rebuild Notre-Dame cathedral thanks to corporate generosity nurtured by the Aillagon law.\n\nBy contrast, the UK\u2019s corporate sector remains an untapped resource for arts funding. Over the past decade, FTSE 100 charitable donations fell by 34 per cent. True, there are some visionary, committed sponsors of the arts. But 70 per cent of commercial sponsorship goes to sports, not the arts.\n\nA UK version of the Aillagon law could catalyse private investment in the arts. By offering tax incentives for corporate donors, the government could encourage the business sector to step in where public funding falls short.\n\nCritics of the Aillagon law argue that generous tax breaks shift a lot of the burden of donations on to taxpayers. However, this overlooks the broader benefits. A thriving cultural sector develops new intellectual property and supports jobs, tourism and innovation, while fostering community cohesion and national identity.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about the money. It\u2019s about stimulating collaboration between culture and commerce \u2014 much needed, given current arts sponsorship protests, which risk making sponsors think twice about aligning with the arts.\n\nFrance\u2019s Aillagon law demonstrates how visionary policy can transform cultural funding. It\u2019s more than a fiscal mechanism. It\u2019s a catalyst for cultural vitality and corporate engagement, while reducing reliance on dwindling public funds.\n\nGiven the state of the nation\u2019s finances, the UK government must match its commitment to support the arts with bold action.

There is a moment to say\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009let\u2019s revisit this,\u201d said Craig Beaumont, executive director at the Federation of Small Businesses.\n\nThe CBI business group has said ministers are nearing a \u201ccrunch moment\u201d, where they can bring forward government-backed amendments to alter parts of the bill that could otherwise have unintended consequences for workers.\n\nMinisters are looking at changes to address concerns that some of the measures could place burdens on business that were never intended, without benefiting workers, according to the two government figures.\n\nOne change would be to ensure big employers did not have to consult workers on redundancies at different sites if they were unrelated, so businesses were not \u201cstuck endlessly consulting on small changes\u201d.\n\nOfficials said secondary legislation would address another concern that a new duty to compensate workers for shifts cancelled at short notice might apply when employers were simply checking who might fill a gap in their rota.\n\nBut there is no sign yet that ministers will be receptive to bigger demands to revisit the principles underpinning the bill or rewrite key provisions.\n\nThe CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce and manufacturers\u2019 group Make UK all fear the bill will hand too much power to trade unions, significantly lowering hurdles for winning collective bargaining rights and taking strike action.\n\nThey also say a clampdown on contentious \u201cfire and rehire\u201d practices goes too far, obliging businesses to be on the point of insolvency before they can force through any changes to contracts.\n\nThe business groups want a rethink of new protections for zero-hours contract workers, arguing that employers should be obliged to meet requests for a contract that reflects regular working patterns, but not to offer one to all those potentially eligible.\n\nThe FSB is also challenging one of the bill\u2019s key provisions: the right to protection from day one against unfair dismissal. It maintains that even with provisions allowing for probation periods, employers will not have enough protection against vexatious claims that could take years to come to a tribunal.\n\nChanges to the primary legislation in these four areas would be big concessions that would be strongly opposed by unions.\n\nHowever, the effect of many measures will depend on details of their implementation, which are to be set out later in regulations. Business lobbyists hope to soften the impact of key measures, including the so-called ban on zero-hours contracts.\n\nOne question yet to be settled is how long a \u201creference period\u201d is needed to establish workers\u2019 entitlement to regular hours when moving from a zero-hours contract.\n\nBusiness groups say the 12-week period suggested is not long enough to allow for seasonal fluctuations. The CBI wants a year\u2019s data to be used where available, while others advocate six months.\n\nGovernment officials are considering ways to keep the headline 12-week figure while allowing employers to factor in peaks and troughs owing to weather or holiday periods.\n\nA bigger sticking point is the government\u2019s resolve to extend the ban on zero-hours contracts to agency workers.\n\nNeil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, said both options consulted on by ministers to achieve this goal were unworkable.\n\n\u201cThe government have a goal of 80 per cent employment,\u201d he told a parliamentary committee this week. \u201cI have to tell you right now that is not going that well in the labour market.\u201d\n\nThe Department for Business and Trade said the employment rights bill was \u201ca crucial part\u201d of the government\u2019s \u201cmission to grow the economy\u201d.\n\nThe department added that it had \u201calready engaged extensively with businesses and unions\u201d and \u201clook[ed] forward to more engagement and consultation in the coming months to ensure the bill works for workers and employers alike\u201d.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7330cdd9-7dd8-4f35-8993-0445fcb288a4"}}, {"id": "ef34a8b6-06b4-42fb-8b7c-7fd8c557ade8", "event_name": "Has business activity picked up in Europe?", "blurb": "Market Questions is the FT\u2019s guide to the week ahead", "date": "2025-01-1900:00:00.0", "body": "Data on Friday will offer a snapshot of business activity in Europe ahead of this month\u2019s European Central Bank meeting to set interest rates.\n\nThe January reading for the IHS Markit composite purchasing managers\u2019 index \u2014 which combines manufacturing and services activity \u2014 will be closely watched, analysts said, as it comes before the inauguration of Donald Trump.

A consensus of analysts expects a reading of 49.7, below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Even so, that would mark a slight improvement on December\u2019s reading of 49.6.\n\nThe data is likely to be an important input for policymakers at the ECB meeting at the end of the month. In December its governing council members became more vocal over the outlook for growth in the bloc, in addition to the uncertainty over the trade policies of the incoming Trump administration.

Gilt yields, which rose sharply earlier this month, dropped this week as traders bet that the central bank will cut interest rates more aggressively to kick-start growth.\n\nPhilip Shaw, economist at Investec, also forecast a 5.5 per cent rise for earnings, but said that wage increases were unlikely to derail the BoE from making another rate cut in February, from its current level of 4.75 per cent. \u201cGradually dialling back policy restraint seems warranted given subpar growth and receding inflation,\u201d he noted.\n\nFurthermore the Bank has also shown signs that it might play down the expected rise in wages in the official data. In December, it acknowledged the pick-up in wage growth but said that official earning growth \u201chad tended to be more volatile than other wage indicators\u201d.

In recent months the number has underscored the robustness of the US economy. Last month the \u201cflash\u201d PMI estimates rose to 56.6, a 33-month high, although it was later revised to 55.4. A reading above 50 signals growth.\n\nBut another strong reading in January would probably deepen concerns among traders that the Fed will cool on planned rate cuts.\n\nEarlier this month, better than expected December payrolls figures sent Treasury yields lurching higher, as traders trimmed their bets on the number of rate cuts this year. Days later, weaker-than-anticipated inflation data prompted a rethink \u2014 sparking a rally in government debt and stocks, as rate cut bets were cranked up again.\u201cThe market is still wary of the incoming administration\u2019s policies especially around tariffs and tax cuts which could help to stoke inflation,\u201d said John Kerschner, head of US securitised products and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, shortly after that consumer price index reading.However, the latest \u201cinflation numbers go a long way to giving the market confidence that Fed policy is on target\u201d, he added. \u201cPerhaps most importantly, the market is relieved that potential nosebleed interest rates are, for now, taken off the table.\u201d Harriet Clarfelt", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/055a173c-3dee-491c-b518-91dc7d403cfd"}}, {"id": "f4bccc96-0e52-49b8-8655-f0d323b9d480", "event_name": "Severance spending at top UK universities surges", "blurb": "FT analysis shows drop-off in overseas enrolments pushed redundancy payouts up by more than a fifth in 2024", "date": "2025-01-1900:00:00.0", "body": "More than a third of elite UK universities were forced to make further staff cuts last year, while severance spending across the Russell Group rose by more than a fifth, according to Financial Times analysis.\n\nTen of the 24 universities in the group said they ran voluntary severance schemes in 2024, offering staff compensation packages in exchange for taking voluntary redundancy.\n\nPayouts for staff redundancies rose after a sharp drop-off in lucrative foreign students.

They receive the same direct government funding as state-maintained schools, but have greater flexibility in how they operate.\n\nThe number of academy schools expanded rapidly after 2010, when successive coalition and Conservative governments passed laws to encourage \u201cacademisation\u201d. Over half of all schools in England are now academies.\n\nThe Children\u2019s Wellbeing and Schools Bill tries to make good on Labour\u2019s manifesto commitment to \u201cmeet the needs of all children\u201d by addressing the growing attainment gap between poorer and better-off students.\n\nCurrently academy schools can hire people who do not have qualified teacher status if they complete a one-year course that confirms they have met government standards, and schools can diverge from the national curriculum at their discretion.\n\nThe legislation will mean that academy schools must only employ people with qualified teacher status, will be legally required to follow the national curriculum, and will become part of the national framework on teacher pay and conditions.\n\nLocal councils will also receive powers to force academies to admit children, and to issue compliance orders to academies that are \u201cacting unreasonably\u201d, for example over admissions or imposing uniform requirements that are unaffordable for poorer families.\n\nThe act also rescinds a 2016 law that legally obliged all schools rated \u201cinadequate\u201d by the Ofsted school inspections to become academies. This will now become discretionary.\n\nThat depends who you ask. Education experts say the reforms are less radical than the promises in Labour\u2019s 2017 and 2019 manifestos to bring academies back under the full control of local authorities.\n\nJon Andrews, head of analysis at the Education Policy Institute think-tank, said the proposals are \u201creasonably measured\u201d compared to what might have been. \u201cThe legislation implicitly recognises academies are now part of the system and makes some relatively small changes,\u201d he added.\n\nTeaching unions have praised the changes.

Leora Cruddas, the chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, the main academy lobby group, argued removing flexibilities over pay and working practices was particularly damaging.\n\n\u201cIf this legislation is implemented in the way it is currently drafted it would be a significant retrograde step,\u201d she said.\n\nTory leader Kemi Badenoch described the proposed changes to the school system as \u201cworse than garbage\u201d and \u201cpure vandalism\u201d in a speech on Thursday.\n\nThe party\u2019s main criticisms centre on plans to curtail the academies\u2019 existing powers to deviate from the national curriculum and hire teachers without specified \u201cqualified teacher training\u201d, as well as ending a rule that requires failing schools to be taken over by an academy.\n\nNeil O\u2019Brien, shadow education secretary, also said he is concerned about a provision in the bill that would allow local authorities to intervene in an academy\u2019s admissions decisions.\n\n\u201cThey are giving local authorities powers to share out pupils from good schools to prop up failing schools,\u201d he said. \u201cI am very worried about what left-wing local authorities will do with this power.\u201d\n\nLabour grandee Lord David Blunkett, who introduced the first academy schools as education secretary under New Labour, disagreed with this characterisation, arguing the bill did not represent an effort to \u201cunravel what\u2019s been done or go back to some bygone era\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in favour of having a national curriculum that applies to all schools,\u201d he told the Financial Times. \u201cWe never envisaged that academy schools would wander off on their own as if they were private schools.\u201d\n\nPossibly. Unions are adamant that academies can be locally divisive and that reforms to the school system must aim to create a system that provides opportunity to all children \u2014 a position that academy trust heads agree with.\n\nPatrick Roach, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, also said the bill was not removing academy freedoms but \u201censuring there are national frameworks, where academies like all other state-funded schools are delivering the best opportunities for all learners\u201d.\n\nCruddas from the Confederation of School Trusts said that the solution, in her view, is not to remove academy freedoms over pay and conditions, but to extend them to all schools \u2014 whether academised or local authority controlled.\n\nEducation secretary Bridget Phillipson said that was already in effect the plan when she appeared in front of the Education Select Committee this week, saying that the changes were intended to set a minimum \u201cfloor\u201d for all schools, not a \u201cceiling\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cThat innovation, that flexibility, that excellence \u2014 much of which we have seen within the academy system \u2014 I want to be available to all schools.\u201d\n\nThe Confederation of School Trusts said it welcomed the \u201cdirection of travel\u201d apparently set by Phillipson, but warned that the legislation would need to be amended to say that schools only have to have \u201cregard\u201d for national pay scales, rather than being \u201cconstrained by them\u201d.\n\nA person close to Phillipson disagreed that amendments were necessary, saying that the government can simply mandate that pay scales are a minimum, rather than a maximum.\n\nData visualisations by Amy Borrett", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/76e15eeb-c057-4c5b-b441-088626d1ab8c"}}, {"id": "9b7b65f6-39d3-4f43-9bb7-4f5ca1f6c39d", "event_name": "UK considers higher cap on foreign state ownership of British media", "blurb": "Labour may allow stakes of up to 10% to encourage passive investment from sovereign wealth and pension funds ", "date": "2025-01-1800:00:00.0", "body": "The UK is considering doubling the proposed threshold of foreign state ownership of the country\u2019s news outlets in response to fears that setting the level too low would unnecessarily stifle dealmaking in the media industry.\n\nThe Labour government might allow stakes as large as 10 per cent, significantly higher than the 5 per cent level that the previous Conservative administration was consulting on, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn March last year, the Tories changed the law to ban foreign states from owning stakes in UK news organisations for the first time, a move designed to block the takeover of the Telegraph newspaper by a US investor backed by the United Arab Emirates.\n\nMinisters intended to introduce an exemption to the ban for small stakes under a certain threshold to allow passive investment, particularly in listed media companies, from sovereign wealth and state pension funds.

When the Telegraph was first put up for sale in 2023, for example, the Daily Mail\u2019s owners held talks with investors from Qatar about potentially teaming up on a bid.\n\nMedia executives are also concerned the law will hit state pension funds, such as the vast Norwegian, Canadian and Australian funds that are shareholders in listed media companies.\n\nLabour\u2019s decision on where to set the ownership threshold may be controversial given the fierce debate last year among MPs about the risks of allowing foreign states the ability to exert influence on UK media.\n\nParliamentarians from both main parties were critical of RedBird IMI\u2019s bid, as were executives at the Telegraph itself. Among anxious Tory MPs, a key concern was the potential for overseas control of a right-wing broadsheet seen as influential in their party leadership contests.\n\nThe sale of the Telegraph, which led to intense scrutiny over press freedoms in Abu Dhabi itself, soured relations between the UK and the UAE, which is a major investor in Britain.\n\nEmirati officials expressed frustration about pejorative comments made about their state by a string of British politicians in relation to the proposed Telegraph deal.

Here they share their favourite activities, meals and customs to usher in prosperity and good fortune.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much like Christmas,\u201d says Robert Wun of the Lunar New Year holiday. \u201cExcept it\u2019s longer than one day, and it\u2019s less about religion and more about tradition.\u201d Each of the 15 days during the holiday period have different requirements, he explains, whether it is eating vegetarian dishes (believed to help purify and cleanse the body) or visiting temples to pay respects to certain gods. The latter is harder to do in London, where Wun, who was born and raised in Hong Kong, has resided for the last 17 years. It\u2019s here that he runs his eponymous couture label.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare for me to go back home because Lunar New Year often overlaps with fashion week and we are busy making a new collection,\u201d says Wun. \u201cI\u2019ve ended up having a little community here in London with people from the same culture, so we usually have dinner together.\u201d That could involve hot pot (savoury broth with a platter of meats and vegetables to be communally cooked) at home, or dim sum at Royal China on Baker Street, where he usually orders steamed rice noodle rolls and a Cantonese-style steamed sponge cake (the latter is a favourite of Wun\u2019s grandma). \u201cWe share everything \u2014 that\u2019s the whole point,\u201d he says.\n\nOn what to wear, Wun recommends: \u201cNothing that seems shabby.\u201d That includes distressed clothing, even if the style is intentional. He also advises not to carry books around in a bag \u2014 something he was often told off for, as a child, when he loved reading comic books. \u201cThe word, book, in Chinese sounds similar to the word, losing,\u201d he explains. Opt for colours like red or purple, because they indicate celebration and success, Wun says. They don\u2019t have to be visible, either. \u201cMany friends wear red underwear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a rooster and 100 per cent believe it,\u201d says Patricia Zhou of her Chinese zodiac animal and the traits associated with it. \u201cI\u2019ve read that roosters are meant to be good at focusing on one thing and I do excel at menial tasks. I\u2019m a ballet dancer and I\u2019m always doing the same thing, over and over and over again.\u201d\n\nZhou, whose mother is from Beijing and father from Changsha, grew up near Windsor in Ontario, Canada. Today, she lives in London. Her childhood recollections of Lunar New Year are hazy, but she says that \u201cas I\u2019ve gotten older, I have more memories of celebrating, because it\u2019s a way to connect to my heritage and learn more about my culture.\u201d\n\nThis year, she plans to follow tradition and wear red. \u201cWhen I was in Shanghai this summer I went to Suzhou and there were a lot of traditional dresses. I tried one on and absolutely loved it. I have it now and think I may wear it for Lunar New Year. It is like a long kilt with corsetry that wraps around the waist and there are beautiful ornaments on the front and back.\u201d\n\nZhou\u2019s favourite thing to eat during the holiday is tang yuan (chewy glutinous rice balls) filled with a sweet sesame paste and served with hot soup. Shrimp, she says, is also on the menu: \u201cThe word in Chinese sounds like \u2018ha\u2019, which I guess is supposed to sound like laughter, and during the holidays you\u2019re meant to have a lot of that.\u201d But there\u2019s no need to stick too closely to tradition, she notes. \u201cChinese rice wine is intense. Lately I\u2019ve really gotten into sake, so I plan to have a few friends over and have a sake-tasting with some Chinese food.\u201d\n\nFood is what makes Lunar New Year special for Beijing-born Mimi Xu, who moved to Paris at the age of three with her French-Chinese father and Hong Kong mother. \u201cChinese tradition is all about eating, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s huge in France too. Unlike America, where people sometimes have lunch on the go, here we have a proper two- or three-course meal \u2014 and with wine!\u201d says Xu, who currently lives in London. \u201cFood is a big part of my life and Lunar New Year is a good opportunity to eat more and host friends.\u201d\n\nXu typically spends the holiday in Paris with her mother. Sometimes, she\u2019ll burn some incense at home and say a prayer. \u201cLunar New Year is quite spiritual and is a time to reflect.\u201d But this year will be different. As the composer of the musical score for Luz, one of the movies nominated in the World Cinema Dramatic Competition category at the Sundance Film Festival, she will be in Salt Lake City, Utah. \u201cThe director and producer is from Hong Kong, and there are a lot of Hong Kong or Taiwanese actors [in the film],\u201d she says, so even while abroad, \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll celebrate big time.\u201d\n\nOn her return, Xu would like to prepare a Chinese meal at home for friends. Among her key dishes for the holiday are roast duck, steamed turbot with ginger and spring onion, and Chinese broccoli with garlic. \u201cDuring lockdown I perfected Hainanese chicken rice \u2014 the chicken and rice are both cooked with chicken fat, and I do a ginger sauce on the side,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the most traditional but it feels festive,\u201d in part because \u201cmaking it is a long process.\u201d\n\nBorn in Montreal to a Scottish father and Chinese mother, Blake Abbie remembers having to navigate cultural differences as a child. \u201cOne of my earliest memories of Lunar New Year is being sent to my relatives and told to bow and ask for hong bao,\u201d he says, referring to red envelopes containing money, typically given as a gift by married couples during holidays and special occasions. \u201cBeing mixed race, there were moments when I felt awkward and maybe not so confident doing it, especially with my dad\u2019s family \u2014 even though they were incredibly open and respectful.\u201d He adds: \u201cTo have two parents who are very engaged in each other\u2019s cultures is a massive privilege.\u201d\n\nAbbie, who now lives in New York, follows the Chinese tradition of not cleaning his hair, clothes or home on the first day of the new Lunar year as those actions could remove one\u2019s good fortune. That means \u201cno taking out the garbage\u201d either, he says. Wearing white should be avoided, he advises, as it\u2019s a colour sometimes worn to Chinese funerals. White flowers or yellow chrysanthemums are not recommended either as they are associated with death and mourning.\n\nFor the food, Abbie recalls: \u201cWhen I was a kid, we\u2019d have at least eight different dishes. My grandma would make fatty braised pork belly in a clay pot with salted mustard greens\u201d \u2014 a speciality dish from Hangzhou where his mother is from. \u201cI don\u2019t eat meat any more but that flavour remains a core memory in my mind.\u201d He also remembers his family serving a whole fish, with the head and tail served intact to represent a positive beginning and end to the year. Ultimately, he says, \u201cit\u2019s about gathering and spending time together. The best part of Lunar New Year now is that so many of my friends [around the world] want to celebrate it.\u201d\n\nFollow us on Instagram and sign up for Fashion Matters, your weekly newsletter about the fashion industry", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/82b5547b-63ac-4480-b68f-0f4705802b1d"}}, {"id": "0c54e402-cb6c-4c0c-a315-e37092af2f2a", "event_name": "Young people are hanging out less \u2014 it may be harming their mental health", "blurb": "Could the decline of face-to-face interaction tie together several modern mysteries?", "date": "2025-01-1800:00:00.0", "body": "What do the loneliness epidemic, falling rates of adolescent drinking and dating, and worsening mental health among teenagers and young adults have in common?\n\nFor starters, two of them are disputed to some degree. The paucity of solid historical data on loneliness has led some to question whether there has been any rise at all, let alone an epidemic. And on young adult mental health, some argue that a significant portion of the observed increase in problems is simply picking up cases that would previously have gone undiagnosed, while others point to misleading statistics.\n\nSceptics are not wrong to raise doubts, and there has almost certainly been a degree of overstatement. But as time passes and both data and testimony mount, there is growing acknowledgment that the absence of concrete causal evidence does not constitute evidence of absence. Indeed there is an increasing sense that these phenomena may not only be real, but all part of the same wider shift: plummeting in-person socialising among young people.\n\nUntil recently, the evidence on loneliness was weak at best, but surveys that previously showed it declining among US high school seniors now show steep climbs. In the UK and Europe, new data published in 2024 shows a marked rise in loneliness among people in their twenties. This mirrors patterns in socialising, or rather the lack thereof.\u00a0As the Atlantic\u2019s Derek Thompson wrote last week, we are increasingly living in the antisocial century. Far from being a US-specific trend, this is sweeping the western world. The share of young people on either side of the Atlantic who regularly meet up socially with friends, family or colleagues has dropped sharply. In Europe, the share who don\u2019t even socialise once a week has risen from one in ten to one in four.\n\nPeople in their teens and twenties now hang out about as much as someone 10 years older than them did in the past. Not so much a case of 30 being the new 20, as 20 being the new 30. Less hanging out and less partying means less sex and less drinking. Both are developments that have been welcomed by the public health community, but they mask a darker side.\n\nTrends in time spent alone are an almost exact parallel of trends in mental health, where rates of mental distress are mounting among the young, but not the middle-aged or older. A wealth of public health research suggests the two are not merely coincidental but causally linked. Time spent alone is strongly associated with lower life satisfaction and even elevated mortality.\n\nSome of the most valuable evidence comes in the form of detailed time-use records from the US and UK, which show a marked increase in time spent alone among teens and young adults over the past decade, but little to no change among older groups. Most importantly, this diary data also captures how people are feeling over the course of their day as they do different things with (or without) different people.\n\nA clear and consistent finding is that more time spent alone is associated with lower life satisfaction, and people report lower levels of happiness when performing the same activity alone compared to with a companion. Using the levels of happiness and meaningfulness that Americans ascribe to various activities in these records, I find that the deterioration in young people\u2019s life satisfaction between 2010 and 2023 can be explained to a substantial degree by changes in how they spend their time.\n\nThe most obvious culprit in terms of timing and age gradient is the proliferation of smartphones and hyper-engaging social media, which has kicked into overdrive with the era of short-form video. Of all the dozens of activities rated in the American time-use data, solitary hours spent gaming, scrolling social media and watching videos are rated as the least meaningful.\n\nThe fact that these ratings are given by the very teens and young adults spending hours glued to their devices underscores the tragedy at the heart of this story: the people suffering are on some level aware of what\u2019s going wrong, but seem powerless to prevent it.\n\nThe last decade is a story of young people retreating from the pursuits that bring them the most fulfilment, and replacing them \u2014 consciously or otherwise \u2014 with pale imitations. Like the proverbial frog in the pot of water, the damage in any given moment is too subtle to cut through, but several years in we may be starting to reach a roiling simmer.\n\njohn.burn-murdoch@ft.com, @jburnmurdoch\n\nLetter in response to this column:\n\nScotland\u2019s famous philosopher saw the error of his ways / From Michael Nevin, Author, Edinburgh, UK", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/23053544-fede-4c0d-8cda-174e9bdce348"}}, {"id": "f30b1115-9c8d-4073-9542-e06f172d0189", "event_name": "Britain needs to rediscover its economic spirit of adventure", "blurb": "History teaches us that lasting growth depends on new ideas, innovation and technological progress", "date": "2025-01-1800:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is the author of \u2018Growth: A Reckoning\u2019 and an economist at Oxford university and King\u2019s College London\n\nThe British economy is in trouble. Growth is non-existent. Productivity, which already sits below the US, Germany, and France, is falling. Real wages have barely moved for 16 years, their worst run since the Napoleonic Wars. And investors are starting to wobble, pushing borrowing costs up to a 16-year high.\n\nHow did Britain get in this mess \u2014 and how does it get out? It is hard to think of a more important question for the country. Yet the new Labour government has still not provided a persuasive answer. Instead, their focus has been on a handful of economic messages that have created unhelpful traps for themselves and actively harmed growth.\n\nIn opposition, the message was \u201cno taxes on working people\u201d. Perhaps this was politically useful, a defence against warnings that they would raid voters\u2019 pay packets. But its presentation was botched, bogging Labour down in weeks of esoteric argument about the true meaning of the word \u201cworking\u201d. Worse still, keeping the promise in power has held the economy back.\n\nThis is not a good moment to put the bulk of a mammoth \u00a340bn tax rise \u2014 the largest since 1993 \u2014 on to business. Small companies are in decline. The number of new start-ups has been falling for five years. Worklessness is stubbornly high. And the aftermath of the eventual national insurance hike \u2014 surveys suggesting higher prices and lower wages to come \u2014 looks, in effect, like a tax on workers.\n\nIn office, another message took hold: Britain faced a \u201cblack hole\u201d in its public finances. This could have been cast as fiscal irresponsibility, requiring new borrowing rules and transparency measures. But instead, Labour presented it as fiscal overspend, repeatedly stressing the vastness of the shortfall (\u201c\u00a322bn\u201d), contorting themselves in unconvincing argumentative gymnastics to avoid the obvious solution to their own framing \u2014 more austerity.\n\nAnd again, none of this helped growth. Week after week, we were told about the catastrophic state of Britain, how \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d and \u201ctough choices\u201d lay ahead. All that unrelenting pessimism crushed the country\u2019s stirring animal spirits.\n\n\u201cThe government,\u201d noted the former chief economist at the Bank of England and FT contributing editor, Andy Haldane, \u201chas generated fear and foreboding, uncertainty\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009which is unfortunate because just after the election there was a sense of refresh, a sense of renewal.\u201d\n\nThe closest the government has come to a diagnosis of what has gone so wrong is their most recent message: we must \u201cfix the foundations\u201d.\u00a0It is true that Britain does fail to do the basics. We have a backlog of several million houses that need to be built. The application process for the Lower Thames crossing \u2014 a tunnel under the river \u2014 cost more than twice what it actually cost to build the longest road tunnel in the world in Norway. We haven\u2019t built a nuclear power plant for three decades and our next \u2014 Hinkley Point C \u2014 is six times more costly than those in South Korea.\n\nIn the pursuit of prosperity, however, it is not enough to simply fix the foundations. Britain must build the future as well.\n\nThe little we know about growth is that it comes not just from old-fashioned investments in roads and houses, but from new ideas, innovation and technological progress. This points towards a deeper diagnosis of what has gone so wrong in Britain: it is not simply that those old-fashioned investments are stagnant, but these other growth-promoting parts of economic life are languishing as well.\n\nBusinesses are struggling to innovate, filing far fewer patents than rivals in Europe and elsewhere, with private R&D now falling as a percentage of GDP. British universities are not helping, doing a wonderful job of producing academic research (57 per cent more publications per capita than the US) but being consistently poor at putting those ideas to productive use.\n\nThe City of London, a traditional source of British vitality, looks exhausted. While the total value of companies on the London Stock Exchange fell since 2007, the value of American stocks trebled. What\u2019s more, the industries choosing Britain are dated. The five largest companies in the UK by market capitalisation are mostly from old-school sectors: oil, mining, finance, chemicals. In the US, it is Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet that dominate.\n\nAnd we know that the technology sector really matters for growth. In the US, it is almost entirely responsible for the country\u2019s astounding productivity performance \u2014 three times the pace in the Eurozone and the UK since 2008-09. That is why this week\u2019s AI \u201caction plan\u201d for the UK is encouraging: AI will be the most important technology of the 21st century and the UK has the most valuable AI sector in Europe. It must now build on it, deploying the political leadership and financial resources required to turn the 50 recommendations in that plan into reality.\n\nThree hundred years ago, Britain thundered ahead of its rivals because a fresh spirit took hold \u2014 risk-taking, entrepreneurial, aggressive in discovering new ideas about the world, single-minded in putting them to practical use. It is that spirit we need to nurture once again.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nSpirit of adventurism / From Dr Paul Armstrong, Lifford, County Donegal, Ireland\n\nRemember, if you don\u2019t grow it, you have to mine it / From Julian Bennett, Sible Hedingham, Essex, UK", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/06363b83-3f17-48aa-b111-19851ed227b8"}}, {"id": "a3e568c5-3166-4f5e-8547-73eceb8ebd6c", "event_name": "Dale Vince did not donate \u00a35mn to Labour to spite ex-wife, judge rules", "blurb": "Former spouse of green entrepreneur awarded more than \u00a340mn in high-profile divorce settlement", "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0", "body": "A judge has ruled that green tycoon Dale Vince did not give more than \u00a35mn to the UK Labour party to spite his former wife but at the same time has awarded her over \u00a340mn in a high-profile settlement.\n\nVince, founder of green energy company Ecotricity, was one of three millionaires who each gave Labour \u00a35mn ahead of its landslide general election victory in July.\n\nThe 63-year-old has been embroiled in a divorce case at the Royal Courts of Justice with his former wife Kate, who lived with him from 2000 and married him in 2006.\n\nVince claimed on Friday that his ex-wife had come away from their divorce with \u00a312mn less than the sum he had offered her four years ago, after taking into account legal fees.\n\nLawyers for Ms Vince, 50, had complained to the court that her former husband had been giving away matrimonial assets \u2014 including over \u00a35mn of donations to Labour \u2014 to which she should have been partly entitled, and keeping her \u201cin the dark\u201d about this.\n\nIn March the High Court ordered Vince to inform his wife before handing over any more cash to the Labour party or to a group called the Green Britain Foundation.

Big gilt investors have warned that the government might be forced to raise taxes, or cut spending, to maintain credibility with the market.\n\nIn an update to its World Economic Outlook, the IMF said on Friday the UK economy would grow 1.6 per cent in 2025 \u2014 a 0.1 percentage point increase on the previous forecast and up from 0.9 per cent last year.

And almost as expensive due to years of cash flowing in to escape the inflation in neighbouring countries such as Argentina. What\u2019s nicer than an ocean-view apartment to preserve your wealth in real terms?\n\nPhysical assets have always had this appeal. But modern economies are not the same as they were half a century ago when inflation last reigned supreme. Nowadays, things you can touch are less relevant. Land, buildings, resources and financial securities still make up the bulk of national balance sheets. In the west, however, the value of brands, patents, software, data, research and development and so on, has outpaced tangible asset growth for decades.\n\nUK intangible investment now exceeds \u00a3200bn annually \u2014 a fifth more than tangible investment. Unlike the latter, though, intangibles and high inflation have never coexisted at scale for long. One day they might. Although December consumer prices in America and the UK were cooler than expected on Wednesday, the relief rally in equities and bonds shows just how nervous markets are.\n\nShould prices rise further from here, equity holders have much to worry about. That is because corporations have driven the global explosion in intangible assets. For example in 1975, when headline inflation in the US was in double digits, almost 85 per cent of company assets was tangible stuff such as plant and machinery, transportation equipment and inventory. In the intervening half century the split has reversed. Intangible assets now account for 90 per cent of S&P 500 balance sheets. This occurred as inflation fell to almost a side show. Therefore, most equity owners have never pondered what happens to their intangible-heavy stocks if consumer prices surge.\n\nIn theory, high inflation should have no effect on the value of tangible or intangible assets. But things are much harder in practice. For starters, intangible assets are slippery to value. There are no traded prices. The \u201cexpected future economic benefit\u201d of a trademark, say, is anyone\u2019s guess at the best of times. Companies already spend fortunes paying accountants to arrive at intangible asset values they are happy with. Add high and volatile inflation and imagine how accurate such estimates become.\n\nWith global mergers and acquisition volumes approaching $4tn last year, this is cause for concern. Even with low inflation, the prevalence of intangibles raises the likelihood that companies overpay for each other. This normally happens in two ways. Either future profits or historical asset values are overstated. Most likely both. So it is unhelpful when analysing companies that accountants cannot resolve a long-running dispute.\u00a0Namely, whether something such as an R&D department is an asset that needs to be on a balance sheet and depreciated like a machine, or an expense on a profit and loss account. Both can be fudged but some consistency would be welcome.\n\nWorse, the value of \u201cinternally generated\u201d intangible assets such as customer databases or trade names are not recognised, full stop. Until, that is, someone comes along and buys the company at which point they pop into view as \u201cgoodwill\u201d on the balance sheet. The more deals, the more goodwill builds up. Until it doesn\u2019t. This time last year Walgreens, a US pharmacy, wrote down $12.4bn of goodwill related to a historical acquisition.\n\nPerhaps the biggest risk from high inflation is that such \u201cbadwill\u201d can stay hidden. Why? Because it sits on a balance sheet at a constant value (provided it isn\u2019t written down) no matter what happens to inflation. So as revenues and profits zoom upwards in line with higher prices, the intangible assets that help to generate them remain fixed at \u201ccost\u201d. This boosts returns.\n\nThus even the worst dealmaking chief executive is a genius if inflation is high enough. Goodwill that would have been written down in periods of low inflation can now sit there for years. Until some idiot buys the company.\n\nWhat of the question of whether intangible assets are good inflation hedges? Certainly an income-generating patent can hold its value, as should a highly trained workforce. But be honest. If your country became Venezuela tomorrow, would you rather own a factory and its land or an R&D department? A state of the art robot or a copyright?\n\nAnd you might also suppose something as ethereal as a brand is the last thing you\u2019d want. Wrong, say marketing types. Brand loyalty is even more valuable when price hikes fray customer nerves. But academic research on inflation in emerging markets is unequivocal. People switch to cheaper alternatives. Or buy a condo in Punta.\n\nstuart.kirk@ft.com", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/921e0fb1-9f4b-46eb-81ce-93d03e0d6641"}}, {"id": "233a58a5-d30a-451b-8454-dce2c753a805", "event_name": "Wanted: a clear governing philosophy for Labour", "blurb": "School and workers\u2019 rights reforms jar with the government\u2019s stated growth mission", "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0", "body": "The UK government\u2019s plea to regulators to come up with ideas for growth is easily lampooned. It\u2019s not entirely foolish to put regulators on notice that their remits may change \u2014 but only as long as you also consult those who know what it\u2019s like to be regulated. Here, as so often with this government, the signals are confusing.\n\nGoverning is hard. There is some schadenfreude, among veterans of previous administrations, at Labour\u2019s dawning recognition of this after six months in office. When Sir Keir Starmer railed against what he called the \u201ctepid bath of managed decline\u201d, he was expressing frustration felt by every new prime minister. But in his case, things are made worse by the lack of a clear governing philosophy.\n\nThe new administration is full of energised ministers, working hard. But there is little read-across.\u00a0The cabinet feels more like a group of individuals with wildly divergent views of the world than a team with anything approaching a coherent analysis of what ails Britain, and what to do about it.\n\nListening to the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster vowing to \u201cmake the state more like a start up\u201d, the science and technology minister waxing lyrical about artificial intelligence, or the health secretary talking about patient choice, it\u2019s possible to feel optimistic. An entirely different impression is generated by the education secretary, who is seeking to turn the clock back by ripping up two decades of cross-party policy that improved schools. And by the deputy prime minister, whose gargantuan workers\u2019 rights package is further undermining business confidence, even as the Treasury tries to restore it.\n\nAll governing parties are a coalition of interests. But the extent of the dissonance in this case makes it hard to be sure where this government will land on any given issue. Which in turn makes it hard to build trust.\n\nThe argument for Angela Rayner\u2019s employment rights bill is that the UK\u2019s low productivity is partly explained by insecure work. In that light, some of the measures seem reasonable: abolishing \u201cfire and rehire\u201d practices that impose new terms and conditions on workers, helping the self-employed get paid on time, and softening some aspects of zero-hours contracts. But the bill contains a whole slew of other rules: on rights to sick pay from day one, on parental leave and unfair dismissal, on stronger union powers and others that directly contradict the growth mission that Starmer claims is central.\n\nInsecure work may indeed be bad for productivity. But so is no work at all. The independent Regulatory Policy Committee has slammed the government\u2019s impact assessment of the bill as \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, and warned that the measures will hurt low-wage workers. Business surveys suggest the bill will accelerate moves to invest in technology not people. The complexity and scale of the new rights mean \u2014 of course \u2014 that a whole new regulator will be created to oversee them.\n\nNumber 10 and the Treasury are scarred by the business reaction to the rise in national insurance, and deeply anxious about recent economic news. You would think they would be radically rowing back on the employment proposals. Instead, a weak compromise of a nine-month probationary period has been offered on the issue of unfair dismissal.\n\nGiven the concerns over what the package may to do workers\u2019 prospects, only two groups stand unequivocally to benefit: lawyers and trade unions. Something similar applies to the schools bill from the education department, where secretary of state Bridget Phillipson seems to be freelancing with no link to anything the rest of government is doing.\n\nPhillipson wants to dismantle the reforms that were started by Labour\u2019s Andrew Adonis, who grew up in care, and later turbocharged by the Conservative Michael Gove, the adopted son of a Scottish fish processor. The reforms pushed England\u2019s schools up the international rankings to be some of the best in the world. They were based on the twin principles of creating academy schools with more freedoms, for example to pay good teachers more, and requiring greater accountability through league tables. Academies became the tool for turning round failing schools.\n\nPhillipson wants to sweep much of this away, with no convincing alternative philosophy of how to drive up standards.\u00a0Her answer to what should be done about schools ranked as \u201cinadequate\u201d seems to be to replace that word with something broader, which won\u2019t give parents the same clarity\n\nNone of this makes any sense. There are improvements that could have been made, for example to the scrutiny of multi-academy trusts. But why change a system that has helped large numbers of the poorest children?\n\nWhen it comes to investment, Labour\u2019s majority has brought some much-needed political stability. But investors also need confidence in the consistent direction of policy. They need an educated and flexible labour market, too. To ignore that seems unwise, to say the least.\n\nUnlike Boris Johnson, Starmer is neither lazy nor chaotic. But like Johnson, he is finding out that ideas, some of them very bad indeed, fill any hint of a vacuum at the centre. In meetings, he is known for asking for solutions, not problems. But in Whitehall, the most intractable questions move upwards through the system until they land on the prime minister\u2019s desk. Without a clearer indication of what he wants, it will be hard to drive the machine.\n\ncamilla.cavendish@ft.com", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2dfe88a2-ce32-487a-be6c-2e8d946c5c9f"}}, {"id": "c76af23a-808c-490b-a290-f1e400a577bf", "event_name": "Manchester United draws up plans for Old Trafford replacement ", "blurb": "Project to upgrade stadium or build new 100,000-seater promises to boost economic growth across region ", "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0", "body": "Manchester United\u2019s plans to rebuild or redevelop Old Trafford are set to drive one of the UK\u2019s \u201cbiggest ever urban regeneration projects\u201d, according to new proposals.\n\nThe Premier League club will decide by the end of this season whether to build a new 100,000-capacity ground, creating the country\u2019s biggest stadium, or upgrade and expand the existing one.\n\nEither option will spearhead 100 acres of sports-led regeneration immediately next door to Manchester city centre, according to plans drawn up by a task force including Lord Sebastian Coe, who led the London 2012 Olympics, local authorities and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham.\n\nIts initial proposals, published on Friday, promise new housing, entertainment venues and transport links.\n\nSpeculation about the future of Old Trafford, the condition of which is a major bugbear for fans, has been rife since the chemicals billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe bought a significant stake in the club last year.\n\nRatcliffe has previously pledged a \u201cWembley of the North\u201d in its place.

The taskforce\u2019s proposals would require involvement from central government to co-ordinate heavy rail services, as well as investment in new local transport links.

They restrict how much banks can lend as a multiple of a person\u2019s income or the value of a property and require affordability tests to check if borrowers could cope with future interest rate rises.\n\nThe idea of easing mortgage rules was welcomed by Charles Roe, director of mortgages at trade body UK Finance. \u201cReviewing the mortgage lending rules would help with affordability issues, not just for first-time buyers but also those looking to move further up the housing ladder,\u201d he said.\n\nRichard Donnell, executive director at property portal Zoopla, said the \u201cbig hurdle\u201d preventing more people from getting a mortgage was the stress test of affordability, which requires banks to test if borrowers can cope with a rise in borrowing costs.\n\n\u201cThis has come at the cost of pricing more people out of the market,\u201d said Donnell, adding that before the recent rise in interest rates, lenders typically stress-tested if borrowers could afford a rate of about 6 per cent and that had risen as high as 8-9 per cent.\n\nBut Sir Vince Cable, former Liberal Democrat business secretary in the 2010-2015 coalition government, said relaxing mortgage requirements could be highly risky.\n\n\u201cIt seems ominously similar to trends two decades ago which culminated in the mad 125 per cent Northern Rock mortgages\u00a0and self-certification, which did not end well,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if there is no systemic risk, this would add demand without supply \u2014 we know where that leads.\u201d", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/cb3d57a4-398d-4aec-a7ca-ed9a52ebce1a"}}, {"id": "4472bc62-fe1f-401f-a03b-dfc788e3a33e", "event_name": "No one objected to Mayfair cash deliveries, James Stunt tells money laundering trial ", "blurb": "Socialite has insisted he had no knowledge of alleged criminal enterprise ", "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0", "body": "Socialite James Stunt has told his money laundering trial that he would have stopped large cash deliveries from taking place at his offices in London\u2019s Mayfair \u201cif anyone had raised an objection\u201d.\n\nProsecutors cross-examined the former son-in-law of Formula 1 magnate Bernie Ecclestone on Friday after they accused him of being part of a scheme allowing criminals to funnel more than \u00a3200mn of \u201cdirty money\u201d into the banking system.\n\nJurors heard that Stunt had started a joint venture with Fowler Oldfield, a Bradford-based precious metals and jewellery dealer that prosecutors claim was a financial \u201cgateway\u201d for criminals between 2014 and 2016.\n\nTestifying at Leeds Crown Court, Stunt acknowledged he allowed client cash from Fowler Oldfield to be delivered to his offices, but insisted he had no knowledge of criminality.\n\nJonathan Sandiford KC, for the prosecution, asked Stunt whether the sight of \u201cmen in helmets\u201d from security company G4S delivering \u201clarge sums of cash\u201d to his \u201cplush Mayfair office\u201d fitted with the image his company was seeking to project.\n\nStunt said: \u201cIf anyone had raised an objection that this was something untoward I would have shut [it] down immediately\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009There was no objection to this whatsoever.\u201d\n\nAsked by what means he had envisaged the cash was to be delivered, Stunt said: \u201cObviously, not a bin liner\u201d.

He added that a flurry of new investors \u201ccould be partly due to non-Muslim members of the scheme being attracted to the fund\u2019s past performance\u201d.\n\nIslam\u2019s sharia law forbids the charging of interest and earning income from gambling, tobacco and alcohol, among other \u201charam\u201d business activities. Portfolios must be certified by specialist boards of Islamic scholars, who screen investments within sharia indices on the basis of their business activities and their debt, cash and interest-based income levels to determine whether they are compliant.\n\n\u201cThis creates slight biases \u2014 for example, private equity is very difficult [to invest in] because of the leverage, [but] tech companies tend to pass the screens,\u201d said Chris Redmond, head of manager research at pensions consultancy Willis Towers Watson.\n\nSharia indices are reviewed periodically and securities that exceed a threshold for haram activities are removed.\n\nA portion of the dividends from the remaining investments \u2014 in line with the amount of money they make from prohibited activities \u2014 is often donated to charity, explained Maya Marissa Malek, chief executive of Amanie Advisors, which provides guidance on Islamic investments.\n\nRedmond said that a regulatory push to serve all pension savers, together with a growth in the size of defined contribution pension schemes, had spurred providers to improve their provision in recent years.\n\n\u201cDC pension schemes are the biggest game in town, and as those schemes grow larger, they have more bandwidth to take the time to find a sharia-compliant scheme,\u201d said Redmond.\n\nThe UK has been at the forefront of sharia fund investment in part because of its large British Muslim population.\n\nIn 2022, Uber\u2019s UK pensions provider launched a new sharia fund following the threat of legal action from a trade union. NOW Pensions, one of the UK\u2019s largest pension plans, created its sharia fund after the App Drivers & Couriers Union said it would take Uber to court over the issue. The union said the lack of a sharia option had made the pension scheme \u201ceffectively\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. inaccessible\u201d for Uber\u2019s Muslim-majority workforce.\n\nHSBC Asset Management, among the largest providers of Islamic funds globally, said that UK DC pension schemes held $5.3bn of its flagship Islamic Global Equity Index Fund\u2019s $7.3bn in assets under management, as of September 30 2024.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a notable pick-up in interest over the past five to six years, in line with the broader interest in ethical investing,\u201d said Sefian Kasem, head of investment specialists, ETF strategy, at HSBC Asset Management.\n\nThe \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of new flows into Islamic global equities \u201cwent into broad passive equity funds, reflecting trends we see in the broader market,\u201d added Kenneth Lamont, strategist at Morningstar.\n\nPension experts say that sharia funds\u2019 high exposure to groups of similar stocks presents a risk. Nest, the UK\u2019s state-backed pension scheme with its own \u00a3620mn sharia fund, said it feared the vehicles were \u201ctoo concentrated\u201d in \u201cUS-based technology stocks\u201d and would eventually require \u201ccushioning as stock markets can be volatile and incur losses during downturns\u201d.\n\nNest\u2019s sharia fund has delivered annualised returns of 15 per cent over the past decade, compared with 7 per cent for the pension scheme\u2019s \u201cstarter\u201d fund and 9 per cent for its \u201chigher risk\u201d fund.

Although the cap was removed in 2023, British-based banks have taken time to review and fully implement their pay policies, presenting a mixed landscape.\n\nWhile European banks in London must still cap bonuses at twice base salary, Barclays and JPMorgan have decided to award so-called material risk takers up to 10 times their fixed pay, while Goldman Sachs has opted to cut base pay, but increase the bonus ratio to 25 times.\n\nThe legal profession is expected to be the other big winner this bonus season, as the arrival of big US law firms in the capital disrupts the market, fuelling pay wars for talent.\n\nReaders will be able to tell us anonymously how any changes will affect their personal pay prospects, as well as altering competition dynamics in the wider recruitment market.\n\nThe survey also gives readers the chance to say how Labour\u2019s first Budget has affected their financial planning, from the expense of paying VAT on school fees to how proposed inheritance tax changes make pension saving less attractive.\n\nLast year\u2019s FT bonus survey revealed that many well-paid professionals were squeezed by a combination of smaller payouts and higher interest rates.\n\nCompleted by nearly 3,000 FT readers, 58 per cent said their bonus had fallen or flatlined compared with the previous year, and there was a sharp jump [64 per cent] in the numbers of people who said they intended to use their bonus to reduce mortgage debts.

Starmer too said he would be \u201cruthless with cuts\u201d if needed to keep to Labour\u2019s fiscal rules after the rise in UK borrowing costs in recent months.\n\nStarmer sets great store on what he believes is a strong early relationship with Trump, despite the president-elect\u2019s close ties with his domestic rival Nigel Farage, and the Trump campaign in October accusing his Labour party of interfering in the US election.\n\nStarmer has repeatedly harked back to the president-elect hosting him for dinner at Trump Tower in New York last September.\n\n\u201cHe made a huge effort,\u201d Starmer said, sitting in a puffa jacket in Kyiv\u2019s traditional Kanapa restaurant, a log fire burning in the corner. \u201cHe came to New York to have dinner with me and I was very grateful for that.\u201d\n\nThe relationship is now about to be tested, especially if Trump follows through on his threat to impose new global tariffs.\n\n\u201cTariffs aren\u2019t in anybody\u2019s interests,\u201d said Starmer, as plates of dumplings and mushrooms begin to arrive. \u201cOur ambition is to have a deal of some sorts with the US, a trade deal. That\u2019s where our focus is.\u201d\n\nSome kind of UK-US trade deal has been the dream of successive British prime ministers since Brexit, but has never materialised. Starmer rejected the \u201cfalse choice\u201d that he would have to choose between a deal with Trump or a better trade deal with the EU.\n\nThe timing of Starmer\u2019s visit to Kyiv on Thursday \u2014 days before Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 was a symbolic show of the UK\u2019s continued support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy: the two men signed a \u201c100-year partnership\u201d between the two countries.\n\nBut it was also an opportunity for Starmer to indicate to Trump that Britain was prepared to join France and other European allies by stepping up to the plate \u2014 possibly by putting peacekeepers on the ground \u2014 if Ukraine agreed to end the war with Russia.\n\nTrump last month told Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron that he expected Europeans to secure the peace, but Starmer said he was confident the new US president would help put Ukraine in \u201cthe strongest possible position\u201d ahead of any peace talks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s acutely aware of the contribution the US has made here,\u201d said Starmer, whose visit to Kyiv was accompanied by Russian drone activity over the city. \u201cThat\u2019s very important to both of us. I think he absolutely understands the critical role the US will play in relation to this.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy on Thursday listed the US as one of those countries \u2014 along with Germany, Hungary and Slovakia \u2014 that oppose Ukraine\u2019s membership of Nato. Starmer said he would \u201curge\u201d those countries to keep the door open.\n\nMeanwhile, Starmer has had to put on hold a deal to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands \u2014 home to the US/UK Diego Garcia military base \u2014 from the UK to Mauritius amid fears from some in the Trump team that it could surrender influence to China.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s right that he scrutinises it,\u201d Starmer said, after the prime minister bowed to a request from Trump to study the deal before it is signed. But he insisted the deal would secure the long-term legal future of the base.\n\nWould Trump be happy to see Starmer\u2019s continued rapprochement with Beijing, including his attempts to generate more UK-China trade? \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US is our closest ally. It\u2019s usually best not to get ahead of ourselves.\u201d\n\nStarmer has enough economic problems without Trump making them worse, as Britain battles the threat of \u201cstagflation\u201d, with inflation above the Bank of England\u2019s 2 per cent target coupled with near-zero growth. Business and markets have become increasingly gloomy.\n\nBut the prime minister insisted that his long-term economic strategy was working and that his critics should stop being hung up on daily economic data, rejecting suggestions that Rachel Reeves\u2019 future as chancellor in some way depended on whether inflation last month was 2.5 per cent or 2.6 per cent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said it would take time,\u201d Starmer said, arguing that investment into Britain was strong. \u201cI don\u2019t think that overreacting to each and every single decimal point on a daily basis is necessarily reflective. We know it\u2019s going to be a long-term journey.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s 10-year gilt yield hit a post-financial crisis high of 4.93 per cent last week, but had since fallen to 4.66 per cent by the close on Friday. Gilts have rallied as weaker than expected inflation, growth and sales data prompted investors to increase their bets on interest rate cuts from the BoE.\n\nStarmer claimed that if borrowing costs exceeded expectations and blew a hole in Reeves\u2019 fiscal plans, he would not hesitate to act, even if it risked a big confrontation with Labour MPs and many of his own ministers.\n\n\u201cWe will be ruthless with cuts if that\u2019s what\u2019s necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end the fiscal rules and our commitment to them is iron-clad.\u201d Starmer insisted that last year\u2019s Budget, with its \u00a340bn tax increase, had laid the foundations for growth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about setting conditions, it\u2019s about stability, it\u2019s about certainty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about not chopping and changing \u2014 it\u2019s about sticking to the decisions that were made, tough though they were and right though they were.\u201d\n\nStarmer\u2019s approval ratings have plummeted since the general election and Labour, according to one YouGov poll, is now just one point ahead of Farage\u2019s Reform UK party. Nerves on the Labour benches are jangling.\n\n\u201cI love fights,\u201d Starmer said, as he contemplated the long train journey out of Kyiv. \u201cI had to fight to get the leadership of the Labour party, I had to fight to win the election. Five years ago people said, \u2018he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it\u2019, but I said, \u2018watch this space\u2019.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Ian Smith in London", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c1c4a27b-5594-4779-ad4e-6c63b0e76c59"}}, {"id": "547aa7ba-406a-4b75-8600-2b0b2e5003c7", "event_name": "Bank of England delays new capital rules ahead of Trump presidency", "blurb": "Officials push back implementation of new Basel regime until 2027 as they await clarity on US approach ", "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0", "body": "The Bank of England has delayed the start of new capital rules for British banks by a year while it waits to see how the incoming Trump administration will implement the global Basel agreement in the US.\n\nThe announcement by the BoE\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority on Friday that it would postpone the start of the stricter capital regime in the UK until January 2027 underlines how regulators around the world are nervously watching to see what impact Donald Trump will have on financial regulation.\n\nIt also comes as regulators in the UK are under pressure from the government to ease rules that might restrict growth.\n\nThe Basel III regime was first drawn up more than a decade ago to increase the amount of equity available to absorb stress in banks and to avoid a repeat of the state bailouts that followed the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe PRA said last year it was modifying the so-called Basel 3.1 rules to reduce the extra capital required for British banks and to delay the implementation until January 2026. It had previously pushed back the start date for the new capital regime by six months in 2023.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve has already watered down its plans for applying its so-called Basel Endgame rules on American banks after heavy lobbying by the sector. The regulations are expected to be further diluted or even abandoned under the Trump administration.\n\nIn a statement, the PRA said: \u201cGiven the current uncertainty around the timing of implementation of the Basel 3.1 standards in the US, and taking into account competitiveness and growth considerations, the PRA, having consulted with HM Treasury, has decided to further delay implementation of the rules.\u201d\n\nShares in UK banks rose at the open on Friday morning, with Barclays up 1.7 per cent, Lloyds 1.2 per cent and NatWest 1 per cent.\n\nThe move reflects mounting pressure from the UK government on regulators to find ways of reducing the burden of bureaucracy in a push to support British economic growth and competitiveness. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told international investors last year he would \u201crip up the bureaucracy that blocks investment\u201d in the UK.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves is meeting the heads of many of the UK\u2019s main regulators this month, including PRA chief executive Sam Woods, to call for rule changes that will boost growth in the stagnant British economy.\n\nWoods told a House of Lords committee last week that the PRA planned to ease the burden of regulation by allowing insurers to seek retrospective permission for their investments, rather than forcing them to ask beforehand. He said it also aimed to cut banks\u2019 reporting requirements this year, having already cut them by a third for insurers.\n\nThe PRA said on Friday it had paused its plans to start collecting data on the extra capital buffers it sets for each bank, known as Pillar 2 requirements, which had been due to be completed by the end of March.\n\nBut the UK\u2019s one-year delay to the start of the stricter Basel capital rules will not change the ultimate end point for when they fully come into force. The PRA said the transition period would be compressed to keep the final implementation date at January 2030.\n\nThe UK move follows the EU\u2019s decision last year to press ahead with introducing some of the Basel rules this month, while postponing the part of its package that covers investment banks\u2019 trading books by a further year.\n\nThe UK Finance trade body welcomed the PRA\u2019s \u201cpragmatic\u201d announcement, saying: \u201cGiven the cross-border nature of banking, international co-ordination on capital rules is important.\u201d\n\nSteven Hall, a partner at consultancy KPMG, said the\u00a0PRA\u2019s delay would leave the EU \u201cfurther out of line\u201d with the UK and US. \u201cFor UK banks, this leaves them time to either \u2018do things properly\u2019, or take their foot off the gas, expecting further delays down the line,\u201d he said.\n\nUS bank bosses celebrated last year after the Fed cut in half the planned increase in capital requirements for the sector to 9 per cent, and was then unable to win necessary approval from other regulators even for this.\n\nMichael Barr, who oversaw the Basel Endgame proposals as vice-chair for supervision at the Fed, said this month he was stepping down from the role while remaining a governor, opening the door for a more business-friendly official to be appointed under Trump.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6a8e9171-8560-400d-bca8-0d6812c59fb3"}}, {"id": "c09123ad-57c7-4918-87a5-52904f68d742", "event_name": "UK to raise price of travel permits for EU visitors by 60%", "blurb": "Increase aims to reduce reliance of migration and borders system on taxpayer funding, says Home Office", "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0", "body": "The price of travel permits needed by EU and US citizens to enter the UK is to rise from \u00a310 to \u00a316, the government said, triggering warnings that the cost will damage tourism.\n\nSince the electronic travel authorisation scheme took effect this month, many visitors to the UK who do not require a visa have to apply for digital permission to travel to the country.\n\nVisitors at present pay \u00a310 for a permit that is valid for two years and allows them to take multiple journeys.\n\nBut the Home Office said the cost of a permit would rise from \u00a310 to \u00a316 to help \u201creduce the reliance of the migration and borders system on taxpayer funding\u201d.

Richard Milne\n\nA quiet music sanctuary 10 minutes from Central Park, this store offers vintage records from acclaimed names such as Miles Davis to lesser-known jazz artists like Zoot Sims. Ask manager Bruce Eder for expert recommendations on its collection, which spans classical, jazz, soul, disco and more.

Opened in 2023 by Sicilian-native Massimiliano Diliberto Paulsen, the shop is a haven from the tourist crowds and organises musical showcases while serving proper Italian coffees. Ben Marino\n\nThis store certainly lives up to its name: its basketball court-sized main room in the Swedish capital is crammed full of vinyl from just about every genre, a great collection of 7in singles, and plenty of other nostalgia from film posters to Dinky Toys. Next door, Trash Palace covers heavy metal and punk music. The records are decently priced, and alongside most of the classics, there is a decent sprinkling of rarities. I\u2019ve picked up obscure Led Zeppelin live albums, Congolese soukous, and \u201990s indie here. RM\n\nSounds of the Universe, which occupies a prime corner site in Soho, doubles as the HQ of Soul Jazz Records and stocks the label\u2019s huge back catalogue of reissues and compilations. The shop is also a destination for DJs, with stock in a range of genres from reggae and jazz, through hip hop, Afrobeat and house, to Krautrock and the early 1980s New York avant-garde. Jonathan Derbyshire\n\nHidden down an alleyway opposite the splendour of Great Malvern Priory, Carnival Records is a great symbol of a slew of provincial record shops that have sprung up in recent years across the UK, offering friendly service and a decent spread of used and new vinyl, including boxsets. Carnival has a second room of cheaper vinyl for extra digging. RM\n\nA single bloodshot eye stares at the buses that stop outside the romanesque-style Queen Victoria Building shopping arcade inviting people down to one of the last bastions of Sydney\u2019s once-thriving underground (literally) music scene. Red Eye Records has been operating since 1981 around town and has retained the feel of a traditionally chaotic music store. Its blood-red walls are plastered with heritage tour posters and expensive rarities. But unlike the new generation of vinyl-only music stores, the high-priced new vinyl releases, rarities and used oddities are still accompanied by racks of music books and CDs, which, the store says, still sell well to both young and old who can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, spend $80 on a new piece of vinyl. Nic Fildes\n\nThe shop belies its compact nature in a residential street to offer Copenhagen\u2019s best vinyl experience. The selection of records is eclectic but does not aim for completeness. Instead, Tim Rose is one of the friendliest and chattiest record shop owners, and offers everything from Kiss and Bj\u00f6rk to world music and even some vintage football tops. They offer a bigger selection online on Discogs too. RM\n\nI stumbled upon this store\u2019s startling fa\u00e7ade near Carnaby Street last summer. The store was bustling with fans of Jack White \u2013 the musician behind the shop and its eponymous label \u2013 who had just released his album. I walked in looking for No Name\u2019s blues-punk tunes but stayed to explore a selection of live gigs recorded directly on vinyl, along with unissued music like Martin Solis\u2019 rich Tejano sounds. EL\n\nThe Oxford branch of \u201cOxfordshire\u2019s longest-running independent record store\u201d on the Cowley Road attracts student hipsters and musos alike. It shares its space with the independent coffee shop Mostro, so you can get your flat white fix while browsing the new releases and tightly curated second-hand section. A small in-store stage showcases live performances by local talent. AT\n\nSituated in the heart of Kazimierz, this is one of a number of hip shops in the historic Jewish quarter of Krak\u00f3w. Named after perhaps the Beastie Boys\u2019 best record, the store offers a decent collection of Polish jazz \u2013 one of the best and most vibrant scenes on the continent \u2013 as well as jazz and hip hop. The staff are knowledgeable and helpful, even opening on a holiday for me to collect some records. RM\n\nCome for the comprehensive edit of contemporary indie, rock and dance records \u2013 stay for the 200 gigs a year the shop puts on, whether in its intimate onsite space, the Pryzm nightclub around the corner or St John\u2019s Church on the outskirts of town. Tickets are not expensive and sometimes free when you buy an album. While many record stores rightly cherish the past, Banquet feels like it\u2019s got its eye on the future. AT\n\nBudapest\u2019s best record shop feels small, but is so well curated that there are hours of digging fun to be had. Everything from Hungarian prog music to techno and Indian raga is represented, and there\u2019s a special selection of pressings from behind the old Iron Curtain. There is no turntable to listen to discs, but the staff will play your records on the main system. RM\n\nThis electronic music-focused store has been around in some form or another since the mid-1990s. It\u2019s an absolute mainstay of the dance scene in the north of England. Breen Turner\n\nRun out of Portobello Road for a half century, Honest Jon\u2019s has expanded to an excellent record label (home to the fabulous London Is The Place For Me compilations) as well as a wonderful but tiny second shop in Coal Drops Yard by King\u2019s Cross. The shop majors in jazz, soul, and what it calls Outernational music that is well curated and always full of surprises. RM\n\nNot much is left of north-west London\u2019s 1970s reggae scene, though in Harlesden there are two originals: Starlight Records and Hawkeye Enterprises. Neither is in mint condition, with Starlight reduced to a corridor by a money changers and Hawkeye an annexe to Caribbean bakery, but their place in Black British music history deserves respect. Bryce Elder\n\nThe Cotswold town of Stroud has no fewer than three great record shops \u2013 all arguably better than those in the bigger towns in Gloucestershire \u2013 and Klang Tone might be the best of them. Reflecting owner Sean Roe\u2019s eclectic tastes from Japanese music and Afrobeat to far-out jazz and reggae, Klang Tone is well suited to finding discs you have never heard of and never knew you wanted. RM\n\nSituated in the nightlife-heavy inner suburb of Prahran is an institution; the shop has been on Greville Street since 1979 and has survived the downturns in vinyl, cassettes and CDs to thrive once again on vinyl. It was originally set up as an alternative to conservative music shops that did not stock overseas punk and metal records and has been around long enough to see those genres enter the mainstream. It now caters to pretty much any taste you care to name. The shop \u2013 which smells like old records \u2013 is gloriously crowded with crates, handwritten dividers and musical paraphernalia everywhere you turn. It is also a great place to spot local and touring musicians that swing by to catch up with the well-connected owner Warwick Brown. NF\n\nLisbon is a great place to find music from across the Lusophone world, and its flea markets have plenty of gems from Cabo Verde, Angola, Brazil, and Guinea-Bissau. The best record store though is Flur, home to plenty of discs, many of them local and inspired by the former Portuguese colonies. RM\n\nTucked away on the eighth floor of a nondescript office building in the West 20s in Manhattan, Jazz Records is a veritable Aladdin\u2019s cave for jazz heads, with an immaculately curated range of both new and secondhand albums. The inaccessibility and vague air of secrecy just add to the allure. I spent $100 in there on a recent visit, but could easily have dropped a thousand. JD\n\nDown a side street off La Rambla, Barcelona City Records is one of Europe\u2019s best shops to pick up Latin records. I recently filled my boots with fabulous pressings from Colombia\u2019s legendary Discos Fuentes and some other 1960s cumbia discs. But there\u2019s plenty else. RM\n\nVinyl Whistle, with its fully licensed cafe, DJ nights and live performances from established names such as former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler as well as up-and-coming local acts, fits in perfectly in Leeds\u2019s vibrant Headingley. A city with a rich musical tradition, Leeds has produced famous names including indie rockers Kaiser Chiefs and soul singer Corinne Bailey Rae. The new and secondhand records at Vinyl Whistle offer a similar breadth of genres. Lukanyo Mnyanda\n\nAn institution \u2013 especially for keeping up with live music. You can really get a sense of how important live music is to Jumbo by how many gig listings are on the front page of their site, alongside the expected vinyl releases. They sell a little bit of everything and they\u2019re very good at it. BT\n\nSince the demise of the much-missed Crocojazz on the Left Bank, this Haut Marais institution is just about the best place for serious jazz lovers to hunt for vinyl in Paris. You might also find yourself distracted here by the sumptuous selection of music from Francophone Africa and Latin and Lusophone America, as well as from countries across Europe. If anywhere\u2019s going to have that album of cold war-era Czech library music you\u2019ve been searching for, it\u2019s Superfly. JD\n\nThorne Records, with its bright yellow exterior, is hard to miss among the specialty shops and restaurants in the fashionable Edinburgh neighbourhood of Bruntsfield. Customers \u2013 from local residents to university students to tourists \u2013 have access to a wide collection of \u201cpopular\u201d music from the 1950s to the latest Taylor Swift. If you still cannot find what you are looking for, owner Mark Thorne will search far and wide, in line with his motto that every customer should leave happier than when they arrived. LM\n\nLocated just off Oslo\u2019s main shopping drag and across the road from Norway\u2019s parliament, it\u2019s a cavernous store chock full of thousands of used vinyl (and CDs). Some of the rarer discs are at suitably Norwegian prices, but the rest is decently priced and there are plenty of rarities. RM\n\nIts founder having caught the revival and built a business selling vinyl online, Assai opened its first physical shop in a Dundee suburb in 2015 then moved into the city centre four years later. In-store performances by local bands and hard-to-find pressings, including an exclusive range with Japanese-style \u201cobi\u201d paper strips, have helped build its reputation as a tastemaker as well as a community hub. BE\n\nIt\u2019s the brainchild of record dealers Xavier Ehretsmann and Vincent Privat; the duo met at a record fair and, in 2019, joined forces on their own bricks-and-mortar space \u2013 a cultural hub for kids and adults alike \u2013 near Paris\u2019 Montmartre neighbourhood, followed by a second outpost in Marseille. Their selection is eclectic; from French boogie to folk and afro/cosmic beats, they also stock vintage books and posters, including a highly coveted collection of \u201crave flyers\u201d from cities across the world. In\u00e8s Cross\n\nNew York may be over and the glory days long gone, but Academy Records is still hopping. Opened in the late 1970s, this warren of lightly used treasures offers a surprisingly broad catalogue of vinyl, DVDs and Blu-Rays. Not to mention the best selection of classical music in the city. For the most part, prices seem to be from another, better era, too. Matt Vella\n\nRough Trade renewed its central London presence last October, 17 years after it shut its basement store in Covent Garden. The Denmark Street store is much smaller than its flagship Brick Lane outlet, but offers a well curated selection of vinyl and CDs, and hosts gigs, book signings and listening parties. One suggestion for the independent chain though: Peter Watts\u2019 recent book about the street\u2019s pivotal role in the UK music industry would be a wise title to stock. Murray Withers\n\nWalking into Amoeba\u2019s flagship in Berkeley requires passing under an enormous painted rainbow \u2013 a fitting entry onto hallowed ground. America\u2019s largest (and best) independently owned record store is located at ground zero of the US free speech and anti-war movements, and the spirit of iconoclastic rebellion is alive and well inside. The huge selection of vinyl is priced to move and turns over daily so, even on a short timeframe, repeat visits are usually worth making. It also has locations in San Francisco and Los Angeles. MV\n\nIn the corner of Baytree Garden Centre, beside the owl sanctuary and a showroom of wood-burning stoves, are approximately a quarter of a million second-hand records. Uptown is intimidating. You\u2019d need at least a day to get through the four rooms, which cover every genre and value, from one-off private pressings to bins of singles for 50p each. If you want it, Uptown probably has it, though good luck finding it. BE\n\nSound Station\u2019s unassuming shopfront calls to mind the opposite of Salieri\u2019s description of the Adagio movement from Mozart\u2019s Serenade No 10. A rusty squeeze box this ain\u2019t. Inside, you\u2019ll find Denmark\u2019s best-stocked record store with an enormous selection of rare and collectable vinyl. The new LP section is bountiful too. The chances of leaving the Station without something on your list are nearly nil. MV\n\nVisiting Jazzhole, a quaint little shop in the wealthy Ikoyi neighbourhood of Lagos, can sometimes feel like travelling back in time. Despite its being located on a busy thoroughfare, the world slows down inside as you become surrounded by an impressive collection of vinyls of Nigerian greats and African records. It doubles as a bookshop with a reliable supply of global and African literature classics and magazines from a different era. It\u2019s an intimate space that serves as part caf\u00e9 and part treasure trove. Aanu Adeoye\n\nMost record retailers favour order, with crates carefully arranged by label or genre and new releases displayed like trophies behind the counter. The Thing, a basement thrift store in Brooklyn, is chaos. Records are stacked on top of each other with careless abandon. Digging might turn up anything, though is sure to leave a layer of dust on your fingers. Social media fame means the stock is picked over for rarities these days, but the experience remains grimily authentic. BE\n\nCo-founded by the French-Taiwanese DJ Louise Chen with the aim of creating a welcoming and laidback space for music nerds, this airy 11th-arrondissement spot is one of the less intimidating record stores to visit. With a mix of second-hand and new records, and a m\u00e9lange of genres, it regularly hosts listening parties and private collection sales with music insiders such as Desire Records founder J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mestre. It also has a hifi repair workshop on the same block. Ellie Pithers\n\nFounded in 1971, Digelius attained legendary status among Helsinki\u2019s vinyl collectors before being taken over in 2023 by the successful local We Jazz label. That ensures that it covers the hip end of modern releases from both local and international artists, but there is a decent second-hand offering, particularly of jazz but also of classical and world music. RM\n\nA short walk from East Putney tube, this tiny shop, which used to be the location of the shop owner\u2019s hairdresser, is packed full of soul and jazz records and CDs. Laurence Prangell, who started selling records with his brother Malcolm at record fairs in the late 1980s, opened the store in 1994 and quickly established a loyal following of vinyl collectors from around the world who come to him for rare issues of American funk and soul artists. Soul Brother also has a record label dedicated to re-issues, most famously a Marlena Shaw anthology.

Kemi Badenoch gave a big speech yesterday setting out where she thinks the UK is going wrong, how the government is failing and how she will change the Conservative party to win again.\n\nWell, after a fashion: Badenoch\u2019s ability to set that definition is hamstrung by her self-denying ordinance not to set out policies.\n\nBadenoch is half-right that almost all policy proposals that she or the Conservative party make now will be redundant by the time of the next election.\n\nThat date could be almost as far in the future from today as the first reported case \u201cof a pneumonia of an unknown type\u201d in Wuhan is from the present. By the time of the next general election, Donald Trump\u2019s second term as US president will either be over or nearing its end. No fewer than eight member states will have shuffled in and out of the rotating presidency of the EU in that time. An awful lot could happen between now and then.\n\nBut what she is missing is that well-chosen policies are part of how you signal your underlying principles. Let\u2019s take the three shadow cabinet ministers who are, I think, doing the best job of signalling what they are about. They aren\u2019t announcing policies but they are setting out a clear position: Laura Trott at shadow education is showing us that she thinks accountability and freedom are big drivers of how you improve public services. Robert Jenrick at shadow justice is showing that he favours authoritarian measures on law and order. And Claire Coutinho at shadow energy and net zero is showing that she will describe any measures to reach net zero, including ones she herself signed off, as pandering to \u201cthe climate change lobby\u201d.\n\nThese are clear signals about where these shadow ministers would differ from the politicians they are opposing, where they want to fight the next election, and what about the last Conservative government they want to defend and what they want to disavow.\n\nBadenoch has been less clear: and one reason for that, I think, is she is simply not across the detail and sufficiently prepared to do the necessary legwork to be an effective leader of the opposition. Some thoughts on one example of that below.\n\nKemi Badenoch has a repeated argument about the British state and by extension about the Conservative record these past 14 years: that the UK state needs to focus on doing a little well, as opposed to a lot badly. (Or as she put it yesterday: \u201cthe government is already doing too much \u2014 and it\u2019s doing it badly\u201d.)\n\nShe also has an interesting argument about means-testing the winter fuel allowance, an idea that Whitehall officials presented to the Conservatives \u201ctime and again\u201d. She criticised Rachel Reeves, saying the chancellor opted to do it because \u201cshe has no ideas of her own\u201d. Means-testing the winter fuel allowance was a Conservative manifesto commitment in the 2017 election, it is the programme that Badenoch was first elected to parliament on. There is much that you can reasonably say both to criticise or to defend Theresa May and Nick Timothy, the authors of that manifesto, but I just don\u2019t think \u201cno ideas of their own\u201d is a credible or serious one.\n\nMaybe \u2014 and I\u2019m just spitballing here \u2014 maybe the reason why officials kept suggesting that the government means-test the winter fuel allowance and the reason why May wanted to do it in 2017 is also the reason why our new Labour government did it, which is that it is a reasonable suggestion.\n\nWhen Gordon Brown introduced the winter fuel allowance in 1997, pensioners were the poorest cohort in the UK. They are now the richest. It is also a benefit that has stayed the same in cash terms as it was in 2000, rather like the \u201cChristmas bonus\u201d that is paid to some benefit recipients and pensioners. This bonus was \u00a310 when Edward Heath introduced it, was \u00a310 when it was made permanent in 1979 and is \u00a310 today. This is a really silly way to spend money! We are handing a benefit of diminishing value to an ever-wealthier group for no particular reason.\n\nIf you think that the British government does \u201ctoo much\u201d, you have to seriously engage with what it actually does, and much of what it does is provide services to older people. Now, I think that\u2019s perfectly fine. As regular readers will know I don\u2019t have much time for arguments about intergenerational unfairness when it comes to the provision of government services. Most of us cost a great deal from when we are born to when we leave compulsory education aged 18, and most of us will be net contributors to the public purse until the final decades of our life. This isn\u2019t \u201cintergenerational unfairness\u201d: this is just fairness. Most of us over the age of 18 do not need more state provision and won\u2019t until we are considerably older. If you want a lean and efficient state, it is hard to argue that a universal benefit introduced in 1997 is a non-negotiable part of it.\n\n(There is a different argument to be made about the housing market which I will return to in a later email.)\n\nNow here\u2019s the Badenoch argument: the way that Reeves has done this, by pegging the point at which you receive the winter fuel allowance, means pensioners \u201con the breadline\u201d are losing out. But that\u2019s an argument for increasing the threshold for pension credit, not for a cash benefit of ever diminishing value to be paid out to more pensioners than receive pension credit.\n\nWhen Badenoch talks of means-testing, she seems to envisage some kind of perfect model with no edge cases, telling LBC\u2019s Iain Dale that \u201cmeans-testing is something we don\u2019t do properly here\u201d, that we \u201cdon\u2019t have a system that knows who should get what\u201d. That is to say, she thinks that the British state needs to spend more money in order to work out who it should give money to. There\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with this argument but if you claim that you want government to do less and you can\u2019t even support this very simple reduction in a universal benefit, and if you want a yet more complex benefit system, you are not a serious small-state politician.\n\nBadenoch then went further, telling Dale that the Conservatives are also \u201clooking at\u201d means testing the \u201ctriple lock\u201d pension, the same day that she had insisted that only a government with \u201cno ideas\u201d would means-test the winter fuel allowance.\n\nThe \u201ctriple lock pension\u201d is a mechanism not a benefit. It is the solution that successive British governments since the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition have chosen to the problem that the UK state pension is not generous compared with its peers. As a mechanism it has downsides, not least that people start to see it as something that should go on forever and ever rather than a phased solution to a particular public policy problem.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear what it would even mean to \u201cmeans-test\u201d the process whereby we increase the size of the state pension by whichever is the highest out of 2.5 per cent, inflation, or earnings growth. The question of whether you means-test the state pension is not the same as how you ensure that the state pension provides a decent income for the people who need it.\n\nMeans-testing it does in theory allow you to be more generous to those who get it, but the reason why the Tories did not opt to do this is that doing so dissuades people from saving for their own retirement. I am not saying they were necessarily right to do so, but I\u2019m struck that once again Badenoch\u2019s grasp on what her government did and why it did it is not what one would hope.\n\nIf she wants to lead a government that is smaller and more efficient than either the last Conservative government or the present Labour one, she needs to engage much more deeply with what both those governments did and why.\n\n(Georgina writes:) I first read Sam Selvon\u2019s The Lonely Londoners during my first months living away from home. The 1956 novel\u2019s rhythms, prickly sensations and tragicomic shifts perfectly captured the feeling of being an \u201coutsider\u201d \u2014 showing the Windrush-era newcomers adjust to the city as individual Londoners, and not bundling them up into a narrowly defined immigrant group. \u201cThey only laughing because they fraid to cry\u201d is one of my favourite lines.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to expect of the stage adaptation \u2014 and how it would respond to the book\u2019s musicality and creolised English \u2014 but I was blown away.

Goldman\u2019s portfolio strategy team put together this chart depicting quite how terrible it was, showing the quantum of the hit taken by a mix of UK stocks, gilts and currency.\n\nSure, the chart starts only in 2022, but oooof?\n\nThat the sell-off in UK bonds was part of a global bond move doesn\u2019t help the total return of gilt holders. But we\u2019re not here to spill more pixels on bonds. Louis has already done amazing work putting the relative yield moves of gilts \u2014 as well as the magnitude of the daily shifts in sterling \u2014 into historical context. But we thought it worth updating the FX-curious as to quite how weak the pound has become.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written previously, it\u2019s pretty easy to make a currency look weak or strong, depending on the point you\u2019re trying to make. Keen to tell a story of sterling despair in an age of dollar strength? Cable is the answer! Perhaps a tale of sterling resilience during a period of euro weakness? Sterling-euro is your friend.\n\nIf you want a more sensible truly cross-rate agnostic measure you could look at the Broad Sterling Effective Exchange Rate series calculated each day by the Bank of England.\n\nUsing this measure we can see how sterling has tracked over the last quarter of a century. We\u2019ve split it by prime ministers, and the big hits taken by sterling from the global financial crisis, the EU referendum, and Liz Truss all stand out. So far, the hit to sterling somewhat breathlessly reported by some of the media is less apparent.\n\nBut how many people really know what a broad effective exchange rate even is? Real, non-finance, people that is.\n\nLuckily, as keen readers will recall, our heuristic that sterling\u2019s broad effective exchange rate can be proxied to a 60:40 mix of euros and dollars continues to deliver with stunningly high levels of confidence.\n\nAnd so we thought it a good moment to revive and update one of our favourite charts, first wheeled out in July 2023, to help answer the question as to how weak or strong sterling is in nice simple terms. The chart that maps sterling\u2019s nominal value against both US dollars and euros, and only really works if you turn it on its side.\n\nAs a reminder, sterling moves to either the left or right along the horizontal lines of our rotated chart are manifestations of changes in EUR-USD rather than any strength or weakness of sterling per se.\n\nSure, this might mean sterling weakening (strengthening) against the US dollar (or euro) while strengthening (weakening) against the euro (or US dollar). But the broad effective exchange rate of sterling will remain pretty much unchanged.\n\nBy contrast, the (sort of) vertical lines on the rotated chart show where sterling crosses are for each given level of EUR-USD. Sterling can travel up or down any of these lines without the EUR-USD rate changing a basis point. Such vertical moves show genuine sterling strength (higher) or weakness (lower) in action.\n\nIn terms of levels, the latest reading is around 17 per cent weaker than the average rate under Blair, but around 7 per cent stronger than the average under May. It\u2019s 4 per cent stronger than the average under Boris Johnson, and 2 per cent stronger than the average under Rishi Sunak. It would be callous to compare sterling values to those experienced during Truss\u2019s brief tenure (9 per cent stronger).\n\nOf course, if last week\u2019s move (around 1.5 per cent weaker) is just a taste of things to come this will soon not be true. But overall the impact of sterling moves so far look a bit\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. meh?", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f89e0259-89f3-4ffc-8c7f-8877d740d6f5"}}, {"id": "41a019f6-f593-4bd1-ae08-1a113ad2c53a", "event_name": "UK companies outpace US counterparts in share buybacks", "blurb": "FTSE groups adopt practice criticised by lawmakers although research suggests it could lift long-term stock prices", "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0", "body": "British companies are buying back their shares at a faster rate than even US groups, adopting a practice that has drawn criticism for allegedly detracting from investment and innovation and come under fire from lawmakers in both countries.\n\nFTSE 100 companies made commitments to buy back at least \u00a356.9bn of shares last year, according to investment platform AJ Bell, having pledged to repurchase more than \u00a350bn of their stock in 2023 and 2022.\n\nAs a proportion of the market, 44 per cent of large companies in the UK reduced their share count by at least 1 per cent in 2024, pushing it ahead of the US, at 39 per cent, for the first time, according to calculations by fund firm Schroders using MSCI indices.\n\n\u201cWe seem to be going all guns blazing at the share buyback,\u201d said Adrian Gosden, a UK equity income manager at Jupiter Asset Management in London.\n\nThe trend marks a shift in thinking among UK companies, which have historically favoured dividends as a way of returning money to shareholders, making the British market attractive to income investors.\n\nAt the end of October oil major Shell committed to another $3.5bn of share buybacks, taking its total last year to more than \u00a310bn. In July, HSBC unveiled a $3bn buyback amid better than expected profits. British Gas owner Centrica in December said it would add \u00a3300mn to its existing buyback programme, bringing total planned repurchases to \u00a31.5bn.\n\nIn a buyback, a company purchases its own shares in the market and then cancels them or holds them in storage, known as treasury. If it cancels them, this reduces the number of shares outstanding and therefore increases earnings per share.\n\nExecutives typically conduct buybacks if they believe there are no attractive acquisitions to be made or to signal that the stock is undervalued.\u00a0Repurchases also tend to be more tax-efficient than dividends.\n\nThe value of dividends paid out by FTSE 100 companies grew steadily throughout the 2010s but had remained roughly flat since the coronavirus pandemic, according to figures from AJ Bell, as UK companies increasingly favour the flexibility of one-off buybacks.\n\n\u201cDividends are seen as a commitment,\u201d said Alvin Chen, a researcher at the Stockholm School of Economics. Unexpectedly lowering a dividend \u201cis seen by the market as a terrible thing\u201d.\n\nEven a special dividend did not deliver the same advantages as a buyback because it did not send the same signal to the market that the company believed its shares were undervalued, Chen added.\n\nInvestors said the rise in UK buybacks could be linked to the comparatively low valuations of much of the London stock market, which has in recent years fallen behind many of its international peers. The FTSE 100 rose 5.7 per cent last year compared with the S&P\u2019s 23.3 per cent rise. The UK benchmark is trading on a forward price/earnings ratio of 11.2 times earnings, against the US index\u2019s 21.4 times, according to LSEG data.\n\nBuybacks also provide a way for UK companies to provide support to their share prices, helping counter years of investor outflows.\n\nBut some investors say buybacks simply deliver a short-term sugar high for earnings per share metrics used to calculate executive pay, rather than a sustainable boost to shareholder returns or an improvement in the company\u2019s operating performance.\n\nAcademics say assessing whether a buyback will boost long-term shareholder value is complex and riddled with unknowns. For instance, they say, it is unclear if the money could have been better spent on research \u2014 for instance, inventing a new blockbuster product \u2014 or acquiring a competitor, raising staff pay or recruiting talent.\n\nNevertheless, most in-depth studies have found that, on average, groups that repurchase their own shares typically outperform those that do not. The S&P 500 Buyback index \u2014 an equal-weighted index of the 100 stocks in the US benchmark S&P 500 index that spend the highest share of their cash repurchasing their shares relative to their market capitalisation \u2014 has outperformed the broader S&P 500 Equal Weight index in 14 of the past 20 years, including in 2024.\n\nHowever, it was difficult to infer causality, according to Alice Bonaim\u00e9, an associate professor of finance at the University of Arizona. \u201cDid the companies outperform the market because of the repurchase? Or were the outperformers the ones with extra cash on hand ready to be used in a repurchase programme?\u201d\n\nAt a minimum, however, \u201cit doesn\u2019t look like repurchases destroy long-term shareholder value\u201d, she said.\n\nAlberto Manconi, an associate professor of finance at Milan\u2019s Bocconi University, has similarly found\u00a0that buybacks \u201cdon\u2019t hurt\u201d long-term shareholders. His research, which compared the total returns of 9,000 companies between 1998 and 2010 following buyback announcements, found that repurchases were generally followed by \u201cpositive long-run excess returns\u201d, with the greatest benefits accruing to \u201csmall, beaten-up, value stocks\u201d.\n\nBut some lawmakers and academics say that rather than trying to boost share prices, companies should instead be spending excess cash on innovation or investment.\n\nPlane maker Boeing, which is struggling to turn around its finances, has come under fire for conducting about $44bn of buybacks between 2013 and 2019 rather than investing the money in improving its operations. It declined to comment on the criticism.\n\n\u201cAs this really extreme example of shareholder primacy, [buybacks] have this real harm of moving corporations away from investment,\u201d said Lenore Palladino, an assistant professor of economics and public policy at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.\n\nGervais Williams, head of equities at Premier Miton Investors, said he did not \u201cblame\u201d companies buying back shares when valuations were low, \u201cbut that means they\u2019re investing less in the community [and] in skilled employment\u201d.\n\nAhead of November\u2019s US election, President Joe Biden\u2019s team proposed quadrupling the levy on buybacks it implemented in 2022 as part of efforts to make big corporations \u201cpay their fair share\u201d. Incoming president Donald Trump made no such campaign promises, although in 2020 he said he was \u201cnever happy\u201d that companies were using excess cash to buy back their shares.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Liberal Democrats last year called for a 4 per cent tax on buybacks, arguing that \u201cinstead of reinvesting their profits in skills, equipment or clean technology, many big corporations are just buying back shares to inflate their own share price\u201d.\n\nOthers counter that there is little evidence that capital spent on buybacks will be redirected to investment in research, acquisitions, staff pay or expansion.\n\nFor the London market, the rise of buybacks showed it was becoming \u201cmore international\u201d, particularly given that US investors \u201care more comfortable with buybacks\u201d, said Charles Hall, head of research at UK broker Peel Hunt.\n\nIn 2022, a record 57.7 per cent of the value of the UK stock market was held by overseas investors, according to official data.\n\n\u201cIt also reflects the fact that UK companies, by historic standards, are very good value,\u201d Hall said. \u201cGiven where valuations are [in the UK] at the moment, share buybacks look pretty sensible.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by George Steer", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/30560ebb-da28-4038-8f1d-f6fc6c0b30f5"}}, {"id": "784fc7b0-f435-4bc5-b1e7-514f90d81e96", "event_name": "The Big Question: why are people having fewer babies?", "blurb": "With fertility rates falling and populations of some countries shrinking, multiple causes could be behind the trend", "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0", "body": "As healthcare systems buckle under the weight of ageing populations, one area of care is forecast to have a lighter load: maternity units.\n\nThe global birth rate has plummeted since the 1950s, when women had an average of 4.7 children, to 2.3 births per woman today. If this trend continues, more than 23 nations are expected to see their populations halve by 2100.\n\nThe fall in fertility rates is most pronounced in developed nations: for example, the birth rate in England and Wales stands at 1.44 per woman, the lowest ever recorded \u2014 while populations are already shrinking in several OECD member states, including Japan, Italy and Greece, among others.\n\nBut what exactly is driving this steep decline? Research has historically shown a link between a mother\u2019s education and birth rate \u2014 with highly educated women more likely to have fewer children, and to do so later in life. However, more recent studies by Oxford university have shown that fertility rates are now declining across all educational groups.\n\nOne reason for fewer births could also be the opportunity cost for mothers at work. Researchers have suggested that the \u201cmotherhood penalty\u201d makes up more than 80 per cent of the gender pay gap \u2014 with the discrepancy between men and women only widening significantly when women hit their thirties and start having children.\n\nEconomic factors, such as the cost of raising a family, including childcare and housing costs, are also a factor. Rising housing costs in the UK now mean Gen Z faces twice as high costs as previous generations \u2014 while the average price of a nursery place for children under two years old is now \u00a315,000 a year.\n\nIn addition to economic factors, changes in attitudes are also at play. Many millennials, or those born between 1981 and 1996, report feeling unprepared for parenthood, or not having found a suitable partner to have children with, as cited in research by the UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies. The UCL report said that only one in four British millennials who say they want children are trying for them.\n\nSo, with so many factors at play, what do you think is the biggest cause for this decline?

For example, information on unclassified roads only gathered from local authorities on a voluntary four-yearly basis, despite accounting for 62 per cent of mileage on local highways.\n\n\u201cOur inquiry shows government are having to find out about these issues from industry bodies and road users themselves due to their own patchy data,\u201d the committee said.\n\nSince 2020-21, the department has provided local authorities with funding from the Potholes Fund \u2014 one of twelve funds allocated to local authorities for maintenance \u2014 which is expected to total \u00a32.2bn\u00a0by the end of 2024-25.\n\nAlongside a one-off top-up in 2023-24, specific pothole funding from the department represented 40 per cent of capital funding to local authorities in that year.\n\nAn additional \u00a3500mn for road maintenance, aiming to fix a further one million pot holes across England was announced in the autumn Budget.\n\nAccording to the Road Haulage Association, planned works cost an average of 35 per cent less than reactive repairs in England, the report said.\n\nThe RHA added that short-term maintenance, including temporarily fixing potholes, had caused money to be \u201cwasted\u201d.\n\nThe report found there were also continuing problems with infrastructure projects, reporting an increase in delays as well as falling out of the scope of their budgets.\n\nThe Department for Transport said: \u201cFor far too long our roads have been left to crumble, and this report has laid bare the result of the decades of decline we have inherited in our road infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re investing a record \u00a31.6 billion for the coming year to help local authorities fix up to seven million more potholes.\n\n\u201cRoad users are rightly frustrated by patchwork repairs, so we are also committed to multiyear funding settlements to enable councils to better maintain their road networks and avoid potholes forming in the first place.\u201d\n\nAdam Hug from the Local Government Association said: \u201cGreater, long-term funding certainty for local highways authorities \u2014 with five yearly funding allocations on a par with national highways \u2014 is needed to tackle the multibillion pound local roads backlog.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will enable councils to far more effectively plan for and invest in preventive treatments, which keep surfaces in better condition for longer.\n\nThe MPs\u2019 report came the day after new figures showed that only a small fraction of the UK\u2019s national infrastructure projects are on time and within budget.\n\nThe Infrastructure Projects Authority, which oversees the progress of major schemes for the government, said on Thursday that the number of projects rated \u201cred\u201d for risk in 2023-24 had increased.\n\nOnly 25 green-rated projects, or just over one in ten, were deemed \u201chighly likely\u201d to be delivered on time and on budget.\n\nIt said that successful delivery currently \u201cappears to be unachievable\u201d for \u00a397bn of major schemes, many of them IT projects and key defence programmes such as the replacement of the Typhoon fighter jet.\n\nThree immigration projects were also rated red, including the rebuilding of the Manston detention centre and the creation of a new end-to-end immigration system, as well as the remaining phase of HS2.", "region_codes": ["UK"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/07050137-c881-4c6d-a07d-9bc8afedc08a"}}]
