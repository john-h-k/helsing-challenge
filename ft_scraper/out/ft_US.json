Absolutely,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey don\u2019t take our cars, they don\u2019t take our farm products, essentially, they don\u2019t take almost anything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have a tremendous deficit with the European Union. So we\u2019ll be doing something very substantial with the European Union.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s comments, coming less than two weeks after his return to the White House, marked a sharp escalation in his rhetoric on trade and mean the world\u2019s biggest economy is on the verge of imposing tariffs on its most significant trading partners.\n\nUS goods imports from the EU, Canada, Mexico and China were $1.9tn in 2023, about 60 per cent of the total, according to customs database Trade Data Monitor.\n\nThe European Commission said it was \u201cnot aware of any additional tariffs being imposed on EU products\u201d and said tariffs\u00a0\u201ccreate unnecessary economic disruption\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur trade and investment relationship with the US is the biggest in the world,\u201d said chief spokesperson Paula Pinho. \u201cOpen markets and respect for international trade rules are essential for strong and sustainable economic growth.\u201d\n\nTrump said he would also \u201ceventually\u201d put tariffs on chips and \u201cthings associated with chips\u201d, and would apply tariffs to oil, gas, steel, copper, aluminium and pharmaceuticals.\n\nTariffs on steel and aluminium could come as soon as \u201cthis month, next month\u201d, he said, while oil and gas tariffs would happen around February 18.\n\nThe US dollar strengthened on Trump\u2019s comments, leaving an index of the currency against six peers up about 0.6 per cent. West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, rose more than 1 per cent to $73.81 a barrel.\n\nTrump said he would \u201cprobably\u201d reduce the tariffs on Canadian oil to 10 per cent, although other imports from the country would be taxed at 25 per cent. Canada is by far the US\u2019s biggest foreign oil supplier, accounting for about 60 per cent of its crude imports.\n\nThe president said there was \u201cnothing\u201d Canada and Mexico could do overnight to prevent him from applying tariffs against their imports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a negotiating tool,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s pure economic. We have big deficits with, as you know, with all three of them.\u201d\n\nEconomists say sweeping tariffs would be inflationary and could prevent the Federal Reserve from reducing borrowing costs as much as anticipated this year. Some central bank officials had already started including Trump\u2019s policies in their forecasts in December, before he took office.\n\nHitting the US\u2019s biggest trading partners with steep tariffs sharply raises the risks of igniting full-blown trade wars just days into Trump\u2019s second term as president.\n\nBoth Canada and Mexico have prepared packages of retaliatory tariffs and are ready to implement them. The EU has also said it would defend itself with retaliatory tariffs, as it did in Trump\u2019s first term.\u201cWe\u2019re ready with a response \u2014 a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday. The Liberal premier warned Canadians that the nation \u201ccould be facing difficult times in the coming days and weeks\u201d.\n\nCanada\u2019s former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, who is running to replace Trudeau, on Friday urged Ottawa to retaliate against any US tariffs by adding huge levies on Tesla vehicles to punish Elon Musk, one of Trump\u2019s top allies.\n\nTrump indicated he was unmoved by economists\u2019 warnings that new tariffs would hurt the US economy or risk a leap in inflation as importers passed on the increased cost of their goods to consumers.\n\n\u201cTariffs don\u2019t cause inflation, they cause success,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Democrats warned much of the burden would be passed on to American consumers. \u201cDonald Trump is aiming his new tariffs at Mexico, Canada and China but they will likely hit Americans in their wallets,\u201d said Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader.\n\n\u201cIf these tariffs go into full effect, they will raise prices for everything from groceries, to cars, to gas, making it even harder for middle-class families to just get by.\u201d\n\nTrump first threatened to hit Canada, Mexico and China with steep tariffs in November, accusing them of allowing illegal migration and not doing enough to halt trade in fentanyl, an illegal and deadly opioid.\n\nBusiness lobbyists in Washington, worried about the effects on US supply chains and the costs of goods, had hoped that the president would take a more moderate approach and not immediately apply a 25 per cent levy.\n\nOther options included delaying the tariffs to allow the Canadian and Mexican governments more time to negotiate with the Trump team over border security, or introducing the tariffs gradually and increasing them over time.Additional reporting by Harriet Clarfelt", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ff8116f0-b01f-4687-934a-a1b8a07bd5b0"}}, {"id": "e7b2abc5-1a69-4773-ac85-c54ff5c3c29d", "event_name": "Former Federal Reserve official accused of passing secrets to China", "blurb": "Justice department alleges John Rogers accessed sensitive information including briefings and policy deliberations", "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0", "body": "A former senior Federal Reserve official was arrested on Friday after US prosecutors accused him of passing on economic secrets to China.\n\nJohn Rogers, a senior adviser in the Fed\u2019s international finance division from 2010-21, used his position to access sensitive data on China-related tariffs, briefings to officials and policy debates and announcements, according to an indictment unsealed on Friday in federal court in Washington.\n\nRogers, 63, of Virginia, was accused of transferring sensitive information to his personal email account before printing it out and passing it on to Chinese officials disguised as graduate students. He also used encrypted messaging apps to communicate with Chinese officials, the indictment said.\n\nThe justice department on Friday said Rogers had \u201cunder the guise of teaching \u2018classes\u2019,\u201d met his co-conspirators in Chinese hotel rooms where he gave them sensitive trade secret information that belonged to the Fed.\n\nIt added the economist had been paid about $450,000 as a part-time professor at Fudan University in China.\n\nRogers denies the allegations, his attorney said.\n\nThe indictment is the latest in a rising number of cases in which officials from across the US government \u2014 and particularly agencies such as the CIA and the military \u2014 have been charged with providing sensitive or secret information to the Chinese government.\n\nIn recent years, the justice department has also become more public about highlighting cases to underscore the threat from Chinese espionage. Washington has accused Chinese hackers of attacking US telecoms networks in a massive and widespread campaign that has allowed the perpetrators to access the conversations of American officials.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington said it was \u201cnot familiar\u201d with the specifics of the Rogers\u2019s case, but said China \u201cupholds the rule of law\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe oppose any smear and attack on China with so-called \u2018spy risks\u2019,\u201d the embassy added.\n\nThe Chinese government is one of the biggest global holders of US government bonds. Fed interest rate decisions and signals on future monetary policy movements can also influence US Treasuries and are among the most closely watched reports across global financial markets.\n\nUS Treasury figures show that, as of November, China officially held $768.6bn of the debt, making it the second-largest foreign holder after Japan.\n\nThe indictment alleges the sensitive information was shared from \u201cat least 2018\u201d with alleged Chinese co-conspirators \u201cwho worked for the intelligence and security apparatus of China and who posed as graduate students at a [Chinese] university\u201d.\n\nThe Fed declined to comment.\n\nRogers, who speaks limited Chinese, discussed teaching topics that would make the meetings seem \u201clegitimate in the eyes of the Fed\u201d, according to encrypted messages exchanged with his alleged co-conspirator that were cited in the indictment.\n\nRogers\u2019s travel was covered by his Chinese counterparts. \u201c[D]on\u2019t worry about the cost of the trip\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we don\u2019t waste money, but we can bear all the necessary cost, you can choose a comfortable and convenient way for the trip,\u201d an alleged co-conspirator said in a message included in the indictment.\n\nThe trade secrets at the heart of the case allegedly include the assessment of an European Central Bank announcement, briefing notes for a member of the Fed\u2019s board and a document titled \u201cPre-FOMC Briefing\u201d \u2014 all dated 2019.\n\nRogers in 2020 lied to the office of the Fed\u2019s inspector general when asked about his accessing and sharing of sensitive material, prosecutors said.\n\nLiza Tobin, a former National Security Council China director, said potential targets needed to be more vigilant about approaches from China.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s some career advice: if someone from a Chinese university offers you $450,000 for a part-time\u00a0job, run away,\u201d said Tobin, who is now a managing director at Garnaut Global, a geopolitical advisory firm. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting that kind of offer because of your brilliance and charm.\u201d", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1cf013ed-5e49-4925-acd4-3041eab6b028"}}, {"id": "ee9d242d-458c-4e89-a918-c4c967fce492", "event_name": "Trump\u2019s border crackdown traps migrants in Mexico", "blurb": "US border measures prompt rise in asylum applications in neighbouring country", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "Growing numbers of migrants who had been seeking to reach the US are instead making plans to stay in Mexico for long periods after US President Donald Trump launched a crackdown at the border.\n\nIn the border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the Jesuit Refugee Service, a non-profit offering legal and humanitarian assistance, has seen three times the number of people wanting its help to request asylum in Mexico this month as in all of 2024, said local branch director Alejandra Corona.\n\nMexican media showed long lines outside the offices of Mexico\u2019s asylum agency Comar in recent days, with more people trying to lodge applications to avoid detention by immigration authorities and secure a work permit.\n\n\u201cAsylum applications to Comar have increased in Tapachula and Mexico City in the last few days,\u201d said Giovanni Lepri, Mexico representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nIn his first week in office, Trump, who campaigned heavily on curbing migration, declared a national emergency at the southern border, sent 1,500 military personnel to help with enforcement, and cancelled his predecessor Joe Biden\u2019s legal pathways for entry.\n\nThe US has also launched highly publicised deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and begun regularly using military planes for deportation flights.\n\nOne factor sending migrants away from the border for the time being is Trump\u2019s scrapping of an app, CBP One, that had assigned 1,450 appointments a day to request asylum at regular ports of entry.\n\nAt the El Buen Pastor shelter in Ju\u00e1rez, occupancy grew from just 14 people to 60 after the cancellation of CBP One, said its director Pastor Juan Fierro.\n\nAmong those who lost their appointments was Luis, 30, a Venezuelan who spent his savings on the journey from his home country, which has been hit by an economic collapse under Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s repressive regime.\n\nLuis finally reached the US-Mexico border with his sister, girlfriend and other family members and secured an appointment to cross into the US and apply for asylum, but one day before his slot, Trump cancelled it.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing we could do, and we\u2019re stuck on this side, defeated,\u201d he said in Ju\u00e1rez.\n\nMany migrants are opting to stay in Mexico to try to get a job or request asylum. Mexico\u2019s capital is seen as a safer option than border areas, with more work opportunities and public transport.\n\n\u201cWe want to go to Mexico City to at least work, clear our minds as time passes,\u201d Luis said.\n\nFor the past year, cities along the US-Mexico border had been much quieter than previously, with shelters below capacity and irregular crossings down. That resulted from a crackdown by Mexican authorities, tighter US restrictions, and more legal pathways to cross through the app.\n\nBut for many migrants, returning home \u2014 whether to Venezuela, other countries in the region or parts of Mexico plagued by violence linked to drug cartels \u2014 is not an option. Many said they still hoped to reach the US eventually.\n\n\u201cGoing to the US is illogical, we can\u2019t get there\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but it\u2019s also dangerous here in Ju\u00e1rez,\u201d said Roxana, a 52-year-old from southern Mexico who said she had not yet decided where to go.\n\nGloria, a 54-year-old Guatemalan woman in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, said she believed Trump had not thought through the economic impact of his policies on industries such as agriculture, which rely on undocumented workers.\n\n\u201cGuatemala\u2019s men are men of corn, working men, the sun nor the rain stops them,\u201d she said. \u201cAre the Americans going to dare to go out to the fields to work?\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009The president should have thought of that.\u201d\n\nMexico\u2019s government has been creating shelters fit for 2,500 people each to take back deportees from the US.\u00a0Several organisations said the system was unusually efficient so far, but that there was no

Washington, which blew into the open after Trump said he would impose tariffs on the US\u2019s two biggest trading partners from February 1.\n\nThe White House on Friday reiterated its plan to impose

unavoidable political pressure on the White House,\u201d she said.\n\nCanada previously imposed 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, in a move that followed similar levies on Chinese EVs announced by Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nFreeland\u2019s comments also came as M\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, held last-gasp talks in Washington to try to avert Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nJoly used a Financial Times interview on Friday to warn the US that any disruption to energy flows between Canada and its southern neighbours triggered by a trade war would leave American oil refiners dependent on alternative heat oil supplies from Venezuela.\n\nJoly also vowed Canada would never become a \u201ccolony\u201d, in a reference to Trump\u2019s claims that Canadians would like to join the US and his repeated goading of Trudeau, who he has called a \u201cgovernor\u201d of the \u201c51st state\u201d.\n\nCanada and Mexico have drawn up lists of \u201ctit for tat\u201d tariffs to issue against the US as soon as Trump imposes tariffs.\n\nMexico\u2019s left-wing president Claudia Sheinbaum said earlier this week that she did not think the 25 per cent tariffs would happen on Saturday, but on Friday said the government was planning for different scenarios.\n\n\u201cWe have a plan A, plan B and a plan C, whatever the United States government decides,\u201d she said on Friday morning.\n\nDan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said a tariff war would be a huge concern for small Canadian businesses as more than half their members import goods from the US.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s new best friend is Elon and targeting these type of people close to the president might add pressure but, overall we are urging caution with retaliatory measures,\u201d he said.\n\nTiff Macklem, governor of the Bank of Canada, on Wednesday said US tariffs would likely put Canada in a recession and also raise consumer prices in

responses to Chinese start-up DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthrough.The meeting between Trump and Huang was to include discussion of AI policy, according to a person familiar with the discussion. On his first day in office, Trump revoked a Biden administration executive order focused on AI safety and has generally been seen by tech executives as accelerating America\u2019s advances in the fast-moving technology.Two people familiar with the meeting said it had been planned before DeepSeek stunned Silicon Valley with AI advances apparently achieved using far less computing power than US tech groups. The news wiped almost $600bn from the value of Nvidia, one of the biggest winners from spending on AI chips, on Monday. Neither the White House nor Nvidia disclosed details of the conversation afterwards, or whether specific agreements were made as a result of it. Speaking with reporters on Friday afternoon in the Oval Office, Trump called Huang a \u201cgreat gentleman\u201d and added the US would eventually put tariffs on computer chips. It was not clear if the chip tariffs were part of the discussion with Huang. Tariffs on chips and \u201cthings associated with chips\u201d were part of a sweeping plan announced by Trump on Friday for new restrictions on imports from the US\u2019s biggest trading partners.\u201cWe appreciated the opportunity to meet with President Trump and discuss semiconductors and AI policy,\u201d Nvidia said. \u201cJensen and the president discussed the importance of strengthening US technology and AI leadership.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s AI leap has sparked calls in Washington for the US government to tighten export controls further on AI-related technology to make it even harder for China to make advancements in the sector.\n\nOn Saturday, Singapore\u2019s government hit back at suggestions that DeepSeek could have acquired its AI chips from Nvidia\u2019s subsidiary in the city state, as a way of avoiding US export controls.\n\nUS authorities were reported to be investigating how DeepSeek accumulated the chips and were focusing on Singapore, which accounts for more than a fifth of Nvidia\u2019s revenues.\n\n\u201cWe expect US companies, like Nvidia, to comply with US export controls and our domestic legislation,\u201d Singapore\u2019s government said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur customs and law enforcement agencies will continue to work closely with their US counterparts.\u201d\n\nLast Monday, the same day DeepSeek released its latest model, Trump issued an executive order telling the state department and commerce department to review the US export control system \u201cin light of developments involving strategic adversaries\u201d.\n\nNvidia has long protested the expansion of US export controls that limit sales to China of its most powerful processors for AI. The Silicon Valley-based chipmaker has argued that constraining Chinese companies\u2019 access to American technology would only fuel China\u2019s innovation and development of its own local semiconductor industry.\n\nDeepSeek said its breakthrough AI model was created using a fraction of the computing resources of US rivals such as OpenAI or Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, which are assembling clusters of hundreds of thousands of chips. The final training run for its V3 model cost $5.6mn using just over 2,000 Nvidia chips, DeepSeek said in a research paper, although that figure excluded prior development costs.\n\nAnalysts at SemiAnalysis, a chip consultancy, have estimated that DeepSeek and its sister company, hedge fund High-Flyer, have access to about 60,000 Nvidia graphics processing units and have spent more than $500mn on chips to date.\n\nNvidia, which was the most valuable US company until Monday\u2019s stock market panic, was co-founded by Huang more than 30 years ago, turning the Taiwan-born businessman into one of America\u2019s richest people. He is now one of Silicon Valley\u2019s longest-serving CEOs.\n\nIn a letter to Mike Waltz, the new US national security adviser, the Republican chair and top Democrat on the House China committee, said the DeepSeek advance underscored the need for \u201cfrequently updating export controls\u201d. Josh Hawley, a Republican senator, has also introduced legislation that would prohibit the export to China of AI technology.\n\nAs the Biden administration tightened controls on what US chipmakers could sell in China since October 2022, Nvidia has continued to sell adapted versions of its AI chips there, alongside GPUs for the country\u2019s burgeoning PC gaming market. Customers with billing addresses in China, including Hong Kong, accounted for $11.6bn in revenues in the nine months ending in October, according to Nvidia\u2019s latest results.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/65e9c766-9ff7-4ff8-bff1-2c1c05c9d802"}}, {"id": "9ef1f0c2-171a-481b-b11c-491fcb3cc568", "event_name": "Venezuela releases US prisoners and agrees to take deportees", "blurb": "Agreement struck in meeting between Trump\u2019s envoy and country\u2019s authoritarian leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ", "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Donald Trump\u2019s crisis negotiator returned from Venezuela with six freed American prisoners after securing a commitment from the South American country\u2019s authoritarian leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to accept deported migrants.\n\nRichard Grenell, the US president\u2019s envoy for special missions, travelled to Venezuela on Friday to press Maduro to accept thousands of Venezuelan deportees, according to US officials, and to secure the release of US nationals taken prisoner by Caracas.\n\nDonald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Saturday: \u201cIt is so good to have the Venezuela Hostages back home and, very important to note, that Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their Country, all Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the U.S\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u201d\n\nThe Venezuelan government said in a statement that the talks were \u201crespectful\u201d and touched on migration, sanctions and detained US citizens, and that a \u201cfresh start\u201d was needed in relations between Washington and Caracas.

Russia, one of Maduro\u2019s backers, sent a government plane to Caracas that landed 15 minutes before Grenell\u2019s arrival on Friday.\n\nMaduro, a close ally of Russia and Iran, has been shunned by the west and much of Latin America after claiming victory in a presidential election last July whose result was widely regarded as fraudulent. The administration of former US President Joe Biden and the European parliament recognised the main opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as president-elect.\n\nResponding to a reporter on Friday while signing an executive order at the White House, Trump said Grenell\u2019s visit did not grant legitimacy to Maduro\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cWe want to do something with Venezuela. I\u2019ve been a very big opponent of Venezuela and Maduro,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve treated us not so good, but they\u2019ve treated, more importantly, the Venezuelan people, very badly.\u201d\n\nGrenell said in a post on X on January 20 that \u201cdiplomacy is back\u201d, saying he had held \u201cmultiple conversations with Venezuelan officials\u201d and that \u201ctalking is a tactic\u201d. He held a private meeting with Maduro\u2019s top political operator Jorge Rodr\u00edguez in Mexico in 2020 in the final days of the first Trump administration.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez this week urged Trump not to cut a deal with Maduro, and the Venezuelan opposition has been alarmed by meetings it held with him before Grenell travelled to Caracas.\n\n\u201cGrenell\u2019s nonchalance and lack of concern for democracy and human rights has left everyone very concerned,\u201d said an opposition figure who did not want to be named. The opposition fears that business interests will lobby Trump to cut a deal giving the US more access to Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves, the world\u2019s biggest.\n\nTrump\u2019s own position on Venezuela is unclear. He has said little about the country during the election campaign or since taking office, beyond accusing Maduro of ruining the country and saying on January 20 that \u201cwe don\u2019t have to buy their oil\u201d \u2014 remarks interpreted by some as a negotiating tactic to put pressure on Maduro. Ahead of Maduro\u2019s swearing-in, Trump referred to Gonz\u00e1lez as \u201cpresident-elect\u201d and the opposition as \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d.\n\nA former official who worked in Trump\u2019s first administration said the US president was mainly concerned about migration. \u201cHe\u2019s just revoked temporary protected status for 600,000 Venezuelan [migrants] in the US and there are easily twice that number there illegally,\u201d the former official said. \u201cTrump has got to get rid of them all from the US.\u201d\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d sanctions on Maduro\u2019s government and recognised then-opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president. But the strategy failed to dislodge Maduro, who remained in power with the help of Russia, China and Iran, while Guaid\u00f3 eventually fled to Florida.\n\n\u201cTrump regards the opposition as losers,\u201d the former official said. \u201cHe gave them a lot and they failed. There is no way he is going back down that road again.\u201d", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a8064a2f-140d-4a66-9459-4c1df5da0026"}}, {"id": "9485277d-fc4c-4225-b9e7-919dc55f8638", "event_name": "Is Wall Street ready to stay up all night?", "blurb": "The New York Stock Exchange is looking to trade for 22 hours a day \u2014\u00a0raising thorny questions about how equity markets function", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "On Sunday night in Chicago, Steve Quirk by habit checked the S&P 500 futures prices and noted a large fall. The following day, the markets veteran was looking at figures showing a surge in overnight trading on online broker Robinhood as investor darling Nvidia slumped amid worries about Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek.\n\nNvidia\u2019s travails produced the second-biggest late-night trading session for Robinhood, best known for popularising smartphone-based trading. It has offered overnight dealing for the past 18 months and Monday ranked for volume behind only the night of the US presidential election in November.\n\n\u201cOur users don\u2019t trade overnight once and go away,\u201d says Quirk, Robinhood\u2019s chief brokerage officer. \u201cThey look for an opportunity to do so again.\u201d\n\nRobinhood\u2019s activity boom in the small hours is only the latest example of the growing interest in overnight trading \u2014 a trend fuelled by the availability of sophisticated trading apps on phones, and an increasingly knowledgeable base of small retail investors as comfortable trading Amazon from their sofas as they are shopping on it.\n\nMany of these night owls developed a taste for trading during pandemic lockdowns, and a return to the office has pushed their investing habits outside of business hours. The overnight session \u2014 8pm to 4am in New York \u2014 often sees them trading with Asia\u2019s famously active household investors, who relish the chance to trade big US names in their daytime.\n\nAlthough retail trading is big business in the US, where more than half of all households hold stocks directly, developments in mom-and-pop trading habits would normally mean little to the vastly bigger professional world of asset managers and Wall Street brokers.\n\nBut that is changing because of the growing interest in overnight trading from more established quarters. The New York Stock Exchange, the largest in the world, is one of a number of groups which are now looking to offer much longer trading windows.\n\nThis is pushing investment professionals to engage in surprisingly complex debates around the simplest-seeming questions.\n\nWhen, for example, does a trading day begin and end if it runs around the clock? What would be the closing price of a stock \u2014 typically the reference point for trillions of dollars in funds \u2014\u00a0if the day were seamless?\n\nThose are just a couple of the big questions about trading through the wee hours. Other worries include how portfolio managers deal with the risks of big moves in their holdings while they\u2019re asleep, and the cost and difficulty of maintaining complex systems with little or no downtime.\n\n\u201cTalk 24-hour and the joke is, \u2018I don\u2019t know when our operations guy is going to sleep.\u2019 That is an actual issue,\u201d says Tyler Gellasch, chief executive of investor advocate Healthy Markets Association. \u201cBut I feel like that\u2019s going to be the least of your worries when you wake up to a margin call on a big position.\u201d\n\nBy some measures, stocks are already late to the overnight party.\n\nThe dollar trades 24 hours a day on various platforms around the world and dealing in S&P 500 index futures, which signal the likely market direction ahead of the New York opening, is brisk from the Tokyo morning onwards. Cryptocurrency investors, meanwhile, have never known anything but a 24-7 digital world.\n\nFrom the earliest days of informal trading in lower Manhattan coffee houses, US stock markets have largely stuck to some form of a traditional business day, though precise hours have varied.\n\nEven the rising power of west coast investors and companies has not altered the official New York 4pm close of business. The last major changes to the US day were made some two decades ago, when exchanges began offering pre- and after-market sessions that now run from 4am Eastern to the open, and from the close to 8pm Eastern, respectively.\n\nTraders in Los Angeles and San Francisco, three hours behind New York, suck up 5am starts for the joy of beating the traffic as they head home soon after 1pm on days when there is little to generate activity after 4pm in New York.\n\nDaytime trading for stocks is also practical because it involves so many parties: a million-plus people are employed directly in the US securities industry, and there are the executives of the companies whose shares are being traded and the regulators who oversee it all.\n\nAdding to the complexity is the sheer scale of the $50tn market. Some 12bn shares are traded daily through millions of transactions. The counterparties include giant pension funds, high-speed traders dealing in milliseconds and individual investors trading a handful of shares. Every transaction must be agreed, with money and shares changing hands the next day. On top of all this is a web of intricate rules designed to ensure fair dealing.\n\nBetween 8pm and 4am in New York, overnight trading, including on Robinhood, is now mostly conducted through Blue Ocean, a so-called alternative trading system that launched in 2021 specifically to offer overnight access. Members of these alternative systems \u2014 also known as \u201cdark pools\u201d \u2014 trade among themselves at prices that are not made public.\n\nWhile Blue Ocean\u2019s volumes, about 40mn shares a night, are a tiny fraction of what the likes of the NYSE do on any regular day, it has steadily built a market linking American night owls with Asian day traders. Now two exchanges are eyeing its turf.\n\nIn November, the Securities and Exchange Commission tentatively approved 24 Exchange, or 24X, a Bermuda-based group backed by hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 Ventures fund with plans to trade nearly all day long. Until recently, its main business had been currency trading. Once some key regulatory infrastructure is in place, it plans to open 23 hours a day with an hour for brokers to update their systems. Its approval makes it the first US exchange with an avowed goal of dealing overnight, although under industry pushback it shrank original plans that included weekend trading.\n\nNYSE too, may soon join the sleepless fray. The SEC is yet to weigh in on its separate plan, put forward by the exchange a month earlier, that would see it extend its trading day from the current 4am-8pm to a much lengthier 1.30am-11.30pm.\n\nThe involvement of exchanges matters for the rest of the market because they are more tightly supervised than dark pools and are responsible for continuously publishing their best bid (buy) and offer (sell) prices through their trading day. These flow through a service known colloquially as the \u201ctape\u201d, against which any investor can compare the price they got from their broker, who has an obligation to execute trades at the best price.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing from multiple types of market participants for about two years now that they think there is demand and opportunity to extend hours further,\u201d says Kevin Tyrrell, head of markets at NYSE.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also had global investors looking to the US more and more \u2014 for trading and investing and also large companies transferring their listings from other regions into the US. So it seems very natural for us to be having these conversations.\u201d\n\nBig industry reservations remain, however, from managing risk to having to operate all night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a solo game. Traders are always asking an analyst or a fund manager, \u2018Hey, does this new price point mean something?\u2019\u201d says one senior dealer at a large global investor. \u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest fear for folks, is that they end up on call 24 hours.\u201d\n\nIn June 2024, Justin Schack, a partner at Wall Street broker Rosenblatt Securities, appeared before a House committee looking into the US market set-up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that no one with a blank slate would design such a complex system to achieve such a simple task,\u201d Schack, who heads Rosenblatt\u2019s market structure team, told the politicians when describing the current system.\n\nOther Wall Street brokers agree. Ask them about the issues that 24-hour advocates must address and they list thorny ones: clearing or guaranteeing trades, building out technology and staffing, running the \u201ctape\u201d to cover longer hours and ensuring all their systems can cope.\n\nTraders have their concerns too, from how much stocks can move to whether regulators might factor overnight prices into how they apply daytime rules.\n\n\u201cWhat are the rules for overnight trading? If you did have a big price dislocation, where does the stock stop? Without clarity around specific items, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get institutional buy-in,\u201d says Mehmet Kinak, global head of equity trading at T Rowe Price, in a reference to the so-called circuit breakers operating in daylight hours, which temporarily halt a stock that moves particularly sharply.\n\nKinak adds that thin liquidity during extended hours makes it an unattractive time for big players to trade US stocks. \u201cWhat if a stock is indicated up 3 per cent and we happen to be a seller? By the time we are done executing an order for 200,000 shares, I\u2019m not going to get a price anywhere near up 3 per cent, there\u2019s just no depth or broad market participation.\u201d\n\nTo guard against wild swings that can catch investors out, overnight trades currently operate under a limit order system, meaning investors cannot simply send buy or sell instructions, but must set the price at which they will trade. If no one takes that price, the order expires unfilled in the morning.\n\nThe global head of trading for a west coast asset manager agrees with Kinak that overnight offers limited trading opportunities for big investors, but cautions that not trading might not remove the dangers.\n\n\u201cThe real questions, then, are about what we would have to consider in those hours for our oversight and technology,\u201d he says. \u201cCould a regulator come in and ask me about best execution, and point to prices overnight that I\u2019m not capturing as part of my process? That could create an obligation to staff markets 24 hours. That\u2019s a big burden to put on the entire industry.\u201d\n\nWhen the day starts and ends matters to investors everywhere too. Few in the industry want to change the official 4pm close \u2014 by far the busiest trading point in the current day because it is used to set the daily reference prices for traded securities, from which the $30tn-plus held in mutual and exchange traded funds take their value.\n\nAfter the close, an entire system of clearing and settlement also kicks in, ensuring that sellers receive their payment and buyers have their new holdings re-registered under their name.\n\nAdditionally, it is when systems are adjusted for changes to shares, such as a company altering the number of shares trading or announcing a dividend payment date. These adjustments move share prices and brokers bear the cost if they miss one: in 2023 Robinhood took a $57mn hit when its systems failed to register a company that shrunk its share count.\n\n24X plans a one-hour downtime at 7pm, while NYSE is suggesting two hours, not starting until 11.30pm. Those schedules raise some eyebrows.\n\n\u201cHow are brokers going to test their systems? In the wee hours? We\u2019d potentially be making thousands of market participants adjust to being able to work in the middle of the night and also work very quickly,\u201d says Healthy Markets\u2019 Gellasch.\n\nMost of the questions industry insiders are asking do not yet have definitive answers.\n\nThey can seem outsized too, given that more than 80 per cent of trading today, despite the pre- and post-market sessions, is still done within the regular New York market hours of 9.30am to 4pm \u2014\u00a0and no one expects an imminent, sustained boom in back-of-the-clock dealing.\n\nBut the discussions keep growing. The merits, or otherwise, of 24-hour trading often produce the liveliest debates at industry conferences around the US. They veer between a sense of inevitability and questioning the need for an overnight session at all. Privately, many traders are worried about the knock-on effect on their personal lives if trading hours get longer.\n\nThose already trading overnight are busy building ties with Asian brokers. Blue Ocean is opening a second Asia office in South Korea less than a year after its first in Tokyo. And on a trip this month to the region, 24X executives said they were overwhelmed with meeting requests.\n\n\u201cAsian retail investors have a very aggressive investing style and they want to trade Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla in their daytime and we\u2019re going to be well positioned to capture that,\u201d says Dmitri Galinov, chief executive of 24X. \u201cAs volumes rise, institutions will come in.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, more big US names are being drawn to trading out of hours. In November, Charles Schwab, the largest US broker, boasting $10tn in client assets, began offering overnight trading in more than 500 stocks and ETFs to its most active trader clients, up from 24 ETFs previously.\n\n\u201cOvernight trading has developed to the point we felt we could expand our offer,\u201d says James Kostulias, head of trading services at Charles Schwab. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new discussion by any means but it is now a reality.\u201d", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f711e768-5655-4c98-93bc-c83a8eab6c20"}}, {"id": "02d3ea5d-5412-4fbd-85cb-19a59c0d8c02", "event_name": "Former national security adviser Jake Sullivan: \u2018The core engines of American power are humming\u2019", "blurb": "The Biden administration official on leaving Trump with a \u2018strong hand\u2019, export controls on AI chips \u2014 and why war with China is not inevitable \u00a0", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "When Jake Sullivan enters the private room at Rasika West End, I joke with the former US national security adviser that I would have dressed down had I known he would be casual. \u201cSmart casual,\u201d he corrects me with a smile.\n\nSullivan has picked a modern Indian restaurant just blocks from where he has lived in Washington for the past four years with his wife Maggie Goodlander, the newly elected congresswoman from New Hampshire. \u201cThis was kind of a date place,\u201d he says, making me feel slightly like an imposter.\n\nJudging by the lack of commotion, you would not realise my guest had just spent four years at the heart of the White House, dealing with a Chinese spy balloon, nuclear threats from Russian president Vladimir Putin and conflicts across the Middle East. The 48-year-old was also the lead architect of what he described as a \u201cnew Washington consensus\u201d that fused economic and national security policies, driven by his view that America needed a \u201cforeign policy for the middle class\u201d.\n\nBefore we pivot to more serious issues, I have a sensitive question. Who is more Irish, Jake Sullivan or Joe Biden?\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going on number of times asserting Irishness in life, Joe Biden beats me,\u201d he says playfully, before noting that Biden, who generally only touts his Irish background, also has French and English roots. \u201cI am mostly, if not entirely, Irish,\u201d he continues, before delivering the killer blow: \u201c[The name] Biden, I think, is English.\u201d\n\nOur waitress is hovering. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna get the chicken tikka masala,\u201d he says. I order tandoori duck makani.\n\nThe wallpaper in the room depicts monkeys smoking cigars and drinking vodka, which makes his pitch for sparkling water disappointing. I twist his arm \u2014 with minimal effort. \u201cDay drinking,\u201d he laughs, and orders an Italian Valpolicella Ripasso.\n\nI want to ask about November 5, when Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump but Sullivan\u2019s wife was elected to Congress. How did he feel about losing the White House? \u201cHonestly, that night, it didn\u2019t fully sink in. I was so excited for Maggie,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a wonderful night, and then a harder morning.\u201d\n\nMonths earlier, there was another difficult moment when Biden had a catastrophic debate against Trump. Was Sullivan, a former university champion debater, surprised, or had there been signs that Biden was slipping? \u201cI had not seen that coming, flat out had not seen it,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought it was going to be a seismic event in the campaign.\u201d\n\nCritics argue that Biden\u2019s closest aides must have realised that he was slowing mentally. But Sullivan insists that he was taken by complete surprise. \u201cIt was not at all consistent with my experience.\u201d\n\nAs our wine arrives, I ask if he has started to think about why the Democrats lost the White House. \u201cI\u2019ve started to, but not nearly as much as I did in 2016. On November 9 2016, I was unemployed on my couch and could just sit and think about it indefinitely,\u201d he says.\n\nHe thinks the outcome of the 2016 election was \u201cdeeply structural\u201d and marked a \u201cdelayed reckoning of the 2008 financial crisis and a deep wellspring of anger among the American people that the system had failed them\u201d.\u00a0\u201c[2024] may just be one of those elections where you have a Democrat running against a Republican at a time of high prices and anti-incumbent global sentiment and the Republican narrowly beat the Democrat and it\u2019s not really about something existential,\u201d he says. \u201cOr maybe it will bear out that it\u2019s something more existential.\u201d\n\nSwitching to his time in the White House, I ask what he regards as his biggest accomplishment. He says he is proud to have helped create a situation where the \u201ccore engines of American power are humming\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur alliances are stronger than they\u2019ve been in a very long time. Our competitors and adversaries are weaker too in ways that have defied expectations, certainly with China. And we\u2019ve produced that very strong American hand without getting entangled in war overseas,\u201d he argues.\n\nHe continues by saying that the domestic investment in chips and export controls on AI-related chips, coupled with efforts to boost the defence industrial base and diversify supply chains, marked a new approach to policy. But he stresses that it is a \u201cgenerational project\u201d that he hopes the Trump administration will adopt and build on.\n\nChina policy, he adds, was another achievement. \u201cAmerica is in a demonstrably better position in the long-term competition with China than we were, and yet we did it while stabilising the relationship and finding areas to work together.\u201d\n\nHe says the US and China are in a \u201cdecisive decade\u201d that will determine which comes out ahead in key areas such as artificial intelligence and the transition to a clean energy economy. \u201cFour out of those 10 years in the decisive decade\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[have] turned in America\u2019s favour in a really significant way,\u201d says Sullivan, adding that the export controls the US imposed on high-end chips and manufacturing equipment have had a \u201cdemonstrable impact\u201d.\n\nDays after our lunch, a Chinese company called DeepSeek stunned Silicon Valley by unveiling an AI model that appears to rival US models. After the news broke, I emailed Sullivan to get his reaction. He says it shows that the US needs to \u201cstay on our game\u201d but he is \u201cstill confident in the American lead\u201d in AI. He stresses that it \u201conly reinforces\u201d his view on the importance of export controls.\n\nAnother critical area in the decisive decade is US deterrence in the face of what Sullivan describes as the \u201clargest peacetime military build-up in human history\u201d being undertaken by China. The US boosted deterrence by bolstering its alliances and urging allies to work more closely with each other, Sullivan says. He adds that Aukus \u2014 the US-UK-Australia agreement to enable Canberra to procure nuclear-powered submarines \u2014 was a \u201chuge deal\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strategic marriage between the United States and Australia for half a century,\u201d he says.\n\nAs our dishes arrive, Sullivan says his biggest regret is how the US handled its withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, which led to the deaths of 13 members of the American military. He says the administration had decided that pulling out too rapidly could destroy morale in Kabul and lead to the collapse of the Afghan government \u2014 but it ended up falling anyway.\n\n\u201cA lesson learned from that is, if there are risks associated with an evacuation, just move out early, even if it comes with some friction with the host government,\u201d says Sullivan.\n\nOver four years, he dealt with multiple crises involving China, including its 2021 hypersonic missile test, its huge military exercises in response to then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s trip to Taiwan in 2022, and the Chinese spy balloon that flew over the US in 2023. Which stands out in his mind?\n\nHe cites the spy balloon saga, which followed the \u201cextreme tensions\u201d sparked by Pelosi\u2019s Taiwan visit. \u201cIt felt like we were in a very deep hole, but something more than that. It felt like, in living colour, the risk of a downward spiral in the US-China relationship was not merely abstract. This could go bad.\u201d\n\nI am still puzzled as to whether China intentionally flew the balloon over the US, or if it was blown off course by weather. He says it is hard to say without veering into classified areas, but drops a hint. \u201cYou can find Biden comments publicly\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009where his personal opinion was that this was not intentional,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll say.\u201d\n\nA more recent espionage case is a months-long Chinese hacking attack against US telecoms networks called \u201cSalt Typhoon\u201d. \u201cWhat makes Salt Typhoon unique is the sheer scale of access,\u201d he says about the ongoing attack. \u201cThey weren\u2019t just going into a senior government official\u2019s phone. They were going into the major American telecommunications companies, Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, and picking any phone they wanted to listen to.\u201d\n\nSullivan says a critical question is whether US telecoms companies remain \u201chighly vulnerable\u201d to hacking from China. \u201cI would say right now, today, they are,\u201d he warns.\n\nI suddenly realise I have been attacking the plain naan that Sullivan ordered and not my garlic naan. But we are focused more on the conversation than our curries, so I hope he has not noticed.\n\nI want to return to the critical issue of Taiwan. Was there ever a time when he worried that Washington and Beijing were heading towards some kind of military conflict?\n\n\u201cBeijing began to develop a perception that the direction of American policy on Taiwan was inexorably toward the end of the status quo,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIf Beijing became convinced there\u2019s only one way to stop Taiwan independence, and it\u2019s grab Taiwan or bomb Taiwan, they would do it,\u201d he warns.\n\nAs a result, it was critical to send a \u201cvery clear message of deterrence\u201d while making clear at the same time that Washington was not trying to upend the status quo.\n\n\u201cThe US and China have kept this delicate balance for decades,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just need to practise a disciplined approach that sustains that out into the future. If we do\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we can sustain it. I do not believe war is inevitable.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Biden made a big bet on India by deepening technology and security co-operation. As Sullivan touts their achievements \u2014 starting with how Biden elevated the Quad grouping of the US, India, Japan and Australia \u2014 our waitress removes his plate. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done very much damage,\u201d I quip. \u201cI\u2019m a light eater,\u201d he says.\n\nThe goal of closer ties with India, I suggest, was not helped by the assassination of a Sikh separatist in Vancouver and a thwarted assassination plot in New York, both suspected of having links to Indian intelligence. Under pressure from the US, New Delhi launched an investigation that remains open after more than a year. Sullivan says it is important to get answers. \u201cI hope the Trump administration will keep pressing.\u201d\n\nI ask how he evaluates the situation in Ukraine. \u201cThe question is, can the current administration display sufficient staying power that Putin sees we\u2019re going to hang in there and the costs are going to continue to mount?\u201d he says. \u201cIn which case, I do believe there\u2019s a deal to be done.\u201d\n\nJust before our lunch, Trump had threatened to hit Russia with more tariffs and sanctions if there was no agreement to end the war, which Sullivan says was a \u201cgood\u201d move.\n\nBiden came under criticism for not providing certain weapons systems, including F-16 fighter jets, as quickly as requested by Kyiv. Sullivan pushes back. Biden approved F-16 transfers in May 2023, but the Ukrainian air force has only 18 jets because, Sullivan explains, it has only 16 pilots trained to fly the sophisticated fighters.\n\nAfter he orders mint tea and I ask for a coffee, Sullivan presses home his point. \u201cThe conventional wisdom that we did too little too late, and if only we had given this weapons system at this time rather than that time something would be dramatically different in the war, is not borne out by any serious review of the evidence,\u201d he says.\n\nWe move on to Iran. Sullivan thinks the regime in Tehran is weaker than at any time since the Iran-Iraq war, which ended in 1988. How does he expect Trump to handle the issue? \u201cI predict a robust debate in this administration between an audacious diplomatic play and an audacious military play,\u201d he responds, prompting me to ask whether he thinks Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be tempted to launch a military strike.\n\n\u201cWithout personalising it to Netanyahu, I would say the senior leadership of Israel, both political and military as well as intelligence, will be sorely tempted to take advantage of this moment.\u201d\n\nI ask about Gaza and whether he believes the Biden administration had the right balance amid criticism that it did not put enough pressure on Netanyahu to stop the killing of civilians.\n\n\u201cThere was immense human suffering in Gaza, and so for me to sit here and say, \u2018No, no, it all went great,\u2019 would display a total lack of human empathy. On the other hand, the idea of cutting weapons off from Israel when they were taking incoming from several fronts all at once\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I\u2019m not sure how I could have justified that. So, it\u2019s hard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the single biggest thing in the four years where only some level of perspective gained over time will allow me to fully judge what I thought we did right and what I thought we didn\u2019t do right.\u201d\n\nWe have been talking for well over two hours. Putting policy questions aside, I want to learn more about the man before our time is up.\n\nAfter four intense years with less than two weeks of vacation, Sullivan\u2019s immediate plans do not involve work. He is flying to Utah to go skiing with friends the next day and is planning a guys\u2019 hiking trip to the Grand Canyon and Horseshoe Bend in Arizona.\n\nHe is also looking forward to reading books after having almost no time in the White House beyond a little \u201cescapist\u201d reading. He played soccer in high school and raves about The Club by Jonathan Clegg and Joshua Robinson, about the Premier League. His interest in English football stems from his time at Oxford university, when he started following Chelsea.\n\nSo, what is next, I ask?

Perhaps more curious still, a similar phenomenon in the UK is instead giving Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves a headache.\n\nIn both cases, the narrative is being shaped by how labour market statistics deal with the revelation that the population is larger than was previously realised. But this plays out in different ways on the two sides of the Atlantic.\n\nLast quarter, Britain\u2019s Office for National Statistics revised upward its estimates of net immigration during the two years ending in December 2023, calculating that around 300,000 more people than initially thought arrived and stayed in the UK, a 20 per cent bump. This increase, as well as some of the updated assumptions beneath the surface, fed into revised population projections published earlier this week.\n\nIf that sounds like a big adjustment, the US Census Bureau then increased its estimates of net immigration for 2022 and 2023 by almost 90 per cent, from 2.1mn to 4mn, adding another 2.8mn for 2024. As a result, US population growth last year is now thought to have been the fastest in decades.\n\nTo be clear: the fact that these revisions happen is a good thing. In both cases, the way immigration is counted is improving, aided in large part by the incorporation of administrative data, which is more accurate and timely than survey-based sources. At any rate, it\u2019s far better to have revisions and more accurate numbers, than no revisions and still the wrong numbers.\n\nBut substantial shifts like these don\u2019t just change what we thought we knew about population size and growth rates. They influence economic indicators too, not least labour market statistics.\n\nNext Friday\u2019s monthly US jobs report, the first of Trump\u2019s second term, will incorporate a raft of revisions to the underlying survey data, among them the dramatic upward adjustment to the population size.\n\nAnalyses from the Brookings Institution and Jed Kolko, formerly a senior economist under Joe Biden, indicate that, contrary to reports last year, the new figures will probably show that native-born Americans are not losing out in the job market relative to immigrants. In fact, US-born employment is growing.\n\nThe old, erroneously low population figures artificially lowered estimated employment levels derived from America\u2019s main household economic survey, causing US-born employment to appear to be falling. In reality, population growth was so high that even though the native-born share had fallen, the native-born number still rose.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, similar revisions have a very different impact. Well-publicised problems with Britain\u2019s labour force survey mean the UK increasingly leans on administrative data to take the temperature of the labour market. And that shows that the number of working-age payrolled employees flatlined for most of last year, before dipping.\n\nCrucially, because these figures are counts based on tax records, not proportions derived from surveys, unexpectedly high population numbers only grow the denominator in the employment rate, not both sides of the equation as in the US. As a result, stagnant UK job numbers translate into a marked deterioration in labour market conditions when viewed against the backdrop of robust immigration-driven population growth.\n\nThe number of working-age UK employees is down 0.2 percentage points year-on-year, but expressed as a proportion of the population the dip is almost a full percentage point \u2014 the deepest since 2008, pandemic aside. Where the rapid labour market loosening of 2008 was mainly driven by a shrinking numerator (job losses), this one comes primarily from an expanding denominator (possibly inflated by jobless arrivals).\n\nThe depth of this downturn is probably a lower bound, since some recent arrivals may be self-employed or in other types of employment that the UK\u2019s tax-based job figures struggle to capture. But the general picture of population growth outpacing job growth is clear.\n\nWhile statistics like the numbers of people and workers in the country might feel solid, the array of revisions and methodological differences highlight the flimsy nature of many narratives that form around them. The picture gets more accurate over time, but there will be blurry moments along the way.\n\njohn.burn-murdoch@ft.com, @jburnmurdoch", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/522d896b-d949-4676-a15c-0d4bff215062"}}, {"id": "d2281688-8ca6-49c3-8cd1-8f0c52b78e47", "event_name": "Trump has made a good start", "blurb": "A series of early moves has breathed fresh life into the business community", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute\n\nWall Street\u2019s confidence in US technological leadership was shaken this week with the unveiling of DeepSeek\u2019s latest artificial intelligence model. The Chinese start-up seemed to come out of nowhere.\n\nThis episode should highlight the wisdom of President Donald Trump\u2019s approach to AI. His executive order on the technology is admirably clear: \u201cIt is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America\u2019s global AI dominance.\u201d\u00a0He revoked the policies of the Biden administration, which were \u201cto advance and govern the development and use of AI\u201d in accordance with several goals, including \u201cadvancing equity\u201d and ensuring that AI does not \u201cworsen job quality\u201d or cause \u201charmful labour-force disruptions\u201d.\n\nI am glad to have a president who prioritises AI\u2019s importance to economic prosperity and national security. And this is not the only good move by Trump among the blitz of activity since his inauguration.\n\nHis efforts to deregulate the energy sector and to expand geothermal and nuclear energy production are similarly laudable. They will increase the reliability of electricity supply and reduce energy costs for households and businesses. The new president has already reversed Biden\u2019s foolish pause on new export permits for liquefied natural gas.\n\nMeanwhile, ending Lina Khan\u2019s reign as head of the nation\u2019s antitrust enforcement agency has breathed new life into the business community.\n\nAll this is unleashing animal spirits \u2014 and not just among top bankers and chief executives. Sentiment is surging on Main Street as well.\u00a0In December, the National Federation of Independent Businesses\u2019 small business survey recorded the largest monthly increase since 1983 in the net percentage of companies expecting the economy to improve. This positive sentiment could translate into expansion, innovation and investment, quickening productivity growth and increasing wages.\n\nElsewhere, the new Department of Government Efficiency should be applauded for attempting to increase the efficiency of the federal government.\u00a0Ronald Reagan remarked that \u201ca government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we\u2019ll ever see on this earth\u201d. He made that observation in 1964. Since then, federal government spending as a share of annual GDP has grown by more than 30 per cent. If Doge is able to work with Congress to prove Reagan wrong, all the better.\n\nPublic sector employees hold positions of public trust, and some of Trump\u2019s efforts to hold government workers to higher performance standards are to be welcomed. For example, the vast majority of them should be expected to go to work in their offices five days per week, where they will be most productive and able to generate the highest return on taxpayers\u2019 dollars.\n\nTrump has a different approach on tax, too. The Biden administration wanted to sign up to an international corporate tax cartel, known as Pillar Two, in order to keep other nations from reducing business taxes. Trump wants to further reduce corporate taxes in the US. I\u2019m with him.\n\nThe president was also right to halt the disbursement of $300bn in green energy funding. It would be better to use those funds to finance business tax cuts like full expensing, which would increase investment, productivity and wages.\n\nTrump has been president for less than two weeks, and the ultimate success or failure of all of these initiatives will depend on their specific design, implementation and execution.\u00a0This is especially true of immigration. Deporting, say, 200,000 illegal immigrants this year who have committed serious crimes would be good for the nation. But attempting to deport, say, 2mn illegal immigrants in 2025 would hurt workers, businesses and communities.\n\nSimilarly, if done properly, efforts to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion schemes could increase focus on merit and reduce racial discrimination in the job market. But they could also exacerbate discrimination if handled poorly.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty about the new administration to criticise, to be sure. For example, Trump\u2019s decision to pardon violent January 6 insurrectionists was appalling. On economics, among other examples, his threats to increase tariffs on America\u2019s allies could reduce business investment and weaken international alliances. And he is likely to continue to refuse to cut Medicare and social security spending, which is driving the nation\u2019s unsustainable fiscal trajectory.\n\nBut the president\u2019s critics won\u2019t do themselves any favours by not being open to the good things his administration will do \u2014 and has already done.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/16ab6569-1719-4b1a-8efb-0790b9f93948"}}, {"id": "9e6d0b8d-cc17-4dc9-9def-05260423fcaa", "event_name": "The threat to Aids sufferers shows how far the Republicans have fallen", "blurb": "An African aid programme created by George W Bush is casually being endangered by Donald Trump", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "Ten days into the Trump administration, it\u2019s hard to say which is worse \u2014 the targeted spreading of fear by raids on immigrant workers and native Americans or the wanton destruction caused by the casual suspension of foreign aid. Earlier this week, secretary of state Marco Rubio had to rush to issue an emergency temporary reprieve to the 20mn people, including half a million children, currently being kept alive by antiretroviral drugs under the US Pepfar (President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief) programme, principally in Africa. The edict suspending foreign aid had reportedly already caused some Aids sufferers to be denied drugs, and Pepfar\u2019s future remains uncertain.\n\nPepfar has helped turn a pandemic engulfing much of the continent into just another public health problem to be managed. It\u2019s striking that its creator was George W Bush, like Trump a conservative president who otherwise diminished the US\u2019s reputation abroad and trashed its fiscal probity at home.\n\nThe standard view of acts such as cutting aid is that they are foolish even on the basis of hard-headed self-interest because they diminish the US\u2019s soft power abroad. That\u2019s possibly true, but Pepfar and the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), a separate aid programme set up around the same time by Bush, were not simply crude attempts to buy influence. They proved a genuine good-faith break with decades of cynical American aid that had kept foreign policy clients like Pakistan and Egypt in the US camp but did little to make lives there better off.\n\nAs a reporter then covering aid and development in Washington, it took me some time, amid the administration\u2019s dissembling over the Iraq war and much else, to realise that the Bush aid initiatives were for real. After a while it became obvious and even occasionally amusing that the US was earnestly inventing aid programmes as it went along. The MCA was triumphantly announced ahead of a UN development summit in Mexico in 2002 and then had to be \u201cclarified\u201d a few days later to reveal that the budget was twice as big as first claimed. The rather endearing story at the time was that the White House had simply misunderstood its own numbers.\n\nBush announced Pepfar in a State of the Union speech in 2003, saying it would replicate in other African countries the successful Ugandan model of administering antiretrovirals (ARVs) through a network of medical centre hubs with satellite distribution units. Leaving aside the irony of the Bush administration encouraging a socialist model of centralised public healthcare, the plan again had to be somewhat changed \u2014 one of the main architects being the immunologist Anthony Fauci of Covid pandemic fame \u2014 after it turned out most recipient countries didn\u2019t actually have Uganda\u2019s institutional set-up.\n\nBut Pepfar not only worked, it also challenged development orthodoxy. Rather than painstakingly building systems of public finance and healthcare, it hurled money at a specific problem and got results. It was widely believed mass ARV therapy would not be possible. Pepfar showed it was. The US also overcame its intrinsic suspicion of multilateral initiatives and led the financing of a new \u201cGlobal Fund\u201d to combat Aids, tuberculosis and malaria set up in 2002. Credible estimates are that Pepfar has saved 26mn lives.\n\nThe lobbying that overcame the traditional visceral US resistance to foreign aid also managed to unearth hitherto unsuspected reserves of compassion on Capitol Hill, often linked to religiosity. At the time, I spoke to Republican lawmakers who seemed to have only the sketchiest idea about how development aid worked but had received visits from the rock star Bono, trusted him and were accordingly prepared to spend taxpayers\u2019 money to help Africa.\n\nRemarkably, Bono persuaded North Carolina senator Jesse Helms, the hardline conservative Republican who used to talk about aid going down foreign \u201cratholes\u201d, to fund debt relief and HIV-Aids treatment in developing countries. Helms was won over in particular by the plight of babies born with HIV who were indisputably innocent victims. The general tactic of seeding every development campaign with an emoting celebrity has become tedious, but this was impressive work.\n\nBut the aid programmes weren\u2019t part of a general internationalist mindset. The Republican isolationist tradition remained strong \u2014 and was exploited by Trump with regard to Bush\u2019s Iraq war during campaigning for the presidential nomination in 2016. In fact, Bush himself allowed Iraq to slide into chaos after the disastrous invasion. He was fundamentally not a nation-builder.\n\nThe global Doha round of trade talks in effect collapsed during Bush\u2019s administration, as the US (along with other countries) was not prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to get it to work. Despite Pepfar, US relative influence in Africa continued to diminish, as it had since the end of the cold war. The 2000s was the decade when the Chinese rather than the American footprint expanded over the continent.\n\nPepfar and the other aid programmes simply reflected a moment when campaigners managed to mine a vein of decency in a Republican administration and among lawmakers on Capitol Hill. The fact that it was threatened with casual destruction this week shows how far decency has leached from the White House. If it still exists among Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s hiding very effectively. The world has become darker for it.\n\nalan.beattie@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88b3b032-26b2-40a2-b892-89ab7fadfc01"}}, {"id": "992a54c3-bced-4f26-b5f4-1aa0eca990bc", "event_name": "The global AI race: Is China catching up to the US?", "blurb": "The release of DeepSeek\u2019s new model has shaken assumptions about who has the upper hand in developing the technology ", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "On Monday, the world watched as $1tn was wiped off the stock market in a single day, a huge bonfire kindled by the little-known Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek.\n\nIts release of a new AI model, known as R1, upended assumptions about US supremacy in AI and raised the prospect that some in China are learning how to beat Silicon Valley at its own game.\n\nThe model can \u201creason\u201d to solve complex scientific problems and performs at par with leading-edge software from US tech giants, but was apparently developed at a fraction of the price of those models.\n\nIt quickly dislodged OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the US iOS App store.\n\nAlongside the geopolitical challenge, DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough has dual implications for the tech industry. Firstly, it is likely to accelerate the commercial development and uptake of AI, much as ChatGPT did in 2022.\n\nAt the same time, it threatens to demolish investment assumptions that have underpinned the entire US stock market, by seeming to show that developing advanced AI models does not require vast amounts of infrastructure and thus capital.\n\nThe question being asked with sudden urgency from California to Wall Street: Has China caught up in AI at just the moment that many working in the field claim they are on the brink of a historic breakthrough that will put machines on a par with human-level intelligence \u2014 a threshold known as artificial general intelligence?\n\n\u201c[DeepSeek\u2019s] algorithmic innovations remind us that China and the US are neck and neck and that our technological edge isn\u2019t guaranteed, pushing our industry to make AI more efficient,\u201d says Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive and chair of Google.\n\n\u201cTo get to AGI first, we\u2019ll need to continue to invest in talent, support our vibrant open-source ecosystem, and ensure we out-innovate, not just outspend, our competitors.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek was founded on Silicon Valley-style levels of ambition. It started out in 2023 as a side project for the eccentric hedge fund billionaire Liang Wenfeng, just as the race to replicate ChatGPT was heating up. It has since turned into one of China\u2019s leading AI labs.\n\n\u201cWhy is Silicon Valley so innovative? Because they dare to do things,\u201d Liang said in an interview last year. \u201cWhen ChatGPT came out, the tech community in China lacked confidence in frontier innovation.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cFrom investors to [Chinese] big tech, they all thought that the gap was too big and opted to focus on applications instead. But innovation starts with confidence.\u201d\n\nAs state-owned funds in China have taken on a larger role funding start-ups in the past few years, the entrepreneurial ecosystem has felt pressured to guarantee returns for fear of losing the country\u2019s assets.\n\nDeepSeek is distinctive among Chinese generative AI start-ups in that it has not raised any external financing and has therefore been free from these constraints.\n\nA pure research lab, echoing the early days of DeepMind in the UK and OpenAI in the US, DeepSeek has focused all its effort on pushing the field of AI forward, rather than trying to make money. And even though it prides itself on being entirely founded on homegrown talent, it has adopted a culture often found in the US tech heartland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unique among Chinese AI companies,\u201d says an AI investor in China. \u201cThere is no politics or management friction like at the other big tech companies or larger start-ups. People don\u2019t have specific titles or reporting lines.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s origins as a quantitative hedge fund meant it had engineering talent with a deep understanding of chips. Its breakthrough turned on its apparent success at training advanced AI models without spending the hundreds of millions of dollars its US rivals have.\n\nIt claimed that the final training step for R1 cost only $5.6mn. The figure, however, doesn\u2019t include many other costs involved in developing its models, including computing infrastructure and previous training runs, making it hard to draw precise comparisons.\n\nIt may also have cut corners to save costs: OpenAI claims to have evidence that DeepSeek trained on the output from OpenAI\u2019s own models \u2014 not something allowed under its terms of use, though an underhand practice thought to be widely used by US companies as well.\n\nIronically, Washington\u2019s attempt to hamper China\u2019s AI sector by imposing export controls on high-end US chips from 2022 onwards may have contributed to DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough.\n\nWithout access to leading-edge silicon, the company was forced to find innovative ways to squeeze higher performance out of the less sophisticated chips it was able to buy.\n\nThe company\u2019s claims about the low cost and advanced capabilities of its models have touched off a heated debate about how disruptive the company will turn out to be. Silicon Valley\u2019s leaders have paid tribute to its innovations, while also playing down their significance.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the R1 model \u201cimpressive\u201d, while Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Meta, credited the company with making \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems\u201d.\n\nYet Zuckerberg also cast DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough as just one among many in a field that is moving at breakneck speed, making it hard to tell how deeply its low-cost approach would change the dynamics of the industry, he said.\n\nAccording to some China tech watchers, DeepSeek\u2019s advances aren\u2019t significant enough to change the fact that the country\u2019s AI companies have been fast followers, largely devoted to emulating their US counterparts rather than setting the direction themselves.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek\u2019s work falls into that category. What would really turn the tables in US-China competition is if they built something that actually pushed the frontier. We\u2019ll see if they get there,\u201d says Helen Toner, an AI policy analyst at Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, and a former board member at OpenAI.\n\nYet others say that the fact that a Chinese tech start-up has been behind the latest head-turning advance represents a watershed moment, changing the dynamic in the AI race between the two countries.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek\u2019s latest models may not mean that China is pulling ahead of the US in the AI race, but it does prove that Chinese companies are making remarkable strides in software innovation that mitigate the constraints imposed by US export controls,\u201d wrote Tilly Zhang, a China tech analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, a China-focused research firm, in a note published this week.\n\n\u201cThe race for AI leadership is no longer just about who has access to the best chips, but about who puts them to best use.\u201d\n\nWhile the significance of DeepSeek\u2019s technical breakthroughs is a matter of debate, there is no mistaking the shockwave that passed through the stock market as investors digested the implications of its main innovation: dramatically cutting the cost of training for the most advanced AI models.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s models appear to undermine the argument that US AI companies have made vociferously over the past year: that AI advances require vast amounts of capital and infrastructure to develop and deploy their technology at scale.\n\nInstead, they suggest that far more expensive, US-developed models would have little to differentiate them, raising fears among investors of a sharp deflationary shock.\n\n\u201cThere was a sense of American exceptionalism \u2014 that only America had this technology, and only Americans had the money to do this,\u201d says Jim Tierney, a US growth stock investor at AllianceBernstein. \u201cThe commoditisation of these models is happening much faster than we thought.\u201d\n\nMuch of Silicon Valley fell back on the argument that others in the industry will quickly copy DeepSeek\u2019s innovations, bringing down the cost of training AI models across the board. Executives like Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella claimed it will make the technology more affordable for customers and boost its use \u2014 something that would benefit the entire industry.\n\nIn a sign of the company\u2019s confidence in its status, DeepSeek has published its research and released its models in \u201copen-weights\u201d form, a more limited version of open-source software that allows anyone to download, use and modify the technology.\n\nThe move will attract a wide international following among software developers looking for \u201copen\u201d models to build applications on. Most models developed by Silicon Valley\u2019s leading AI companies remain closed, though there are exceptions \u2014 notably Meta, whose open models have surged in popularity.\n\nBut Deepseek\u2019s model is accessible at a far lower cost. The Chinese company says it charges only 1.4 cents for each 1mn tokens it generates \u2014 roughly equivalent to 700,000 words. By contrast, Meta charges $2.80 for the same output from its largest models.\n\n\u201cA whole number of developers are experimenting with what\u2019s now a Chinese open source AI-based solution,\u201d says Keegan McBride, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute who focuses on the geopolitics of AI. \u201cIt really shows that in the AI space, the US isn\u2019t the only option on the table.\u201d\n\nWhile Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, described DeepSeek in glowing terms as proof that \u201copen-source models are surpassing proprietary ones\u201d, the start-up nonetheless poses a direct challenge to Meta.\n\nThe company\u2019s \u201cclaim to fame has been creating open-weight models that aren\u2019t too far behind the bleeding edge, and DeepSeek just beat them at their own game,\u201d says Toner.\n\nBeyond Deepseek\u2019s impact on the market for AI products, its breakthrough also promises to have geopolitical repercussions, coming at what many believe is a pivotal moment in the competition between the US and China for AI supremacy.\n\nIf R1 and its successors become the global standard for \u201copen\u201d AI models, it would handicap the US, warned Meta\u2019s Zuckerberg. \u201cFor our national advantage, it\u2019s important that it\u2019s an American standard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to build the AI system that people around the world are using.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek has \u201caccelerated the urgency for people in every country to assess\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the technological balance of power emerging between various countries,\u201d says Craig Mundie, a Microsoft veteran and former White House adviser, who counsels OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman on tech policy and strategy.\n\nIf China has managed to get on to an equal footing with the US on AI, it has implications for everything that the technology could eventually be used for, warned Dario Amodei, CEO of US AI start-up Anthropic.\n\n\u201cIt seems likely that China could direct more talent, capital and focus to military applications of the technology,\u201d Amodei wrote of DeepSeek\u2019s advances. \u201cCombined with its large industrial base and military-strategic advantages, this could help China take a commanding lead on the global stage, not just for AI but for everything.\u201d\n\nMundie, who also chairs the US-China AI Dialogue diplomatic forum established by the late US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, pointed out that AI was the \u201cultimate dual use technology\u201d, meaning it has both positive and dangerous purposes.\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek is likely to hang over discussions when the diplomatic group convenes within the next 90 days to discuss a multilateral but common safety structure for AI software, which Mundie writes about in his latest book Genesis, co-authored with Kissinger and Schmidt.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean everyone will have the same laws or rules, but [building] the architecture by which these machines grow up understanding human values and comport with societal choices everywhere in the world, I think is an urgent task,\u201d Mundie says.\n\nMeanwhile, aspiring young entrepreneurs in China are looking towards DeepSeek and its founder as inspiration to build a new generation of powerful technology.\n\nA teenager who came to pay respects at Liang\u2019s house in the village of Mililing this week says: \u201cHe is a pragmatic technologist. He put together a team that\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009surpassed those of companies like OpenAI that we couldn\u2019t compete with before.

The technological challenges it faces are immense. Nuclear experts also warned the initiative could provoke China and Russia to take countermeasures that would nullify its effects. It is partly why the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists moved its \u201cDoomsday clock\u201d one second closer to midnight this week.\n\nThe US president\u2019s executive order, signed on Monday, gives defence secretary Pete Hegseth 60 days to flesh out a plan to defend the US against ballistic, hypersonic and advanced cruise missile attack.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposed system, outlined in the memo, is comprehensive, extraordinarily expensive and a different order of technical sophistication from Israel\u2019s Iron Dome.\n\nThat system defends only small areas from short-range, low-flying and non-nuclear missiles. Trump\u2019s initiative seeks to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles that travel 100 times further and seven times faster. The US is also almost 450 times bigger than Israel.\n\nInstead, Trump\u2019s order demands the deployment of \u201cspace-based interceptors\u201d \u2014 a web of satellites, some equipped with lasers. It then calls for the development of another layer of lower-altitude interceptors if the lasers fail.\n\nIn addition, it demands \u201ccapabilities to defeat missile attacks prior to launch\u201d\u00a0\u2014 in other words, a system that destroys the archer, not just the arrow.\n\nAnalysts say that a leakproof, space-based missile shield is all but impossible. \u201cThere is no magical security blanket,\u201d said Tom Karako, a leading missile expert at the CSIS think-tank in Washington.\n\nTo detect, intercept and destroy ballistic nuclear missiles during their so- called boost phase, the three- to five-minute period before they enter orbit, would require laser beams effective over hundreds of kilometres. No such technology currently exists.\n\nIn part that is due to \u201cthermal blooming\u201d, whereby the energy from a laser heats up the atmosphere surrounding it and reduces the beam\u2019s potency. While the effect is small in the near vacuum of outer space, it is much greater once the beam hits the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nPowering the satellites that fire the lasers would also require them to have mini nuclear reactors, or perhaps an advanced system of solar panels. \u201cThat\u2019s not impossible but\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009would require a major research and investment effort that couldn\u2019t be completed in the short term,\u201d said Fabian Hoffmann, a missile expert at the Oslo Nuclear Project.\n\nThen there are costs, which Trump would need to convince Congress to fund.\n\nA 2012 report by the National Academy of Science found that \u201ceven an austere and limited-capability\u201d space-based defence system would require 650 satellites at a cost of $300bn. It also warned that it would be vulnerable to anti-satellite weapons \u2014 such as the space-based nuclear weapons that Russia has developed recently, according to US intelligence.\n\n\u201cSpace-based missile defences\u00a0have repeatedly been abandoned because they are expensive, very technically challenging and readily defeated,\u201d said Laura Grego, research director for the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nEffective technologies already exist. Ukraine has successfully used western-supplied systems \u2014 such as US-made Patriots and the German-manufactured IRIS-T \u2014 to destroy incoming Russian ballistic and hypersonic missiles.\n\nThe problem, again, is cost. The US already has a $60bn ground-based midcourse missile defence programme. This consists of 44 interceptors, deployed in Alaska and California, which are designed to knock out rogue long-range missiles from foes such as North Korea.\n\nBut as each one costs upwards of $50mn, expanding that system to cover all the US would be vastly expensive.\n\n\u201cOne cannot put active defences everywhere that would be needed to defend cities, critical infrastructure and military sites,\u201d said Stacie Pettyjohn of the Center for a New American Security think-tank.\n\nMoreover, a 2000 technical analysis\u00a0found that even a less-developed country such as North Korea could use long-understood countermeasures, such as decoys or a \u201ccooled shroud\u201d that covers the nuclear warhead to confound heat-seeking interceptor missiles.\n\n\u201cCurrent homeland missile defence systems, despite decades of development, may not even reliably counter rogue state threats,\u201d said Zhao Tong, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\u201cAchieving comprehensive defence against Russia and China\u2019s vastly larger missile arsenals would require astronomical spending without unprecedented technological breakthroughs,\u201d he added.\n\nEven a moderately successful Star Wars 2.0 would strip Russia and China of their retaliatory capability and could prompt them to embark on an accelerated arms race in order to retain nuclear parity.\n\n\u201cIf one [nuclear power] can show it can defend itself while also having first- strike capability [for its nuclear weapons], that is destabilising,\u201d said Manpreet Sethi, head of the nuclear programme at the Centre for Air Power Studies in New Delhi.\n\n\u201cIt is an offensive threat that major power rivals cannot and will not ignore,\u201d said Eric Heginbotham, an expert on Chinese nuclear issues at MIT. \u201cOur\u00a0intent may be defensive\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but whatever the intent, if the capabilities are real, this will be regarded as a critical offensive threat.\u201d\n\nAdversaries could then take easily available countermeasures. Russia, for example, could load more nuclear warheads on existing ballistic missiles, or target areas with weaker defences.\n\n\u201cAdversaries could simply redirect attacks to numerous unprotected population centres \u2014 rendering the defence of select locations strategically meaningless,\u201d Zhao said.\n\nAnalysts argued that a more sober approach would involve the US working to limit countries\u2019 strategic nuclear arsenals \u2014 something Trump backed in a recent speech at Davos.\n\nConventional missile threats could meanwhile be addressed by beefing up lower-altitude systems, based on the ground or US naval ships. The cost would still be huge, but such an approach would be technically feasible and potentially avoid another arms race.\n\n\u201cThe US should focus on strengthening lower-layer missile defences while striving to maintain the current balance of power in the nuclear domain,\u201d Hoffmann said.\n\nThe space-based part of the programme would require hundreds\u00a0of carrier satellites to be launched \u2014 a market currently dominated by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\nAlthough the US government has other contractors capable of sending carrier satellites into space, Musk\u2019s rockets have a higher payload capacity, higher payload volume and are substantially cheaper than most competitors. They\u00a0are also being launched at much greater\u00a0frequency, with one launch on average every three days last year.\n\n\u201cA lot of people stand to make money,\u201d said Grego of the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nThere would be trade-offs, however. SpaceX already has $20bn worth of government\u00a0contracts and would probably have to sacrifice capacity reserved for populating its Starlink constellation \u2014 the company\u2019s biggest revenue driver.\n\nAll this assumes the space-based programme, which Grego described as a \u201cfantasy\u201d, will be approved by Congress and goes ahead.\n\nCartography by Steven Bernard", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/62c01967-0100-46ee-9f4f-e9af467d7604"}}, {"id": "141328f0-228b-40df-91b2-bba638662257", "event_name": "With DeepSeek, China innovates and the US imitates ", "blurb": "The start-up\u2019s breakthrough confounds outworn prejudices about the two countries  ", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "Triumphalist glee lit up the Chinese internet this week. Just as Google DeepMind\u2019s victory over China\u2019s strongest Go player in 2017 showcased western brilliance in artificial intelligence, so DeepSeek\u2019s release of a world-beating AI reasoning model has this month been celebrated as a stunning success in China.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s smarter and cheaper AI model was a \u201cscientific and technological achievement that shapes our national destiny\u201d, said one Chinese tech executive. The start-up had become a key player in the \u201cChinese Large-Model Technology Avengers Team\u201d that would counter US AI dominance, said another.\n\nChina\u2019s delight, however, spelled pain for several giant US technology companies as investors questioned whether DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough undermined the case for their colossal spending on AI infrastructure. US tech and energy stocks lost $1tn of their market value on Monday, although they regained some ground later in the week.\n\nThe stereotypical image of China abroad may still be that of a state-subsidised, capital-intensive manufacturing economy that excels at churning out impressive low-cost hardware, such as smartphones, solar panels and electric vehicles. But, in truth, China long ago emerged as a global software superpower, outstripping the west in ecommerce and digital financial services, and it has invested massively in AI, too.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s emergence confounds many of the outworn prejudices about Chinese innovation, although it is far from a typical Chinese company. It certainly invalidates the old saw that while the US innovates, China imitates and Europe regulates. In several ways, DeepSeek resembles a bootstrapped Silicon Valley start-up, even if it was not founded in a garage. Launched in 2023, the company has the same high-flown ambition as OpenAI and Google DeepMind to attain human-level AI, or artificial general intelligence (AGI). But its founder Liang Wenfeng runs one of China\u2019s leading hedge funds, meaning the company has not had to raise external financing.\n\nIn an interview republished in the China Talk newsletter, Liang explained that DeepSeek operated more as a research lab than a commercial enterprise. When recruiting, it prioritised capabilities over credentials, hiring young Chinese-educated researchers. Liang said these people were given the space to explore and the freedom to make mistakes. \u201cInnovation often arises naturally \u2014 it\u2019s not something that can be deliberately planned or taught,\u201d he said.\n\nDeepSeek relies on open-source AI models, such as Meta\u2019s Llama, in contrast to the proprietary models favoured by OpenAI and Google. It also focuses narrowly on language in its quest to reach AGI rather than attempting to go multimodal and incorporating images, audio and video. \u201cWhat you think of as \u2018thinking\u2019 might actually be your brain weaving language. This suggests that humanlike AGI could potentially emerge from language models,\u201d he said.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s focused approach has enabled it to develop a compelling reasoning model without the need for extraordinary computing power and seemingly at a fraction of the cost of its US competitors. As with other Chinese apps, US politicians have been quick to raise security and privacy concerns about DeepSeek. And OpenAI has even accused the Chinese company of possible breaches of intellectual property rights. Given the cases against OpenAI for infringing others\u2019 copyright, though, that might strike some as rich.\n\nWhile some big US tech companies responded to DeepSeek\u2019s model with disguised alarm, many developers were quick to pounce on the opportunities the technology might generate. The capabilities and cheapness of DeepSeek\u2019s reasoning model may allow them to deploy it for an ever-expanding number of uses. On Monday, DeepSeek was the most downloaded free app on the US Apple App Store.\n\nIronically, that may yet enable the US to benefit more from DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough than China. Over the past few years, China has been throttling its own private sector as the state has exerted tighter control. The number of start-ups launched in China has plummeted since 2018. According to PitchBook, venture capital funding in China fell 37 per cent to $40.2bn last year while rising strongly in the US.\n\nDeepSeek has punctured the hubris of the US tech oligarchs. It has intensified global competition and will accelerate the adoption of AI tools. Temporarily this could be a case of China innovating and the US imitating. But is it just a spectacular blip or the start of a long-term trend?\n\njohn.thornhill@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d72e0750-6a8b-4ef4-b9e1-6d35fd2a69b8"}}, {"id": "c2c859e7-d902-445f-99c1-e8e3a1b0a609", "event_name": "\u2018Back to 1897\u2019: Latin America scrambles to respond to Donald Trump\u2019s aggression", "blurb": "Colombia\u2019s President Gustavo Petro finds little support for confrontational stance against US", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "Latin American presidents will hold an emergency summit on Thursday to respond to President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportations of migrants as they reel from his aggressive tactics towards two of Washington\u2019s traditional regional allies.\n\nTrump clamped 25 per cent tariffs on trade with Colombia and imposed visa and other sanctions on Sunday after leftwing President Gustavo Petro turned back US military flights deporting migrants. The confrontation ended within hours after Bogot\u00e1 caved in to Washington\u2019s demands.\n\nThe dramatic clash, much of it conducted over social media, unsettled Latin American nations already scared by Trump\u2019s threats of military force to re-establish US control over the Panama Canal and of steep tariffs on Mexico, the US\u2019s biggest trading partner.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of alarm among the Latin American embassies in Washington,\u201d said a senior regional diplomat in Washington. \u201cWe seem to have gone back to 1897 and the era of President [William] McKinley, who invaded Cuba and the Philippines.\u201d\n\nEmerging market currencies were rattled by Sunday\u2019s dispute, with the Mexican peso and South African rand both falling about two per cent against the US dollar. Colombia\u2019s peso fell 1.5 per cent against the dollar on Monday morning before recovering a little ground.\n\nPanama, a nation of just 4.5mn people with no army and a heavy dependence on US trade and investment, is seen as particularly vulnerable to Trump\u2019s demands for Washington to take back control of the canal it built more than a century ago. The US president has claimed China now operates the canal and US shipping is being \u201cripped off\u201d by the charges to use the waterway.\n\nHonduran President Xiomara Castro called an emergency summit of the region\u2019s leaders in her capacity as head of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac), after a request by Petro. The meeting will discuss migration, the environment and regional unity, she said on X.\n\nMichael Shifter, a senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue think-tank in Washington, said Latin American leaders were unlikely to defer to Trump.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to try to strike a balance,\u201d he said, \u201crecognising that on the one hand, they have to be pragmatic because Trump is actually capable of imposing sanctions, which would be very painful for these countries. On the other side, they really have to save face as well and show they have national pride and protect sovereignty.\u201d\n\nRussian allies Cuba and Venezuela gave swift backing to Petro, a former guerrilla with a long record of rants against US policy on social media on issues ranging from Gaza to the war on drugs. But the region\u2019s biggest powers, Brazil and Mexico, did not comment publicly.\n\nDiplomats said they wanted to co-ordinate positions discreetly and let the dust settle before taking a public stance.\n\n\u201cPetro has given a lesson in how not to deal with Trump,\u201d said a second regional diplomat. \u201cHe went into battle on social media without having a way to sustain his fight.\u201d\n\nSeveral commentators pointed out the Colombian leader had undermined his own position by previously agreeing to take US military flights deporting migrants, which date back years under Democrat and Republican administrations.\n\nColombia, traditionally the closest US ally in South America, is heavily reliant on the US market for its exports of oil, coffee and cut flowers, and has little leverage with Washington.\n\nThe timing was also awkward, with Colombia\u2019s foreign minister Luis Gilberto Murillo \u2014 a pragmatic English speaker and ex-ambassador to Washington \u2014 due to be replaced on February 1 by Laura Sarabia, Petro\u2019s 30-year-old chief of staff, who has no diplomatic experience.\n\nWith Petro\u2019s whereabouts on Sunday unclear, a crisis team made up of Sarabia, Murillo and other officials met in the presidential palace and the foreign ministry headquarters. The main interlocutor on the US side, diplomats said, was Mauricio Claver-Carone, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Latin America in the state department. \u201cPetro was in constant communication, always listening and responding,\u201d said a person with direct knowledge of the talks.\n\nBruce Mac Master, president of Colombia\u2019s main business association, spent the day lobbying Petro\u2019s diplomatic team, and spoke with Sarabia several times.\n\n\u201cI think Petro had no idea of the dimensions and impact of US relations,\u201d Mac Master said. \u201cHe soon realised that the effects would be felt everywhere, starting with the exchange rate. I think he learned more about economics from that than he had in the rest of his life.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Mexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum is seen in the region as having handled Trump better. She has made her disagreements with US policy clear in measured public comments, while privately agreeing to many of Trump\u2019s demands on taking back migrants and cracking down on fentanyl trafficking.\n\nChina has hugely expanded its trade and investment in Latin America this century, and Beijing is likely to view Trump\u2019s unpredictable moves as an ideal opportunity to present itself as a more reliable partner, diplomats and analysts said.\n\nShifter, of Inter-American Dialogue, said: \u201cCelac is the platform for China in Latin America, so Thursday\u2019s summit is a kind of proxy for showing [Washington] that if [it is] really going to punish us, then China\u2019s willing to fill the gap and come in even more than it has already.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Tommy Stubbington in London", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/feaa544c-ca50-46f1-aeb0-770d190fdf14"}}, {"id": "c5885ff3-ea1f-498a-90ad-e85c2ea1818f", "event_name": "Donald Trump hits Canada, Mexico and China with steep tariffs", "blurb": "US president fires starting gun on trade war with levies of up to 25% on goods imported from trading partners", "date": "2025-02-0200:00:00.0", "body": "Donald Trump hit Canada, Mexico and China with steep tariffs on Saturday in a move that launches a new era of trade wars between the US and three of its largest trading partners.\n\nTrump issued an executive order applying additional tariffs of 25 per cent to all imports from Canada and Mexico, with the exception of Canadian oil and energy products, which will face a 10 per cent levy. Canada is by far the biggest foreign oil supplier to the US, accounting for about 60 per cent of its crude imports.\n\nImports from China will face a 10 per cent tariff over and above existing US tariffs.\n\nPosting on Truth Social, Trump said he used emergency powers to issue the tariffs \u201cbecause of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl\u201d.\n\nThe tariffs would apply from Tuesday, the White House said.\n\nAn administration official said each order contained \u201ca retaliation clause\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. so that if any country chooses to retaliate in any way, the signal will be to take further action with respect to likely increased tariffs\u201d.\n\nIn response, Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced 25 per cent tariffs on C$155bn (US$107bn) worth of goods, including US alcohol, clothing, household appliances and lumber.\n\nTrudeau said tariffs would put US jobs at risk, \u201cpotentially shutting down American auto assembly plants and other manufacturing facilities. They will raise costs for you, including food at the grocery stores and gas at the pump\u201d.\n\nMexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum said the country would also launch retaliatory tariffs and other measures.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t solve problems by imposing tariffs, but with talking and dialogue,\u201d she wrote on X.\n\nIn Beijing on Sunday, the foreign ministry said China \u201cfirmly deplores and opposes this move\u201d and will take \u201cnecessary countermeasures to defend its rights and issues\u201d.\n\nIt said the tariffs were imposed \u201cunder the pretext of the fentanyl issue\u201d, but that it is \u201cone of the world\u2019s toughest countries on counternarcotics both in terms of policy and its implementation\u201d.\n\nZhiwei Zhang,\u00a0chief economist at\u00a0Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note that the 10 per cent tariff was \u201cnot a big shock to China\u2019s economy\u201d and was \u201cunlikely to change the market expectation on China\u2019s macro outlook this year\u201d.\n\nThe moves were roundly condemned by industry groups and economists, with the US Chamber of Commerce warning they would \u201craise prices for American families and upend supply chains\u201d.\n\nThe largest US fossil fuel lobby group, the American Petroleum Institute, warned that North American energy markets were \u201chighly integrated,\u201d and that free trade was \u201ccritical\u201d.\n\nThe president used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, an executive authority that allows him to respond to emergencies through economic means, to apply the levies without congressional approval. The law has not previously been used to enact tariffs, although Trump threatened to use it against Mexico in 2019.\n\nTrump\u2019s abrupt opening move will dash the hopes of countries that expected a slower and more cautious approach to trade policy after the Trump administration ordered a raft of reviews into US commercial relationships on inauguration day.\n\nIt also signals the president\u2019s willingness to use tariffs to apply pressure to allies on issues ranging from immigration to drug trafficking. Trump has justified the tariffs by complaining about what he says is lax security at the borders with Mexico and Canada, and arguing that both \u2014 along with China \u2014 have failed to do enough to stem the flow of deadly opioids into the US.\n\nOn Saturday, a White House official said the tariffs would be lifted as soon as \u201cAmericans stop dying from Made in China, distributed by Mexico and Canada fentanyl\u201d.\n\nThe official added: \u201cThis is not just about fentanyl\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. this is really a border security issue.\u201d\n\nTrump has also cited America\u2019s trade deficit with Canada, Mexico and China as justification for the tariffs. On Friday, he acknowledged that they may cause some \u201cdisruption\u201d, but added: \u201cThe tariffs are going to make us very rich, and very strong.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Trump said he planned to levy tariffs on EU imports too, but Saturday\u2019s announcement did not include any measures relating to the EU.\n\nTrump held back from imposing the 60 per cent tariff on Chinese imports from\u00a0China that he had threatened during the presidential campaign. The 10 per cent levy was designed to punish Beijing over the flow of ingredients to make fentanyl, a deadly opiate that has been the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45 over the past three years.\n\nBeijing cracked down on the export of fentanyl several years ago, but groups in China switched to exporting precursor chemicals to cartels in Mexico to produce the final product.\n\nDimitry Anastakis, a professor of business at the University of Toronto, said the US tariffs\u00a0could be a shock to the system as painful as the Covid pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt is unnecessary and quite stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is taking a sledge hammer to a non-existent problem with the North American economy that was working pretty well.\u201d\n\nAnastakis said there will be immediate pain in the auto trade, job losses and a likely recession in Canada.\n\nAdditional reporting by Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b9101226-edc1-4cde-93ec-186bc95021d7"}}, {"id": "1a63a576-5823-4f64-914d-92c38417b3b2", "event_name": "Where \u2018woke\u2019 went wrong\u00a0", "blurb": "Seemingly irresistible just a few years ago, movements aimed at addressing systemic inequalities are now in retreat.

Mark Zuckerberg, who had once celebrated Facebook\u2019s role in making #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter viral, now said its parent company needed more \u201cmasculine energy\u201d and would end its targets for hiring women and minorities.\u00a0Corporate America had gone from taking the knee to bending it.\n\nBut perhaps equally telling has been the loss of faith among the revolution\u2019s natural supporters. Kamala Harris, who once criticised Joe Biden\u2019s record on desegregation, backed away from wokeness. (Trump ads still said: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d) In the UK Keir Starmer changed his view on trans rights. Between 2021 and 2024, the proportion of British people who said efforts to ensure equal opportunities for trans people hadn\u2019t gone far enough fell from 32 per cent to 22 per cent.\n\nProgressive activists could once insist that criticisms of their causes were confected. This has become harder. The critics included people, such as philosophers Sam Harris and Susan Neiman, who define themselves as on the left.\n\nThe achievement of Black Lives Matter was to make support almost the default option. Shortly after George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis in 2020, protesters\u2019 signs read simply: \u201cWhite silence is violence.\u201d The movement was not hoping to persuade people. It was expecting them to participate.\n\nIn this, Black Lives Matter was initially hugely successful. Within weeks of Floyd\u2019s murder, perhaps 20mn Americans, an unprecedented number, went on marches. Government policies were examined for implicit bias. Bosses looked around their offices and asked why they were so white. Workshops were organised, donations promised, senior appointments made. Statues were felled; company logos based on Black stereotypes were replaced.\n\nIn the years before, other movements had similar success. #MeToo called out male sexual abuse. LGBT+ campaigners highlighted the difficulties faced by trans people. After the celebrated expansion of gay rights, lots of people wanted to be on the right side of history. They added rainbows to their online profiles and pronouns to their email signatures. Trans celebrities became sought-after brand ambassadors.\n\nToday, however, many progressives have decided that speaking up is no longer so urgent. Silence has resumed. If these movements are to rise again, they need to overcome not just their opponents, but their own limitations.\n\nThe term \u201cwoke\u201d emerged from the American Black community to describe awareness of the injustices faced by Black people, later gaining currency among the wider left. Critics on the right took the word and made it pejorative, just as they weaponised \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d in the 1990s. Today they often deploy it disingenuously.\n\nWokeness \u2014 there is still no better term \u2014 now describes attempts to address systemic inequalities faced by disadvantaged groups, including women, people of colour, LGBT+ people and those with disabilities. It assumes that people can discriminate unconsciously by upholding inequitable norms.\n\nTo many supporters, these attempts continued campaigns such as the US civil rights movement. Those past revolutions had been only partly successful. The killing of Floyd, and others such as teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, showed that the law was still not equally applied to Black people in the US. Old inequalities persisted. New ones emerged: tech companies apologised after their algorithms generated racist results.\n\nIf wokeness faced resistance, supporters could point to those who had opposed civil rights in the 1960s, or who had moaned about the suppression of sexist and racist jokes in the 1990s.\n\nThe problem, as writer Yascha Mounk argues in his book The Identity Trap, is that the new activism was built on a rejection of the civil rights movement\u2019s optimistic pursuit of equality and racial integration. Its foundations lay in the post-structuralism of Michel Foucault, in postcolonial studies and in critical race theory. Derrick Bell, founder of critical race theory, argued in 1991 that Black people in the US had in effect seen no progress since slavery, and that yearning for racial equality was a \u201cfantasy\u201d.\n\nBell\u2019s precise words may not have spread widely, but examples of woke over-reach did. In 2020-21, Black Lives Matter activists occupied the city of Portland for months, causing millions of dollars of damage. Calls to \u201cdefund the police\u201d complicated law enforcement in many US cities, allowing critics to question if it was inadvertently making life more dangerous, not less.\n\nLess grave, but equally eye-catching, was some counterintuitive theorising. Some descriptions of racial equity suggested that punctuality was a trait of \u201cwhiteness\u201d. Some trans rights activists adopted the terms \u201cLatinx\u201d and \u201cpeople who menstruate\u201d \u2014 terms that most of the people they were referring to would reject.\n\nIn the 1990s, political correctness meant saying \u201cchair\u201d instead of \u201cchairman\u201d, and \u201csex worker\u201d instead of \u201cprostitute\u201d (the idea of calling short people \u201cvertically challenged\u201d came from critics). Recent conceptual and linguistic shifts were arguably much sharper. \u201cWhite privilege\u201d, \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d and \u201ccisgender\u201d entered the lexicon.\n\nEven away from these extremes, \u201cwokeness\u201d clashed with some tenets of liberal society. It defined people as being part of a group, not as individuals. It encouraged people to identify as Black, queer or whatever else. For Robin DiAngelo, the white author of the bestselling book White Fragility, white people were inherently racist.\n\nAll this ran counter to the civil rights era\u2019s focus on equality and to how many citizens wished to see themselves. As early as 2015, veteran civil rights activist Barbara Reynolds argued that Black Lives Matter was mistaken in not claiming the slogan \u201call lives matter\u201d for its own (and for not adopting the church-inspired respectability of 1960s protesters).\n\nInside companies, group awareness was initially welcomed: staff networks for Black, Asian, LGBT+, disabled people and others sprung up. But bosses now admit to second thoughts. \u201cWere we beginning to focus too much on all these areas of difference, versus saying this is fundamentally about inclusion and respecting difference, rather than necessarily needing to call it out?\u201d says Peter Cheese, chief executive of CIPD, the UK\u2019s body for HR professionals. \u201cWe can\u2019t deal with every aspect of people\u2019s difference at work.\u201d\n\nCompanies invested in anti-bias training, including from DiAngelo. But some evidence suggested that it had little effect. While diversity programmes focused on race and gender, conversations on class were often lacking. \u201c[Employees would say,] what do you mean \u2018white privilege\u2019? I came from a working-class background and I\u2019ve worked my way up,\u201d says Kamal Munir, a professor at Cambridge\u2019s Judge Business School. \u201cIt was also seen as a zero-sum game.\u201d\n\nClass wasn\u2019t the only blind spot. The epithet \u201cKaren\u201d emerged to refer to entitled white women: it went from light-hearted meme to blatant sexism. In May 2023, Uber\u2019s head of diversity left after employees complained that her \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Karen\u201d training sessions were too focused on white people\u2019s hardships.\n\nA key demand for campaigners was the representation of disadvantaged groups. This had liberating effects. After #OscarsSoWhite went viral in 2015, when all 20 acting nominations went to white people, more actors of colour started to be recognised. Representation was long overdue. But it is not the whole ballgame. Does Emilia P\u00e9rez, a Netflix film about Mexican cartel violence, not deserve its Oscar nominations because it was made by mostly non-Mexican cast and crew? As the director pointed out in his defence, Shakespeare never went to Verona. In 2021, an award-winning, non-binary Dutch novelist, chosen to translate the work of the Black American poet Amanda Gorman, stepped down after criticism that a Black translator should do the job.\n\nIn less high-profile contexts, who was speaking came to overshadow what they said. It can be powerful, and funny, to question an opinion on the basis that it comes from a white man. Deployed repetitively, it short-circuits debate. Listening to speakers preface their comments with their identity became exhausting.\n\nActivists also set about changing what it was acceptable to say, or be associated with. Ibram X Kendi, author of the bestselling book How to Be an Antiracist, apologised for using \u201cableist\u201d terms such as \u201ccrazy\u201d, \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cdumb\u201d. Robin DiAngelo listed things white people should not say, including: \u201cI can\u2019t say anything right.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, the football team LA Galaxy released a player after his wife posted racist messages on Instagram, even though he disavowed them (he became the Serbian Super League\u2019s top scorer). A British children\u2019s author was dropped by her publisher for expressing support for JK Rowling\u2019s views on trans issues (she became a truck driver).\n\nThis strictness was politically inadvisable. In 2018 and again in 2021, a majority of Americans said they didn\u2019t want political correctness to go further. Barack Obama rightly judged that voters didn\u2019t want to feel as though they were \u201cwalking on eggshells\u201d; they wanted acknowledgment that \u201clife is messy\u201d.\n\nIn its purer forms, wokeness offered not tolerance and debate, but punishment and re-education. This was intellectually wrong. Many people could accept that racial discrimination existed, and that Floyd\u2019s murder was horrific. But they disagreed with the weight that activists put on discrimination. A US survey found that white progressives were more likely than Black and Hispanic people to say that racism is built into US society \u2014 and less likely to say that most people can get ahead if they work hard.\n\nRadical societal changes deserved debate. This was most notable on trans issues. Did giving puberty blockers to children raise questions of informed consent and long-term health risks? Even asking such questions was frowned upon, right up to 2024, when a review of NHS England\u2019s gender identity service concluded the use of puberty blockers rested on \u201cweak evidence\u201d.\n\nLGBT+ campaigners had reasons for not wishing to be drawn into such debates. As Shon Faye argued in her book The Transgender Issue, media framing could itself be oppressive. Trans people felt their existence mocked. Many also distrusted the medical establishment, which they felt had neglected their needs. There was a view that questioning trans campaigners\u2019 outlook made trans people less safe \u2014 both psychologically, but also physically, because it could lead to policy changes where trans healthcare was further restricted.\n\nBut the result was unsatisfactory. Trans activists often labelled their critics as \u201ctransphobic\u201d. The public had signed up to colourful LGBT+ Pride rainbows; they now often saw toxic social media debates. (Critics also bore much responsibility for the toxicity.) For many who were gently supportive of the cause, it marked trans issues as worth steering clear of.\n\nEventually the law defended free speech. In 2021, a British employment tribunal ruled that a woman called Maya Forstater had been unlawfully discriminated against, when her contract was not renewed because of her gender-critical views.\n\nSimilarly, racial diversity efforts clashed with basic employment rules. Previously employers could talk about hiring a candidate from a more diverse background if two candidates were equal. This was always dubious: two candidates are never equal, and a thumb could always be placed on the scales in one direction or another.\n\nAround 2020, some organisations wanted to go faster in hiring diverse candidates. (Being a woman, or Jewish, was probably not sufficient.) At least in some cases, they clearly discriminated against white employees. In 2022 Britain\u2019s Thames Valley Police promoted an Asian officer without a competitive process; three white officers who weren\u2019t given the chance to apply later won a discrimination claim. Perhaps the law should give employers greater leeway to address society\u2019s inequalities. But it did not. Again, the managers who wanted to drive change from the inside, and the activists on the outside, were moving faster than liberal society, and most people\u2019s sense of fairness, could handle.\n\nThe intense social activism of mid-2020 \u2014 heightened by outrage at the Trump presidency, and perhaps the emotional strain of Covid \u2014 was never sustainable. By April 2024, 52 per cent of Americans thought the US had done enough to make up for past discrimination against Black people. 2020 showed how permeable companies were to prevailing political winds. Those winds became the economy and immigration.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s hard to disentangle the rise and fall of \u201cwoke\u201d from US politics. This month, when Zuckerberg rolled back Meta\u2019s diversity initiatives, and changed its moderation policies so that users could post things such as \u201cGays are freaks\u201d, the company explained: \u201cIt\u2019s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms.\u201d For less spineless bosses too, the changing political moment was useful cover to push back at activists\u2019 and diversity managers\u2019 strictures.\n\nThe woke revolution might have lasted longer had progressives not been so sceptical of universal ideas and free debate. Voters are not part of an anti-woke crusade. Trans issues don\u2019t register in British voters\u2019 priorities. A majority of Britons support supposedly woke ideas, like returning the Parthenon marbles to Greece. Two-thirds of Americans support DEI programmes. But many of them did become disengaged from the movements that they had once supported.\n\nThis might have been more manageable if activists were as well-organised as their most cynical opponents. Instead, Black Lives Matter lacked established leaders and structures. (In both the US and the UK, activists were jailed for fraudulent use of donations.) Soon progressives had also lost arguably their most influential social network, Twitter: it soured with abuse, then was corrupted by Musk.\n\nWere he alive, Derrick Bell might argue that the backlash is proof that racism always reasserts itself. But for believers in progress, the woke revolution can claim plenty of victories. It aimed higher than the move to political correctness, and it propelled forward awareness of race, gender and sexual identity. Within corporations, \u201ca lot of progress was made\u201d, says Munir at the University of Cambridge. \u201cPeople did make a lot of effort to tap more diverse talent pools. [But] progress is never linear.\u201d\n\nThe fate of diversity initiatives dovetails with that of climate policies. Just because climate action is less politically fashionable does not mean it is less urgent. And just because Black Lives Matter and trans rights are no longer the zeitgeist does not mean economic and social disparities have been closed. \u201cSilence is violence\u201d is one of many things that progressive activists were wrong about. But silence is not the best strategy either.\n\nHenry Mance is the FT\u2019s chief features writer\n\nComments on this story will open at 9am GMT on Sunday\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5ba3c3a8-8ccb-414e-b299-41f5b0e29021"}}, {"id": "1a419d25-6a05-42a5-a229-f915178dc257", "event_name": "Trump tariffs spark panic and anger in Canada and Mexico", "blurb": "US president\u2019s move threatens to disrupt North America\u2019s economy and overturn decades of integration", "date": "2025-02-0200:00:00.0", "body": "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada and Mexico sparked panic and condemnation from the US\u2019s top trading partners, who said the levies would devastate North America\u2019s economy and overturn decades of integration.\n\nPoliticians, business leaders and trade associations in all three countries reacted with disbelief, warning the tariffs would bring inflation, supply chain disruption and widespread job losses.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing across-the-board 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods starting on Tuesday and 10 per cent tariffs on energy. He also imposed an additional 10 per cent tariff on goods from China.\n\nTrump said the levy would be placed on goods from Canada and Mexico to \u201chold them accountable\u201d for promises to halt illegal drug and migration flows into the US.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced reciprocal 25 per cent tariffs on a range of US goods, while\u00a0Mexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum also announced tariffs without giving details.\n\nThe new trade barriers would slow growth and accelerate inflation in all three countries for the next few years, with the biggest shocks for Mexico and Canada, economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated.\n\nThey will also upend decades of deepening integration in North America. Mexico and Canada send more than three-quarters of their exports to the US, underpinned by a three-way trade agreement, USMCA, signed during Trump\u2019s last presidency.\n\n\u201cTariffs will drastically increase the cost of everything for everyone: every day these tariffs are in place it hurts families, communities, and businesses,\u201d Candace Laing, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said.\n\n\u201cWith $20bn in annual steel trade between our nations, these tariffs will cause significant disruption and economic hardship in both Canada and the United States,\u201d said\u00a0Catherine Cobden, president of the Canadian Steel Producers Association.\n\nUS companies with operations across the region will be affected. The US Chamber of Commerce said the tariffs would disrupt supply chains.\n\nTrump has long focused his ire on the US southern border with Mexico, but he made clear in the executive order that he sees Canada as part of the problem.\n\n\u201cCriminal networks are implicated in human trafficking and smuggling operations, enabling unvetted illegal migration across our northern border,\u201d the executive order states.\n\nXavi Delgado of the Canada Institute at the Wilson Centre in Washington DC said the US never told Canada what actions it must take at the northern border.\n\n\u201cThe president can only implement tariffs through the IEEPA [International Emergency Economic Powers Act] in response to an \u2018unusual and extraordinary threat.\u2019 Even if the White House believes that its trade deficit with Canada is unfair, that does not constitute an extraordinary threat; a crisis at the northern border, as they are describing it, would,\u201d he said.\n\nLeaders in Mexico\u2019s private sector said there was panic and deep nervousness after Trump\u2019s announcement. Many had hoped the country would benefit from a second Trump term, with few believing he would follow through on his threats.\n\nPedro Casas Alatriste, director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico, said the tariffs were a step back for a relationship built over decades.\n\n\u201cThe companies and consumers of the three economies will suffer consequences if this measure isn\u2019t reversed: rise[s] in costs for producers and exporters, loss of jobs, inflation and less purchasing power for our families,\u201d he said.\n\nMexico\u2019s economy is already slowing and is expected to fall into a recession if the tariffs are imposed for a substantial period. Tiff Macklem, governor of the Bank of Canada, has said US tariffs would also likely put Canada in a recession.\n\n\u201cThe only winners from the imposition of tariffs against Mexico and Canada by the United States are North America\u2019s main competitors,\u201d Kenneth Smith, a Mexican former trade negotiator said, adding that it damaged US credibility as a trading partner.\n\nMexicans were shocked by the language used in the White House fact sheet on the tariffs, which accuses Sheinbaum\u2019s government directly of having an \u201cintolerable alliance\u201d with the country\u2019s drug cartels. It was not clear what Mexico could do to have the tariffs removed.\n\nSince Trump was elected and started threatening tariffs in November, Canadian and Mexican delegations have been trying to convince the president that such measures would also hurt the US economy.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans have also raised concerns about the president\u2019s tariff announcement, highlighting Canada was their main trading partner.\n\nJohn Llewelyn, partner at Independent Economics, a consultancy, and a former economist at the OECD, said that the main consequence of the tariffs would be inflation, with all countries likely to get hurt, including the US.\n\n\u201cThe 80-year era of stability in the rules and conduct of economic and financial relations between countries ended today,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in the US\u00a0said Beijing\u00a0\u201cfirmly deplores and opposes\u201d the tariffs and\u00a0would take \u201cnecessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cTrade and tariff wars have no winners,\u201d said embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu. \u201cThe US\u2019s unilateral tariff hikes severely violate WTO [World Trade Organization] rules.\u201d\n\nHe added that the US \u201cneeds to view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way instead of threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes\u201d.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4a09c580-055b-4252-9994-8961bcba53e9"}}, {"id": "40a48b25-92ae-4da5-b0cd-8cb0f531a804", "event_name": "\u2018A trade war on steroids\u2019: Trump ushers in new era of US protectionism", "blurb": "President bets he can achieve his aims through tariffs without igniting inflation or a sell-off in American stocks", "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Donald Trump has long declared himself a \u201ctariff man\u201d willing to impose sweeping levies on imports from countries that have hurt America.\n\nBut on Saturday, the 78-year old US president took the first dramatic step of his second term towards putting that vision into practice \u2014 placing trade wars and economic nationalism at the top of his agenda.\n\nFrom his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump unleashed aggressive new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, a day after threatening the EU with high levies.\n\nTrump is gambling that he can pressure US trading partners to comply with Washington\u2019s wishes without triggering another damaging acceleration of inflation, at a time when the cost of living remains the top concern of many Americans.\n\nFor the world, Trump\u2019s opening gambit on trade means a series of countries will be forced into bruising negotiations over everything from trade deficits and currency policy to immigration and even America\u2019s new desire for territorial expansion. Financial markets could be shaken and the global economy may suffer.\n\n\u201cThese tariffs herald a new era of US trade protectionism that will affect all American trading partners, whether rivals or allies, and will significantly disrupt international commerce,\u201d says Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University.\n\nThe hardest-hit economies will be Mexico and Canada given their heavy reliance on the US economy, with both facing outright recessions if Trump maintains the 25 per cent tariffs, economists said. The damage will be compounded by the fact that less than six years ago, those countries signed a new trade agreement with Trump in the hope that it would stabilise relations with the US.\n\n\u201cThere are no safe havens,\u201d says Brad Setser, a former US Treasury official now at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cTwo countries that struck the biggest trade deal with Donald Trump in his first term are the first two to get hit with tariffs.\u201d\n\nNeil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, said the macroeconomic effects would depend on how comprehensive the US tariff package was, and how quickly it gets imposed.Some of the impact could be mitigated by appreciation of the dollar and substitution of domestically produced US goods, while corporations may choose to absorb some of the increase in costs via lower profit margins, economists said. But the magnitude of Trump\u2019s first steps \u2014 if fully implemented \u2014 appeared far greater than the more limited trade wars against China and G7 allies during his last time in office.\n\n\u201cThis could be a trade war on steroids,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cThe first round was more targeted. Now they seem to be going across the board \u2014 and faster than I expected,\u201d he added.\n\nEverett Eissenstat, a former Trump economic adviser now at Squire Patton Boggs, said: \u201cI expected the tariffs to go in in a more measured manner. But we can say there is one direction here, and that is that it seems to be escalating.\u201d\n\nThe first tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China may only be the beginning. Trump officials have been considering imposing universal tariffs on all imports, and adding to the levies he imposed on Saturday.\n\nTrump now wants to use tariffs to generate revenue to pay for the extension of trillions of dollars of tax cuts, which can only be achieved through carefully calibrated but hefty levies that could be hard to reverse.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to raising revenue, if the tariff is too low it won\u2019t raise enough money, if it\u2019s too high it will stop trade and then you won\u2019t make any money. They will need to find the sweet spot\u201d, says Bill Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nAs Trump doubles down on tariffs, he faces little resistance from business groups and free-market Republicans who have traditionally balked at his populist policies and sought to rein him in. Jim Risch, the Idaho senator who chairs the Senate foreign relations committee, cheered his latest moves.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has always been very clear that if he sees Americans being taken advantage of, he won\u2019t put up with it,\u201d he said. Referring to Canada, Mexico, and China, he added: \u201cThese governments know very well that they need to stem the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants into our country. The sooner they do that, the better.\u201d\n\nBut there are two big dangers for Trump. One would be a sell-off that sends equity markets and the value of Americans\u2019 retirement plans plunging. The other would be that inflation picks up again after gradually falling towards its 2 per cent target over the past two and a half years.\n\nShearing said that Trump\u2019s proposed measures could push headline PCE inflation above 3 per cent, compared with 2.6 per cent now. Hefty levies on the EU and China would push US price growth even higher, he warned.\u201cThat is a big hit, especially for working families including people who voted for Trump on the rationale that he would reduce prices,\u201d said James Knightley, chief international economist in the US at ING.\u201cThe risks are we see some real pain for the household sector coming through later this year, especially if he expands tariffs on Europe.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, who have been looking for ways to attack Trump early in his second term, have already pounced on the potential for higher inflation.\n\n\u201cSlapping huge tariffs on gas, groceries, phones, TVs and cars means working American families are going to pay more for the things they need,\u201d said Ron Wyden, the Oregon senator, on Friday.\n\n\u201cThese tariffs only make sense as class warfare, forcing typical Americans to foot the bill for another round of tax breaks for Trump and his rich buddies.\u201d\n\nTrump has found comfort in the fact that inflation remained subdued during the trade wars of his first term.\n\nBut Jay Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, noted last week that conditions had changed compared with the structurally low-inflation environment before the pandemic. \u201cYou\u2019re coming through a situation where we\u2019re not quite back to 2 per cent and that\u2019s just different,\u201d he said. For the global economy, one potentially bleak scenario would be that of \u201cmassive supply shock\u201d, said Knightley, similar to the shocks economies weathered during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThe risk is that this is going to be quite damaging, especially if we see a significant response. And I don\u2019t see how politicians don\u2019t respond.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/32bedf88-cf5d-494e-ae45-4f94a3cec6f9"}}, {"id": "07c125c5-77ea-4b5b-97c0-31263c3e5c71", "event_name": "Donald Trump\u2019s China claims roil Panama as Marco Rubio visits", "blurb": "Central American nation in \u2018panic\u2019 as US president issues threats over canal", "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Panama traded on a reputation as a solid US ally and thriving hub for global business \u2014 until US President Donald Trump took office demanding the return of the shipping canal built by the Americans more than a century ago.\n\nNow the Central American nation, whose cultural links with the US include a passion for baseball, is reeling at its portrayal in Washington as a corrupt rogue state in cahoots with Iran and China that seeks to rip off the US at every turn.\n\nCaught in a fierce geopolitical battle, Panama\u2019s predicament offers a taste of what could happen to other nations that have profited from globalisation and hoped to stay neutral, if they fall foul of Washington\u2019s anti-China mood.\n\nUS secretary of state Marco Rubio claimed to a US radio station this week that China could potentially \u201cshut down the Panama Canal\u201d in any conflict.

He has since repeated that threat, including in a post-inauguration speech.\n\nPanama\u2019s conservative pro-business president, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, has described the claims of Chinese military control as \u201cnonsense\u201d, insisted the waterway \u201cis and always will be Panama\u2019s\u201d and signalled a willingness to engage in dialogue \u2014 but nobody in Washington appears to be listening.\n\n\u201cEven as it takes advantage of the global maritime system, Panama has emerged as a bad actor,\u201d Republican senator Ted Cruz said as he opened a committee hearing on the Panama Canal this week. \u201cPanama has for years flagged dozens of vessels in the Iranian \u2018ghost fleet\u2019, which brought Iran tens of billions of dollars in oil profits to fund terror across the world.\u201d\n\nPanama\u2019s government and business elite are beginning to panic, diplomats said, as they realise that although Trump\u2019s rhetoric may be flamboyant, the US president and his allies are serious about pressing their tiny country to make concessions and reduce China\u2019s presence \u2014 even if it means tearing up legally binding agreements.\n\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d one envoy said of Mulino\u2019s government. \u201cThey have been holding nonstop meetings trying to work out what Trump really wants.\u201d\n\nComplicating Panama\u2019s efforts to counter Trump\u2019s accusations is the country\u2019s poor record on corruption and its growing embrace of China after it broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 2017 in order to establish relations with Beijing. It also joined the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\n\nWhen attacking Chinese influence, US critics of Panama have focused on two ports at either end of the canal which are run by Hutchison Ports, an arm of Hong Kong-listed conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings, under long concessions. They were renewed without a bidding process in 2021 for 25 years.\n\nThe broader group rose to prominence before the UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997; it operates 53 ports in 24 countries including the UK and Germany. The ports in Panama have a nearly 40 per cent market share, and the country launched an audit of the licences after Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nAlso in Panama, Chinese state-controlled companies have built a huge convention centre close to the mouth of the canal and are constructing a new bridge over the waterway and a cruise ship port, contracts that were secured through bidding processes. Beijing was seeking to build a big new embassy on land near the canal until US objections killed the scheme.\n\nPanama also planned to negotiate a free trade deal with China this year, though its status is now unclear.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing a divided Washington agrees on, it\u2019s that we\u2019re anti-China,\u201d said a former Trump administration official. \u201cWhat Trump is really saying is that China exerts an undue influence on the canal through operating ports at both ends, and that\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nChina has insisted Panama\u2019s independence is \u201cnot negotiable\u201d and the canal \u201cis not under direct or indirect control by any power\u201d. \u201cWe respect Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and recognise it as a permanently neutral international waterway,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said this month.\n\nAs for Cruz\u2019s Iran accusations, Panama\u2019s maritime authority in 2023 cancelled the registration of 136 Panamanian-flagged vessels after finding they had a \u201cdirect link\u201d to Iran\u2019s national oil company.\n\nTransparency International ranks Panama 108th in the world in its most recent Corruption Perceptions Index, equal with Sierra Leone, and its score has deteriorated recently.\n\nPanamanian officials insist their country has cleaned up its act in recent years, but it spent many years on international blacklists for money laundering and was the centre of the 2016 \u201cPanama Papers\u201d scandal, when a huge data leak from a Panamanian law firm exposed billions of dollars of offshore assets hidden from tax and law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re dealing with is really systematic historic corruption that nobody\u2019s really called out,\u201d Louis Sola, the Trump-appointed chair of the US Federal Maritime Commission, told the Financial Times.\n\nReferring to Tuesday\u2019s senate hearing on Panama, he said: \u201cWe identified very clearly that there\u2019s some sweetheart deals going on\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009As a competition regulator, we have to look at that.\u201d\n\nMulino was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former president Ricardo Martinelli, a billionaire who tapped him as a candidate after he was barred from running again in last year\u2019s election following a money-laundering conviction. Martinelli is sheltering under diplomatic protection in the Nicaraguan embassy in Panama.\n\nTrump\u2019s business has had its own vexed encounter with Panama: the Trump Organization managed a hotel in the country but the arrangement acrimoniously collapsed in 2018, amid a legal dispute, when the owners evicted his company from the building.\n\nUncomfortable in the spotlight and unaccustomed to running campaigns to win hearts and minds in Washington, Panama is not trying to fight a media battle with the US president.\n\nGovernment ministers have been instructed to stay tight-lipped and Mulino\u2019s comments have been limited to saying there will be no negotiation about the ownership of the canal.\n\nInstead, myriad small Panamanian flags have been fixed to posts on major roads in the capital and on some pavements and buildings ahead of Rubio\u2019s visit, in a quiet but determined show of nationalism.\n\n\u201cI think we have made a mistake in thinking that it doesn\u2019t matter what [the Americans] say,\u201d said Tony Fletcher, an executive and former head of Panama\u2019s business lobby Conep who formerly worked at US group Gillette.*\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time to start to set the record straight. We have to do it in writing, with publications, and above all because in this war of disinformation what needs to prevail is well-sourced information.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhy would I be looking at Iran and other countries? My vision has always been completely influenced by America. And my daughter studies in the United States.\u201d\n\n*This story has been amended to correct a name", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e4e3f8ea-f5de-4225-bfe1-fa1fae48f9c9"}}, {"id": "eb108c49-ed5d-43eb-99f5-701c7c9d4699", "event_name": "Maps distort reality while revealing the eternal truth about politics", "blurb": "Trump\u2019s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico is part of a long tradition of deploying cartography in the service of power", "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Well, is it the Gulf of America or the Gulf of Mexico? Is it Mount McKinley or Mount Denali? For Google Maps users, the answer will depend on whether you live in Donald Trump\u2019s America or the rest of the world.\n\nIn complying with Trump\u2019s insistence on renaming the gulf and America\u2019s highest mountain, Google said this week it had \u201ca longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources\u201d.\n\nUsers of the app outside America will continue to see existing names, but this is unlikely to satisfy Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum. Before Trump\u2019s inauguration, she took a swipe at his plans to retitle the gulf. Vast tracts of the US that once formed part of the Spanish empire and later Mexico might be renamed \u201cAm\u00e9rica Mexicana\u201d, she suggested.\n\nGoogle isn\u2019t the first and will assuredly not be the last mapmaker to fall in line with a government\u2019s wishes. Down the centuries, maps have served ideological, imperialistic, religious and cultural purposes more often than impartial scholarship \u2014 as Mark Monmonier, a US geographer, sets out in his book, How to Lie with Maps.\n\nGreat powers have a penchant for maps that express territorial claims or national grandeur. In recent years, China has held a \u201cnational mapping awareness publicity week\u201d, encouraging citizens to think of Taiwan and parts of the maritime zones of nearby Asian countries as Chinese.\n\nIn Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, the government has used anti-extremism laws to clamp down on maps that question whether Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in 2014, or the Kuril Islands, seized from Japan in 1945, belong to Russia.\n\nSmaller countries are just as likely to get in on the act. Since the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia gained independence in 1991, a long-running sore in relations with Greece and Bulgaria has been the use of nationalist maps that include parts of both countries as \u201cGreater Macedonia\u201d.\n\nViktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, promotes maps that show his country with pre-first world war borders, including areas of modern Croatia, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia. Ludovic Orban, Romania\u2019s former premier, once brushed these efforts off with a Romanian proverb \u2014 \u201cthe sparrow dreams of the dough\u201d \u2014 implying Hungary\u2019s leader was indulging in fantasy.\n\nDuring the cold war, even weather forecasts contained political messages. West Germany\u2019s ARD network displayed Germany with pre-second world war frontiers, challenging the communist East German state\u2019s legitimacy.\n\nBefore our times, physical maps published with explanatory texts often betrayed their creators\u2019 assumptions. An 18th-century Japanese map of the world observed of Brazil: \u201cThe inhabitants of this country do not build houses\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009They like to eat human flesh;\u00a0however, they only eat men and not women. Their clothes are made from birds\u2019 feathers.\u201d\n\nIn western countries, our mental picture of the globe remains profoundly influenced by a 1569 map produced by Gerardus Mercator, a Flemish cartographer. In his effort to depict the three-dimensional Earth on a two-dimensional map, Mercator made places far from the equator look relatively larger. This is why Greenland appears about the same size as Africa, though it is not even a tenth as big.\n\nCome to think of it, could Denmark avoid ceding Greenland to the US, as Trump wants, by using maps to flatter his ego? A US-friendly government in Warsaw once proposed naming a Polish military base after the president. That brainwave came to nothing \u2014 meaning the name is free for use. Perhaps Greenland\u2019s capital, Nuuk, known until 1979 as Godth\u00e5b, could be renamed Fort Trump.\n\ntony.barber@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/68d3ba97-18d2-4f4c-8d6b-305040b31c5b"}}, {"id": "ea873671-be97-46bb-818c-6e27250ea51e", "event_name": "DeepSeek will not derail Wall Street\u2019s tech rally, say fund managers", "blurb": "Chinese start-up could reorder winners and losers from AI boom", "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0", "body": "The artificial intelligence-powered rally in US stocks has further to run, say equity investors, although the \u201cwake-up call\u201d from Chinese start-up DeepSeek is likely to reorder the winners and losers from the rapidly evolving technology.\n\nDeepSeek last week unveiled a cutting-edge reasoning model capable of competing with those designed in the US \u2014 but apparently for a fraction of the cost \u2014 sending shockwaves through equities markets and reigniting fears among some investors of a repeat of the dotcom crash at the start of this century.\n\nBy the end of Monday, chipmaker and stock market darling Nvidia had shed almost $600bn \u2014 the biggest one-day loss in US history. A ferocious US tech sell-off spread to energy stocks and utilities that had been expected to benefit from demand for power to fuel AI data centres.\n\nBut since then, the sell-off has run out of steam. US indices ended the week lower, with Nvidia close to its Monday lows. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 1 per cent and 1.6 per cent over the past five sessions.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek isn\u2019t devastating for the overall market. The impact will be far more subtle,\u201d said Alicia Levine, head of investment strategy and equities at BNY Wealth.\n\nShe expects healthcare stocks and other companies with access to massive amounts of data to reap the rewards as investors move into less richly priced areas of the market.\n\n\u201cIf AI becomes cheaper and faster, it makes sense that those companies would see a boost in value,\u201d Levine said. \u201cThe picks and shovels\u201d companies in the energy and infrastructure sectors, which have been among the main beneficiaries of Big Tech\u2019s huge capital expenditure on AI, may suffer most, she added.\n\nMegacap tech stocks, and excitement around the potential of AI, have been the main driver of the US stock market\u2019s strong performance in recent years. Last year the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks were responsible for more than half of the S&P 500\u2019s gain.\n\nHowever, bears fear that DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough could have huge implications for the spending plans and valuations of some of the Silicon Valley giants that have driven that rally, and for the wider, top-heavy US market, where the largest 10 stocks now account for almost two-fifths of the S&P 500.\n\nDeepSeek \u201ctells us there is growing competition and AI may be harder to monetise than assumed\u201d, said\u00a0Robert Almeida, global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management.\n\nHe thinks the Chinese firm represents the start of a new capital cycle, creating \u201cgrowing supply, growing competition, and lower returns\u201d that may threaten the high valuations of the big AI incumbents.\n\nBillionaire investor Ray Dalio told the Financial Times this week that AI hype had fuelled a \u201cbubble\u201d in US equities.\n\nBeyond Nvidia, big losers this week have been chipmaker Broadcom and energy groups GE Vernova and Constellation Energy.\n\nBut many investors and analysts think the sell-off was a blip rather than the start of a fundamental market shift.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [we\u2019re in] a bubble and I don\u2019t think we are about to see a bubble burst,\u201d said Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief global equity strategist.\u00a0Instead, DeepSeek was simply a reminder that the \u201cdominant tech companies are not immune from disruption and competition\u201d.\n\nInvestor appetite for US tech companies appeared undimmed on Thursday, when shares in Tesla and Meta rose after the two companies pledged to pour billions more dollars into building out their AI infrastructure.\n\nSome think DeepSeek\u2019s cheap alternative to OpenAI\u2019s popular ChatGPT app could in fact spur even higher AI spending in the US. Bank analysts\u2019 notes last week talked of the so-called Jevons paradox \u2014 the theory that demand for technology such as AI will surge as it becomes cheaper and more energy efficient, leading to an overall increase in energy use.\n\n\u201cEverybody is [too] negative. [DeepSeek] is not going to change the underlying demand for computing capacity,\u201d said Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at Nvidia shareholder J Stern & Co, citing massive spending commitments made by groups such as Meta.\n\nHe does not believe Nvidia is overvalued, and thinks that rising profits will support the stock price of some Big Tech firms. \u201cYou may not have an increase in the valuation but you will benefit from the growth in earnings, in revenues and in cash flows.\u201d\n\nVenture capitalist Reid Hoffman, billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn and ManasAI, sees DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough as bullish for the wider AI sector.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek isn\u2019t a game-changer for global AI hegemony, but it is a welcome wake-up call that China\u2019s competitive talent is very capable,\u201d he told the FT.\n\n\u201cMany small AI companies in the US use large models to train their smaller models more efficiently. So a quality model like DeepSeek trained using that tactic is a positive signal for what small AI companies in the US can build,\u201d he added.\n\nSome even think this week\u2019s market turmoil could spark a healthy rebalancing for the wider market.\n\nMarko Kolanovic, JPMorgan\u2019s former chief global markets strategist \u2014 who has long warned of the risks to market stability from investors piling into the same handful of stocks and trades \u2014 said Nvidia\u2019s 17 per cent decline on Monday should provide the market with a \u201cshot in the arm\u201d.The past week\u2019s sell-off may trigger a rotation within the tech sector into relative \u201claggards\u201d like Apple, he said. \u201cMaybe [Nvidia] isn\u2019t such a sure bet after all.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Mari Novik and Harriet Agnew in London", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/265ac5a6-531f-4647-be62-8b9c3d74ca54"}}, {"id": "903246d4-799b-4771-95c2-305893adea24", "event_name": "Facebook parent Meta in talks to reincorporate outside Delaware  ", "blurb": "Group is latest tech company to consider move away from longtime American corporate haven ", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "Meta is in discussions to reincorporate outside of Delaware, becoming the latest tech group to study exiting the state that has long been considered an American corporate haven.\n\nThe social media group is weighing moving its legal residence to another state, such as Texas, but has not decided on a destination, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe talks come after Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg earlier this month announced the company would move its US-based trust and safety staff from California to Texas as part of a broad \u2018free speech\u2019 overhaul of its approach to content moderation.\n\nZuckerberg said at the time the shift would help the company \u201cbuild trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams\u201d.\n\nMeta has faced allegations from President Donald Trump and his allies that it censors conservatives and is staffed by liberal-leaning employees, but has recently been attempting to court the new administration.\n\nMeta declined to comment on a possible relocation. However, the group said there was no plan to move its corporate headquarters out of California. The Wall Street Journal first reported on its potential reincorporation.\n\nLast year, Elon Musk won shareholder backing to reincorporate electric-vehicle maker Tesla to Texas, leaving Delaware after a dispute over a lawsuit seeking to block his huge pay package, which has been twice repudiated by the state\u2019s corporate law court.\n\nMusk, the world\u2019s richest man, also reincorporated his social platform X from Delaware to Texas.\n\nDelaware has struggled adjudicating disputes with companies with dominant shareholders or dual-class shares. The state\u2019s corporate law imposes higher legal review standards on these so-called controlled companies.\n\nMeta had faced several fiduciary breach lawsuits in Delaware from minority shareholders including against a share reclassification that would have handed more voting power to Zuckerberg, a move the company abandoned in 2017 prior to a trial.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the S&P 500 is incorporated in Delaware and many venture capital investors demand start-ups make their legal domicile there.\n\nCorporate law observers believed investor protections in the state would force management teams to remain in Delaware. But a large company such as Meta leaving could become a bellwether for further migration.\n\nSeparately on Friday, Dropbox, a cloud storage provider, said its shareholders approved a reincorporation to Nevada from Delaware.

He made his comments shortly before Trump sent his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, to Venezuela on Friday to discuss a deal for the repatriation of the country\u2019s deportees from the US.\n\nChevron has operated in Venezuela for nearly a century, and its licenses to do so have been extended several times \u2014 including by the first Trump administration \u2014 even as the US has grown increasingly impatient with successive authoritarian regimes in Caracas and imposed economic sanctions to punish its leadership.\n\nIn 2022 Joe Biden\u2019s administration granted a licence authorising Chevron to expand its Venezuelan business, in a show of good faith and hope of improving democratic conditions under authoritarian President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Broad sanctions on the country\u2019s oil sector were lifted in October 2023, allowing companies to do business with PDVSA, Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil producer.\n\nBut Maduro backtracked on a promise to allow the opposition to pick its own candidate in the presidential election last July, and the outcome, in which Maduro was declared the winner in a result widely regarded as fraudulent, have prompted critics on both sides of the political aisle to question whether western companies should still continue doing business there.\n\nThe sanctions were reimposed last April, though individual exemption licences, including Chevron\u2019s, were kept in place.\n\nThat licence has enabled Chevron to boost its Venezuelan production to about 200,000 barrels a day.\n\nChevron, the second-biggest western oil company, had net income of $3.2bn in the fourth quarter compared with $2.2bn a year earlier, but adjusted earnings of $2.06 a share were below Wall Street estimates of $2.11. Its shares fell 4.6 per cent on Friday in New York.\n\nThe group, which was a significant donor to Republican candidates in the recent election cycle, according to Open Secrets, used the phrase \u201cGulf of America\u201d in its earnings material instead of Gulf of Mexico, just days after Trump called for the renaming of the body of water.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s opposition, led by Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, has increased calls to cancel Chevron\u2019s licence.\n\nSpeaking to the FT this month, Machado \u2014 who was banned from running in the election \u2014 warned Chevron and other foreign companies against \u201chelping to prop up\u201d Maduro\u2019s government.\n\nRubio has signalled a tougher approach to the country.

So all that needs to be re-explored.\u201d\n\nWhen Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term this month, the outgoing Biden administration, alongside the EU and the UK, announced co-ordinated sanctions on Venezuelan officials, though it stopped short of cancelling the exemption licences.\n\nSome experts play down concerns that Chinese and Russian rivals could fill any gap left by Chevron.\n\nFrancisco Monaldi, a Latin America energy expert at Rice University in Houston, said Chinese and Russian oil companies are unlikely to make a move in Venezuela should Chevron leave.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t done it during the past few years, and particularly since US sanctions have been in place, they have been very cautious,\u201d Monaldi said.\n\nWirth said Chevron was owed a significant amount of money in Venezuela. \u201cLook, we\u2019re running a business. We don\u2019t engage in foreign policy,\u201d he said.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/61c83b8f-6c6f-4200-b389-f186f0a69c75"}}, {"id": "cba31091-d28f-4c8c-86ca-a2a0b454c8dc", "event_name": "Musk is right \u2014 US government badly needs a digital makeover", "blurb": "If he can drive the change that\u2019s required, future generations will thank him", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "Here we go again. In recent years, the entrepreneur Elon Musk has become (in)famous for being so maniacally focused on overhauling entities such as Tesla and X that he has slept in offices and fired employees he considered uncommitted.\n\nNow he wants to do the same at Donald Trump\u2019s White House. This week, 2mn federal employees were asked to resign if they did not want to come into the office (and, by implication, embrace the reforms Musk is hatching at the new Department of Government Efficiency he leads).\n\nThe White House apparently expects 5-10 per cent of staff to take the offer, saving $100bn annually. And to reinforce the message, Musk even dispatched the same \u201cFork-in-the-road\u201d meme used when he fired staff at X. He is reportedly sleeping in the Executive Office of the President, too.\n\nUnions will undoubtedly howl. So will progressives. And Musk\u2019s plans will probably face legal challenges. But even as many observers recoil, quite understandably, from Musk\u2019s brutal style, there is one point that no one should ignore: if Doge can actually unleash digital reform in the US government, and in a non-corrupt manner, that would be an unambiguously good thing.\n\nIndeed, if I had a Musk-focused magic wand, I would wish him to make digital reform, not trolling his critics, Doge\u2019s main priority. Digitising government is not just the key to creating greater efficiency and effectiveness; it could also restore some of the public\u2019s shattered trust in the state.\n\nThe reason for this is that America is bedevilled by a paradox. On the one hand, its private sector is extraordinarily dynamic, and driving much of the 21st-century tech revolution, with its laser-like focus on consumers. But on the other, its government bureaucracy is sclerotic and inefficient, with an antediluvian approach to technology.\n\nSo much so, in fact, that the US does not even feature in the UN\u2019s 2024 list of the 18 most tech-savvy e-governments, ranking well behind countries such as Estonia, Singapore and Denmark, and even Saudi Arabia. That is shocking.\n\nPrevious administrations have tried to change this. In 2014, Barack Obama created the United States Digital Service, in a bid to improve government tech after the botched rollout of his HealthCare.gov initiative. This has had some success. As Deloitte notes, the Inland Revenue Service introduced an automated paper returns-scanning process during the Covid pandemic which enabled it to scan \u201c80 times more returns in the first quarter of 2023 than the whole of 2022\u201d. And during Trump\u2019s first administration, his son-in-law Jared Kushner tried to overhaul electronic record-keeping at the Department of Veterans Affairs (a laudable move that, sadly, had patchy results).\n\nBut reformers have faced big obstacles. One is a government culture of risk aversion, says Brett Goldstein of Vanderbilt University, who previously oversaw the Defense Digital Service at the Pentagon. Another is that federal structures are fragmented and plagued by outdated tech.\n\n\u201cThere are 101 civilian agencies\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and back in 2017 we were spending $60bn a year on [those] and half was on legacy systems,\u201d laments Chris Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the first Trump administration. \u201cNow it is certainly more.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge, outlined in a recent book by Jennifer Pahlka, a Democrat who has fought for tech reform, is that the government typically plans projects in a slow-moving, top-down manner \u2014 unlike the private sector, which uses an iterative, bottom-up, user-focused approach. The consequence is \u201cconcrete boat[s]\u201d, she notes. In other words, projects so heavy they sink.\n\nCan Musk change this? Many techies hope so. \u201cI think Elon is the right person for the job since he has a bottom-up approach and the energy and tenacity to go into the details,\u201d says Goldstein. Or, as Krebs, puts it: \u201cWhat is happening now is much bigger and more intentional than [what we did before].\u201d\n\nAnd there is widespread consensus on what should be done: install a \u201csoftware as a service\u201d mentality into government that focuses on user needs, with a centralised \u201cshare services\u201d model. That could create a co-ordinated procurement process that would slash costs, create a better experience for citizens and improve cyber defence.\n\nMoreover, case studies show how to do this. Canada adopted a shared service approach more than a decade ago, notes Krebs. Estonia, Denmark and Singapore are also good models. And Ukraine offers a particularly inspirational example of how to build apps that provide government services to citizens.\n\nSo will Musk ever succeed in inculcating these non-American lessons? Does he have the tenacity, force and staff for a lengthy cultural fight? We don\u2019t know.\n\nBut one thing, at least, is clear: if Musk does manage to import approaches from places such as Estonia or Singapore \u2014 and in the process create a functioning e-government in the US \u2014 he will deserve praise from Republicans and Democrats alike. So, please, Elon: focus on that, not political posturing. Future generations of Americans will thank you.\n\ngillian.tett@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f9754b26-25fc-4403-8d42-3b12e82cd20f"}}, {"id": "05e347e0-e380-438d-b357-e8e34c697a55", "event_name": "Wise ordered to pay $2.5mn in US for misleading fee advertising", "blurb": "London-listed fintech handed penalty by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for \u2018series of illegal actions\u2019 ", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "London-listed fintech Wise has been ordered to pay nearly $2.5mn by US regulators for \u201ca series of illegal actions\u201d including misleading advertising of its fees.\n\nThe US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday demanded Wise pay a $2mn civil penalty and $450,000 in customer compensation for advertising inaccurate fees and failing to properly disclose exchange rates and other costs.\n\nWise prides itself on offering cheap and quick cross-border payments, without hidden costs.

For siblings James Boulter, a talent agent at United Talent Agency (UTA), and Katie Boulter, Britain\u2019s No 1 female tennis player, passion and perseverance are essential. \u201cIt\u2019s important that I love what I do as I know I\u2019m going to put so much more energy into my everyday life,\u201d says Katie, 28, who at time of writing is ranked 23 in the world (a career high) and has three career titles; she\u00a0first represented Great Britain aged eight, becoming the No 1 ranked\u00a0junior in 2008.\n\n\u201cBoth of us are cognisant that the work we do is a privilege,\u201d says 31-year-old James. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we get out of bed for, that we are excited and want to do, and I think that\u2019s a healthy obsession.\u201d\n\nToday, the siblings are relishing a rare afternoon together in the Chelsea Barracks residential complex, chosen as a location for its spectacular subterranean tennis court adjoined by a plush lounge-style viewing platform. Katie, dressed in an ivory white Stella McCartney suit, and James, in Paul Smith, are two peas in a pod: thoughtful, big-picture thinkers, nimble with quips. As James weighs up the highs and lows of 2024, Katie chips in: \u201cNot spending enough time with me!\u201d\n\nIndeed, each spends an average of 40 weeks a year away from the UK, with Katie competing on the global WTA circuit, and James in LA for awards season from January\u00a0to April, and then on the road to work with clients across the globe \u2013 his roster includes Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas, Jessica Alba, Cardi\u00a0B, Paris Hilton, Patrick Dempsey, Catherine Zeta Jones, Cynthia Erivo and Karlie Kloss. Over his career,\u00a0James has been responsible for securing over $200mn of commercial and\u00a0endorsement opportunities for his clients, and expanding their commercial ventures by securing brand partnerships, negotiating equity deals, licensing and launching new ventures.\n\n\u201cKatie and I are both the products of the people that are around us and the support that we have. The support that I provide to my clients is very much the same. I\u2019m a part of their mechanism,\u201d says James. While his sister is in front of the camera, he works discreetly behind the scenes. \u201cMy highs are attached to my clients\u2019, such as landing a major film role or releasing a new album that performs incredibly well,\u201d he says. It often means \u201cadvising and supporting them on crafting strategy and carefully preparing for the next step\u201d.\n\nLast year was a standout for Katie, who won a prestigious title at the San Diego Open and another one in Nottingham (she also won her first title there in 2023). \u201c2024 has been a lot of what I dreamt about when I wanted to become a tennis player. I wanted to achieve multiple things. One of them was to get my ranking inside the top 50 and then see how far I could go with my potential. I always felt I had it, but I never managed to fully capitalise on it. A lot of people spend their whole career trying to get one title so, for me,\u00a0two titles [in one year] was a massive achievement.\u201d Her next priority is to do well at the Slams \u2013 so far her\u00a0best\u00a0performances have been third rounds at Wimbledon and the US Open in 2023.\n\nShe puts part of her success down to life-work balance, the support of her team, her fianc\u00e9 Alex de Minaur (the Australian-born world No 18 player), family and her new fitness trainer, Matt Little. \u201cMy team pushes me through the tough moments and the good moments. They keep me motivated. It\u2019s never-ending tennis,\u201d she says.\u00a0 The player is appreciated by fans for her generous, smiley\u00a0demeanour on and off the court. She and de Minaur are often seen at each other\u2019s games, cheering each other on. Most days, though, are intense: the training involves two to three hours of practice, plus two gym sessions and recovery time in physio and cryo bath. Downtime is spent exploring the cities they land in. For James, the most important thing is a rest from phone calls and emails. He restores his vintage cars and regularly plays tennis. \u201cIt is great for clearing the mind,\u201d he asserts. \u201cWhat a terrible idea!\u201d jokes Katie.\n\nThe siblings\u2019 discipline and focus was instilled as children growing up in Leicestershire, in a family that rewarded both play and work. Tennis is in the blood. Their mother Susan, a teacher and tennis coach, played the game at county level, as did their maternal grandmother Gill Gartshore, while the siblings\u2019 businessman father David encouraged the duo to go for it and persevere. James was Katie\u2019s main tennis partner and they played regularly at the local court. \u201cHow many times did James get into a bad mood and storm off the court? I can tell you a few times!\u201d laughs Katie, who was driven by the simple challenge of\u00a0beating her older brother. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much how I landed in tennis.\u201d James also followed the family tradition for a time, making it to county level for Leicestershire. \u201cMy mum or grandpa would often take us both to tournaments at the weekends around the country\u2026 however, as Katie would come back with trophy after trophy, it became clear she had something special, and by the age of eight she\u00a0was already representing Great Britain,\u201d he says.\n\nJames\u2019s journey into the entertainment field was circuitous. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody, especially in the UK, tells you that you could be a Hollywood agent. It doesn\u2019t come up in career counselling,\u201d he says. He left school at 18 and first started a packaged-goods health-food business, before moving into\u00a0management consultancy, overseeing brands and interacting with talent. He then took that knowledge into the entertainment world, setting up his own agency in London in 2019. Indian actress and producer Priyanka Chopra Jonas was one of his first signings, entrusted to him by her manager Anjula Acharia.\n\n\u201cI was representing a small set of talent and building their businesses across anything that\u2019s commercial \u2013endorsements, joint ventures, equity deals \u2013 the full scope of anything that is outside of their role as either an actor or musician,\u201d he explains. It led to James joining UTA, one of the largest talent agencies in the world, spearheaded by his mentors, co-head of talent Chris Hart\u00a0and CEO Jeremy Zimmer.\n\nJames and Katie\u2019s professional worlds are aligned and intertwined. Tennis is ever more popular, particularly women\u2019s tennis,\u00a0while sport and fashion are increasingly converging. Katie benefits from hefty sponsorship deals with brands including Nike, Pragnell fine jewellery, Wilson and Lexus, while James masterminds such deals for his clients. He does not represent Katie, with both preferring to preserve their\u00a0sister-brother relationship over business. \u201cThere is a greater convergence between each of those worlds,\u201d he agrees. \u201cThe responsibility is often greater now too:\u00a0talent is global by nature and has to operate and resonate in different territories and still be authentic. We live in an attention economy\u00a0driven by new platforms.\u201d\n\nHe cites a single post by Chopra Jonas for HSBC about the challenges of moving abroad as a southern Asian. \u201cThat one post was watched by around 668 million people, which is over five times the Super Bowl audience, so\u00a0the responsibility to navigate one\u2019s smaller actions, which then inform everything else, is quite huge,\u201d says James. \u201cYour reach across all platforms must be reaching\u00a0half a million,\u201d he nods at Katie.\n\nThe close dynamic between talent and the social media audience has its own drawbacks. For Katie,\u00a0keeping grounded is fundamental, reminding herself of athletes like Jessica Ennis-Hill that she looked up to as a young girl. \u201cI see myself as someone that kids want to look up to. I think every action that I make and the way that I hold myself on the court and off it is vital, because they always pick up on those little things. When I\u2019m having a tough day and I want to crack a racket or scream at something, I always hold back. Being able to control myself and stay classy on court, it\u2019s so important.\u201d\n\nTheir mode of communication is, week to week, through a family WhatsApp group. \u201cWe are good at sharing each other\u2019s little wins as well as the big ones \u2013 but the big wins are pretty evident,\u201d says James. \u201cFor Katie, that\u2019s her performance at a Grand Slam or winning\u00a0a title and, for me,\u00a0it\u2019s a campaign that gets seen\u00a0by billions of people worldwide. We know what each\u00a0of us are doing, so our family chat is used for smaller\u00a0wins and everything in between \u2013 the good, the\u00a0bad, the ugly,\u201d he smiles.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/73b2b864-9873-44c4-bdd6-cc36a3b125cc"}}, {"id": "c9c336ff-b2b8-4cb3-a792-f7d4502a5547", "event_name": "Canada warns Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs could leave US reliant on Venezuela\u2019s oil ", "blurb": "Foreign minister M\u00e9lanie Joly holds meetings in Washington in attempt to avert trade war", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "The US would be forced to buy oil from geopolitical rivals such as Venezuela if it disrupted trade with Canada, Ottawa\u2019s foreign minister has warned.\n\nM\u00e9lanie Joly told the Financial Times the US president\u2019s threat to impose levies of 25 per cent on Canadian imports would hit \u201creal people\u201d if relations between the two countries descended into a trade war.\n\n\u201cWe ship oil at a discount which is, ultimately, refined in Texas.

According to an economic pattern identified by the historian Niall Ferguson, hegemonic powers that spent more on interest than on the military in the past entered a period of geopolitical decline. Is this now the fate of the US?\n\nThe current disarray of American public finances makes us imagine the previously unimaginable: the issuer of the world\u2019s foremost reserve currency being overburdened by public debt. This debt is on track to surpass 160 per cent of GDP by mid-century, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. In the next 10 years, State Street says $2tn annually of net issuance of Treasury debt is expected. Unlike in the 2010s, the Federal Reserve and other price-insensitive buyers, such as foreign central banks, may not be net buyers. Some European sovereigns look similarly exposed. Governments seem to perennially believe that their economies are in a bad spot and need propping up through fiscal stimulus.\n\nAs the era of close-to-zero interest rates is fading into history, the debt service burden will inexorably rise. This will come on top of a secular deceleration of the world economy and thus tax receipts; higher public spending on ageing populations; and rising defence outlays. At the same time, political dysfunction is on the rise, rendering fiscal consolidation a remoter prospect.\n\nThankfully, there are institutions that warn investors of rising sovereign risk: the rating agencies. Or are there? It is fair to question whether the big three agencies \u2014 S&P Global, Moody\u2019s and Fitch \u2014 have become more coy about the risks of rich countries. In contrast, the agencies seem more willing to dish out downgrades to emerging and developing economies.\n\nThis ratings bifurcation became glaringly obvious during the Covid-19 pandemic: the agencies downgraded poor countries left, right and centre, but left advanced economies\u2019 ratings unscathed. Fitch has cut credit ratings on the US, France and the UK in recent years. Moody\u2019s and S&P also downgraded France last year. But the trend is more about a divide.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, the Big Three rating changes for rich sovereigns were more negative than for emerging markets. The net change \u2014 upgrades minus downgrades \u2014 of advanced sovereign ratings was about 1 per cent of the rated portfolio per year, compared with an even higher net-upgrade ratio of 8 per cent for emerging markets.\n\nBut between 2015 and 2024, there have been even more upgrades for rich countries (a net balance of about 3 per cent of the portfolio per year), despite what appear to be weakening fundamentals. In sharp contrast, emerging markets saw a net balance of about 4 per cent of their sovereign portfolio downgraded, a huge swing from the buoyant earlier period.\n\nIn the face of deteriorating public finances in Washington during the pandemic and 10 weeks after a violent mob stormed the Capitol. S&P raised its assessment score of the institutional strength of the US on its 1 to 5 range to its top level of 1. This step in effect averted a downgrade\u00a0as its assessment of the US fiscal performance had deteriorated.\n\nThere is no question that many emerging sovereigns\u2019 creditworthiness has taken a hit during the past decade. The net downgrade pattern seems appropriate. But has the forward-looking creditworthiness of the rich world really improved over the same period? That appears far-fetched. What seems more likely is that the agencies have taken fright after lawsuits and regulatory backlashes following the financial and Eurozone debt crisis.\n\nFor example, the S&P \u2014 the first agency to downgrade the US in 2011 \u2014 had been the subject of particular ire from policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic, from a costly Department of Justice lawsuit to criminal prosecution in Italy.

The unit has been dogged by years of controversy over potential conflicts of interest with the firm\u2019s consulting work.\n\nAnd a scoop: The Trump administration\u2019s embrace of cryptocurrencies is helping fuel a speculative mania that could cause \u201chavoc\u201d when prices collapse, hedge fund Elliott has warned, according to an investor letter seen by the FT.\n\nIn today\u2019s newsletter:\n\nMasayoshi Son has been laying low in recent years, rebuilding the strength of his tech conglomerate SoftBank. DD has missed his often adventurous financial forays.\n\nMasa has been circling the AI craze with relative quiet, but finally he\u2019s within grasp of securing a seat at the table of Silicon Valley\u2019s great investment craze.\n\nSoftBank is in talks to invest as much as $25bn in OpenAI, the darling at the heart of the AI frenzy. The deal would make the Japanese group OpenAI\u2019s biggest financial backer.\n\nThe investment would be part of a bigger funding round of about $40bn at Sam Altman\u2019s company, which would push the ChatGPT-maker\u2019s valuation to $300bn, the FT reported late on Thursday.\n\nMasa\u2019s known for majorly leveraging up his investments (one banker in 2019 said there were \u201clayers of leverage upon leverage\u201d). This cuts two ways: when things turn sideways, they implode. But a good call can lead to massive payouts.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, is Masa buying in at the end of the cycle?\n\nSoftBank\u2019s famous for a few spectacular blow-ups. WeWork\u2019s valuation plummeted after it had to scrap its IPO plan (and then later, filed for bankruptcy). SoftBank\u2019s ties and backing of Greensill Capital also ended in disaster.\n\nSo, for a few years, Masa has kept under the radar, licking his wounds while building up a strong conviction that AI would be the centrepiece of his next great set of investments.\n\nAnd the spigot of massive tech investments has once again opened up, coaxing him to make a big dice roll.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s one of just four investors who have pledged a total of $100bn to fund Stargate, a major new data centre project unveiled last week. (Others backing the project touted by President Donald Trump include Oracle, Abu Dhabi state fund MGX and OpenAI.)\n\nThe ties between OpenAI and SoftBank are multiplying quickly. The new potential $25bn investment would cover the latter\u2019s commitment to the US infrastructure project, according to several people familiar with the plans.\n\nWhen it comes to bets on AI, Masa has had some good luck so far. His investment in Arm \u2014 of which SoftBank\u2019s still the majority shareholder \u2014 has made him a fortune, with the stock trebling since going public.\n\nThis has given him a new stockpile of assets to leverage in every which way to seed his bets. Such firepower has historically become a fount of entertainment for Wall Street, or just good drama.\n\nPlease join DD in pulling up a seat with some popcorn and a stiff drink in hand, because our boy\u2019s officially back.\n\nJust before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, the scion of Italy\u2019s billionaire Agnelli family John Elkann joined a swelling list of high-powered executives to visit the returning US president.\n\nAs ever with Trump, a deal was on the cards. Days later, the Dodge and Jeep maker Stellantis, which Elkann chairs, committed to invest $5bn across its US car factories.\n\nThe move is part of Elkann\u2019s plan to turn around the struggling carmaker, after the company parted ways with charismatic but uncompromising chief executive Carlos Tavares last month.\n\nStellantis\u2019s share price has cratered in the past year as it has struggled with a shortfall in demand for its cars. Tavares\u2019s unrelenting style also damaged relations, not least with US dealers saddled with high-priced vehicles they were unable to shift.\n\nSince Tavares\u2019s departure, Elkann has jetted across Europe to improve relations with the leaders of Italy, France and the EU, cancelled lay-offs in the US and refreshed Stellantis\u2019s management teams.\n\nHis visit to Trump may prove the most important step yet in his strategic reset.\n\nBeyond the $5bn investment, Elkann is betting that he can use Trump\u2019s EV scepticism and deregulation push to Stellantis\u2019s advantage.\n\nHe told Trump he would back the new administration\u2019s shift away from Joe Biden\u2019s EV targets. The carmaker will launch a number of new models in 2025, across hybrid, electric and petrol formats.\n\nWhile Elkann may have won Trump\u2019s favour, there are challenges ahead. The company continues to supply the US from Canada and Mexico, who are both threatened with tariffs.\n\nAnd whoever Elkann chooses as Stellantis\u2019s next chief executive will face the same challenges as the rest of the car industry: increasing competition from China and a long-term slowdown in new car sales.\n\nBlackstone, the world\u2019s largest alternative manager, is flexing its muscles again after enduring a test when interest rates soared in 2022, causing many investors to sell their investments in its massive property fund, Breit.\n\nIt\u2019s on the offensive again after raising $171bn and investing $134bn in 2024, not far off the New York-based group\u2019s activity in 2021 when chief executive Stephen Schwarzman professed an \u201cout of body experience\u201d as cash sloshed around freely.\n\nIn its fourth-quarter results, Blackstone\u2019s relatively nascent infrastructure business emerged as a driver of better than expected returns.\n\nIts $43bn perpetual infrastructure fund soared about 20 per cent for the year, lifting its fee-related performance revenues by $1.2bn, or 728 per cent, from the same time in 2023.\n\nAt the helm of Blackstone\u2019s infrastructure unit is a rising star inside the group who was name-checked by Schwarzman in front of shareholders on Thursday.\n\nIn 2017, Sean Klimczak was tasked with getting Blackstone on the map in infrastructure, an area where non-US groups such as Brookfield, Macquarie and EQT dominate. The efforts didn\u2019t start off swimmingly \u2014 a Saudi Arabia-backed effort initially stalled.\n\nMeanwhile, independent infrastructure investment outfits including Global Infrastructure Partners and Stonepeak, which had been spun out of Blackstone, had their assets soar.\n\nBut Blackstone\u2019s now collected $55bn in infrastructure assets and believes it has positioned itself to be a major player. It has been bolstered by winning investments such as gas export pioneer Cheniere Energy Partners and data centre operator QTS.\n\nSchwarzman said the toils of building businesses internally carry \u201csignificant economic benefits as compared to a strategy of bolt-on acquisitions\u201d, an apparent reference to a wave of infrastructure-related deals such as BlackRock\u2019s $12.5bn takeover of GIP last year.\n\nSpace lasers Donald Trump has ordered work on a defence shield that goes beyond Ronald Reagan\u2019s famed \u201cStar Wars\u201d programme, the FT reports.\n\nDeutsche\u2019s woes For much of the past 15 years, the only thing consistent about Deutsche Bank was its ability to step on every rake it encountered, Lex writes.

The Bombardier CRJ700 jet was making its approach into Washington Reagan National Airport when it collided with a US army Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk helicopter, plunging into the Potomac River.\n\nThe fuselage of the commercial jet was found in three pieces in the water. The American flight had 60 passengers and four crew members on board, while three soldiers were in the Black Hawk.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board said it would have a preliminary report in 30 days. The agency late on Thursday said it had recovered the voice and data recorders from the jet, though the helicopter\u2019s were still in the water.\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s speculation regarding the cause of the crash, Jennifer Homendy, the agency\u2019s chair, earlier on Thursday said: \u201cWe do not know enough facts to be able to rule in or out human factor, mechanical factors.\u201d\n\nTrump, who was flanked by his vice-president and newly sworn-in secretaries of defence and transportation, began his remarks with an appeal for unity in \u201ca moment of anguish\u201d, when \u201cthe differences between Americans fade to nothing\u201d.\n\nBut he quickly launched into a political attack against Democrats, saying that ex-presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had lowered standards for who was allowed to qualify to be an air traffic controller.\n\n\u201cI put safety first, Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and their politics was even worse.\u201d\n\nHe said that \u201cfor an air traffic controller, we want the brightest, the smartest, the sharpest.

It was very clear night\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the American Airlines plane had lights blazing,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cI have helicopters. You can stop a helicopter very quickly. It had the ability to go up or down, had the ability to turn, and the turn it made was not the correct one,\u201d he added.\n\nUS defence officials said the Black Hawk was being flown by an experienced crew on routine training.\n\nTrump said investigators were trying to determine whether the troops were using night vision equipment, which \u201cmay change your view\u201d from the cockpit. A defence official said the army could not confirm whether the crew was wearing the night vision goggles.\n\nDefence secretary Pete Hegseth said the three soldiers in the helicopter \u201cwere on a routine annual night flight retraining on a standard corridor for a continuity of government mission\u201d.\n\n\u201cTragically, last night, a mistake was made\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009there was some sort of an elevation issue that we have immediately begun investigating at the DoD and army level,\u201d he said, adding that what happened was \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d.\n\nUS Army aviation expert John Koziol said that given the flight crew\u2019s experience, \u201cthis should not have been a problem knowing exactly where they were at\u201d.\n\nHe called the corridor \u201crelatively easy to fly\u201d and said the helicopter\u2019s route was flown on a near daily basis by army and other government aircraft.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, officials said 28 bodies had been recovered from the American flight and one body from the Black Hawk.\n\nTrump said Russian citizens were aboard the flight and the US would facilitate the repatriation of their bodies. There has been no direct air travel between the US and Russia since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSerious aviation accidents are rare in the US.

Jay Powell and his fellow central bank officials held interest rates steady, defying pressure from Donald Trump to slash borrowing costs.\n\nThe Fed kept its benchmark rate between 4.25 and 4.5 per cent and signalled it wouldn\u2019t be moving anytime soon: Powell said that rate-setters \u201cdo not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance\u201d.\n\nTrump was quick to express his displeasure with the decision and derided the central bank, which operates independently. He blamed Powell for inflation and said the Fed was too focused on diversity, equity and inclusion instead of high prices.\n\n\u201cBecause Jay Powell and the Fed failed to stop the problem they created with Inflation, I will do it by unleashing American Energy production, slashing Regulation, rebalancing International Trade, and reigniting American Manufacturing,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social soon after the rate announcement.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed had spent less time on DEI, gender ideology, \u2018green\u2019 energy, and fake climate change, Inflation would never have been a problem. Instead, we suffered from the worst Inflation in the History of our Country!\u201d\n\nPowell, however, refused to react to Trump\u2019s demands. During his press conference yesterday he stated that he was \u201cnot going to have any response or comment on what the president said\u201d. The new administration\u2019s policies were \u201cnot for us to criticise, or to praise\u201d, he added.\n\nCornell University professor Eswar Prasad told the FT\u2019s Claire Jones that this rate decision \u201cwill cue the political pressure\u201d, adding:\n\nTrump wants to destroy nuclear missiles with space lasers [free to read].\n\nHe made the proposal as part of an executive order that tasks his new defence secretary Pete Hegseth with coming up with a plan, in the next 60 days, to defend the US against missile attacks.\n\nTrump\u2019s idea includes building an air defence system over the US that he\u2019s dubbed the \u201cIron Dome for America\u201d, in a nod to Israel\u2019s renowned missile shield. But what he actually has in mind is more akin to Ronald Reagan\u2019s so-called Star Wars programme, launched in 1983 at the height of the cold war.\n\nThis Star Wars 2.0 fantasy would cost hundreds of billions of dollars \u2014 and face immense technological challenges. It also could provoke China and Russia to take countermeasures that would cancel out its effects.\n\nAnalysts say that a leakproof, space-based missile shield is all but impossible. \u201cThere is no magical security blanket,\u201d said Tom Karako, a leading missile expert at the CSIS think-tank in Washington.\n\nPlus, \u201cone cannot put active defences everywhere that would be needed to defend cities, critical infrastructure and military sites\u201d, Stacie Pettyjohn, of the Center for a New American Security think-tank, told me.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Iron Dome defends only small areas from short-range, low-flying and non-nuclear missiles. Trump\u2019s version seeks to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles that travel 100 times further and seven times faster. (The US is almost 450 times bigger than Israel.)\n\nHe wants it to deploy \u201cspace-based interceptors\u201d \u2014 a web of satellites, some equipped with lasers. But detecting, intercepting and destroying ballistic nuclear missiles during the three- to five-minute period before they enter orbit, would require laser beams effective over hundreds of kilometres.\n\nTechnology like that simply doesn\u2019t exist.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b5a32a95-d1c4-44d3-895a-ce9b4027c26c"}}, {"id": "728c8c04-a84f-4551-a0c2-55a9c2c71d38", "event_name": "Donald Trump\u2019s administrative self-coup", "blurb": "A constitutional crisis looms after attempt to wrest power of the purse from Congress ", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "Greetings. Last week I asked for your ideas of possible \u201cgrey swans\u201d of Trumponomics 2.0, and you didn\u2019t disappoint. Your worries included huge costs from new pandemics, a \u201cwild spree of violence and revenge led by the just-pardoned criminals\u201d, Donald Trump\u2019s deteriorating mental health leading to him being replaced by JD Vance, an actual military grab for Greenland, and peace in Ukraine, the Middle East, or both. Oh, and a credit crisis for the US government.\n\nAll are huge but conceivable events, and the repercussions would be incalculable. But nobody \u2014 me included \u2014 predicted the sudden stops in government spending that have taken place since last week. Today\u2019s column offers some thoughts on that.\n\nWhen I say sudden, I mean sudden. First, Trump signed an executive order suspending all development aid for 90 days, with reviews determining what spending should be reinstated. Then the Office of Management and Budget announced an indefinite freeze on all federal grants and financial aid, with the exception of Medicare, social security and aid directly to individuals \u2014 but including all aid given through states, NGOs and so on. Naturally, chaos ensued, to the point where the administration U-turned, cancelling the across-the-board domestic grant freeze while pointedly reasserting the intention of aligning spending with Trump\u2019s Maga agenda.\n\nThe original sweeping instruction on federal spending was imprecise, got the numbers wrong (it said the federal government spent \u201cnearly $10tn\u201d in the 2024 fiscal year, while the true number is $6.75tn), and was wildly ideological. Here are some excerpts from the OMB\u2019s memo:\n\nDon\u2019t let the over-the-top silliness or the U-turn distract from the enormity of what was attempted. First, in sheer economic terms, chaos was guaranteed. Steve Bannon\u2019s call from eight years ago for a \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d is back on.\n\nAlready the foreign aid freeze (which remains in force, as far as I can tell) seems to have stopped a lot of programmes in their tracks, with many development agency staff apparently ordered to stop working. And hardly any work in international development will be unaffected, since the US is the rich world\u2019s largest donor of development aid \u2014 largely as a function of its huge economic size; it\u2019s near the bottom of the list on a per capita basis. (Secretary of state Marco Rubio has now also approved some exceptions from the foreign aid freeze for some humanitarian assistance.)\n\nThe effects of the domestic financial assistance \u201cpause\u201d were bigger and more chaotic still. Medicaid \u2014 providing the healthcare of nearly one-fifth of Americans \u2014 seems to have been affected. I am told universities and health research bodies were thrown into disarray. A federal judge immediately blocked part of the order. But the uncertainty remains, beyond the possible economic fallout.\n\nFor the second type of chaos that the Trump White House has plunged the nation into is a legal and constitutional crisis, and one that more of us should frankly have seen coming. Back in November, Matt Glassman of Georgetown University warned against \u201cpotentially the biggest executive threat to the separation of powers of them all\u201d. He was talking about violating the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, which makes it illegal for the president to simply refuse to spend money that Congress has appropriated. Shortly after the election, the newly announced heads of the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, wrote in the Wall Street Journal that Trump regarded the act as unconstitutional. There is no reason to see this week\u2019s backtracking as a change of mind, rather than a mere tactical retreat.\n\nThe federal spending freeze was, in other words, the opening salvo of a huge constitutional battle over the separation and balance of legal power in the US, in which Trump and his team are aiming to shift as much power from the legislative to the executive branch of government. That is of a piece with their support for the \u201cunitary executive\u201d theory which rejects limits on the president\u2019s authority over the entire executive branch.\n\nThird, and most important, is the political significance. A shift of power from the legislature to the executive, and a concentration of executive power in the president \u2014 what does that look like to you? I was struck by one sentence in the OMB memo in particular:\n\n\u201cCareer and political appointees in the Executive Branch have a duty to align Federal spending and action with the will of the American people as expressed through Presidential priorities.\u201d It also directed federal agencies to put political appointees in charge of ensuring that grants \u201cconform to Administration priorities\u201d.\n\nWhat if \u201cadministration priorities\u201d run counter to congressional ones? This conflict arises automatically in this case, where the presidential priority is not to spend money Congress has decided to spend. The memo could not be clearer about the answer: the will of the people is expressed through presidential priorities \u2014 not, then, those of the elected houses of Congress. The rule, in short, of one man.\n\nThe OMB memo did, to be fair, include this qualifier: \u201cto the extent permissible under applicable law\u201d. That extent will now be tested, and fought over, perhaps to destruction. For the stakes can hardly be exaggerated. This assault on both Congress\u2019s power of the purse and on the US\u2019s administrative state is as much of a self-coup as was the spurring of insurrectionists on January 6 2021.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a221a10a-5ac2-47b6-ba8b-30e18553c181"}}, {"id": "65e479db-914f-4f94-b7ec-a7ad7bb07da3", "event_name": "The political cult of the entrepreneur", "blurb": "Is what\u2019s good for America\u2019s richest men also good for America?", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "In our era, the meaning of any image depends which side you\u2019re on. Take the photograph of Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai sitting in front of cabinet members at Donald Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Caricature liberal elitists, like me, saw it as a portrait of American oligarchy. Trump, his supporters and the tech moguls themselves interpret the picture differently.\n\nTrump, a master of spectacle, put the billionaires there for a reason. His message: \u201cI\u2019ve brought them to heel and harnessed them to the American project.\u201d He knows most of his voters will approve. Maga is built more on the cult of the entrepreneur than on the cult of the strongman, though they overlap. Many businesspeople regard great entrepreneurs as the winners of life\u2019s game.\n\nTrump built his reputation playing a great entrepreneur on TV. He then went into politics selling the notion that government was a \u201cmalfunctioning corporation called the USA\u201d, to quote Gordon Gekko\u2019s \u201cGreed is good\u201d speech from the 1987 movie Wall Street. Trump promised to run government like a business. The Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris election was, among countless contrasts, entrepreneur against government official.\n\nTrumpism may represent the peak of the political cult of entrepreneurs. I can\u2019t think of another entrepreneur becoming head of government in a major economy, except Silvio Berlusconi. Past US political cults were attached to soldiers (Washington, Eisenhower) or to corporate bosses, such as Mitt Romney. George W Bush, who had a Harvard MBA, was hailed as a \u201cCEO president\u201d. But the corporate CEO is a rule-bound figure in a suit with degrees. The entrepreneur is a wilder beast, autonomous, rule-breaking, often a college dropout. He\u2019s his own man. (This is a male cult \u2014 recall Zuckerberg\u2019s recent praise of \u201cmasculine energy\u201d.)\n\nThe biggest entrepreneurial fortunes in history were coined in Silicon Valley between about 1998 and 2008. Today, the beneficiaries are middle aged. Their 80-hour workweeks are mostly over, leaving them with enough energy to pour into politics. They are known to ordinary Americans by their first names or nicknames, in Musk\u2019s case by his tweets, and by their anti-corporate dress. The billionaires relentlessly self-brand as iconoclasts, which can go wrong, as perhaps with Musk\u2019s apparent Nazi salute.\n\nUnderpinning the cult is the belief that what\u2019s good for entrepreneurs is good for America. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen told podcaster Joe Rogan that Trump\u2019s message, \u201cAmerica has to win\u201d, meant that US companies \u201cshould win global markets\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009How can anybody be against that?\u201d After all, Andreessen argued, only economic growth could pay for \u201cwelfare programmes and food assistance programmes, all these things\u201d.\n\nThe argument is dubious. First, Europeans retire earlier and live longer than Americans, despite lower economic growth and mostly lower governmental debt-to-GDP ratios. Second, growth doesn\u2019t necessarily boost public spending given that Big Tech has perfected tax avoidance. Nor do these companies create many jobs. Meta has 72,000 mostly high-skilled employees, including immigrants on H1-B visas.\n\nLast, how do the moguls \u2014 who spent decades ignoring Washington \u2014 read that photograph? In Andreessen\u2019s telling, Joe Biden forced them into Trump\u2019s arms. Whereas most ordinary Americans seem to have experienced Bidenism as a time of inflation and drift, the moguls saw something more sinister: a business-hating administration stamping out their freedoms. Andreessen accuses the Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission of \u201ctrying to kill the crypto industry\u201d.\n\nCrypto and AI are the entrepreneurs\u2019 new battlefields. One difference between Trump I and Trump II is that the price of bitcoin was $900 in 2016 and is more than $100,000 today, while we saw on Monday that shifts in AI can now turn global stock markets.\n\nOn crypto and AI, as on everything else, America is divided. Democrats are wary of crypto as a money-laundering opportunity. Trumpists see it as a libertarian business that subverts government (albeit that crypto entrepreneurs want bank accounts and Trump\u2019s support). Biden tried to regulate AI; Trump won\u2019t. Tech moguls hope he\u2019ll help them win what Peter Thiel calls the \u201cglobal war\u201d to conquer enemy territories such as the EU, the UK and Brazil.\n\nBillionaires care about policies, but they want love too. Several, like Andreessen, used to lean liberal. But if liberals reject you, you\u2019ll choose the guy who loves you (for now) and shows it with his seating plan.\n\nEmail Simon at simon.kuper@ft.com\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend Magazine on X and FT Weekend on Instagram", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/bcb6adce-ac7a-4494-a837-d367ea873ccc"}}, {"id": "a2c5a66e-5618-446b-9cd5-b33b80d6b96e", "event_name": "Donald Trump\u2019s foreign aid freeze sparks global funding crisis", "blurb": "Dramatic repercussions have exposed reach of US assistance and soft power tools disparaged by the president", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "With Colombian anti-narcotrafficking helicopters idle for want of fuel and news outlets in Ukraine threatened by closure, aid organisations and governments around the world are frantically trying to understand how the abrupt freeze of US foreign aid will affect their activities.\n\nThe 90-day suspension of US aid and \u201cstop-work\u201d requirement following US President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order last week has exposed with lightning-like intensity the global reach of US assistance, whose diverse projects worldwide have been an essential part of American soft power.\n\nThe new stance on foreign assistance could threaten that goodwill by putting countries on notice that there was no longer a \u201cdistinction between allies, partners and enemies\u201d, said Gyude Moore, a former Liberian public works minister and fellow at the Center for Global Development, a Washington think-tank. \u201cIt crystallises this idea that any engagement with the US is transactional.\u201d\n\nAfter a global outcry, Marco Rubio, US secretary of state, clarified on Tuesday that \u201ccore life-saving programmes\u201d related to medicine, food and shelter would be exempt from the suspension. Still, humanitarian organisations around the world were left trying to figure out how they would be affected. Yet more international programmes were threatened by Trump\u2019s shortlived federal budget suspension, which was scrapped on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged to hear that there is a waiver process for life saving programmes, but remain concerned that this could get caught up in bureaucratic red tape,\u201d said Elizabeth Hoffman, North America executive director at One, an organisation that campaigns for financing and debt relief for poor countries.\n\nBeatriz Grinsztejn, International Aids Society president, highlighted the threat to the US-backed President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, which has invested more than $110bn in HIV treatment since 2003 and is credited with saving millions of lives in Africa and elsewhere. \u201cPEPFAR provides life-saving antiretrovirals for more than 20mn people,\u201d she said. If funding is cut, \u201cpeople are going to die and HIV will resurge\u201d.\n\nThe State Department has not provided additional guidance since Rubio loosened some restrictions, according to a US official and the head of a humanitarian organisation. Many organisations had already received stop work orders and have implemented them absent\u00a0the additional information, rendering the waiver useless at this point, they said.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order questioned the rationale of much US assistance, which amounted to $64.7bn in 2023, according to ONE, more than a quarter of the $223bn provided by rich countries in that year.\n\nAccording to Trump\u2019s executive order, much US spending was \u201cantithetical to American values\u201d. Tammy Bruce, a state department spokeswoman, said the US was \u201cno longer going to blindly dole out money with no return for the American people\u201d.\n\nThe threat of abrupt withdrawal of swaths of US aid, even once the temporary ban is lifted, has also underlined the historic difference between Washington\u2019s assistance, with its emphasis on grants for health, development and human rights, and that of Beijing, whose main focus has been on loans for Chinese-built infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe rely heavily on the US for our funding and it is a very big headache,\u201d said an adviser to the government in Sierra Leone in west Africa, where US-funded Mpox monitoring and HIV testing immediately stopped following Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\n\u201cThe best-case scenario is to get funding elsewhere,\u201d said the adviser, part of whose salary is paid for by US aid, but indicated that China is unlikely to step fully into the breach.\n\nAmong the programmes immediately threatened, said officials, were relief efforts in Sudan, where nearly two years of civil war has unleashed arguably the world\u2019s worst humanitarian catastrophe, with about half the 49mn population on the verge of famine.\n\nAmjed Farid, a former special adviser to the civilian government, said vital communal kitchens relied exclusively on donor support.\n\n\u201cThe freeze on US funding now threatens to leave millions of Sudanese vulnerable to further suffering, starvation, and inadequate medical care,\u201d he said, although it was unclear whether Rubio\u2019s waiver might save such programmes.\n\nIn Ukraine, the world\u2019s biggest recipient of international assistance since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022, USAID has provided $2.6bn in humanitarian aid, $5bn in development assistance and more than $30bn in direct budget support.\n\nAlthough President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that US military assistance had not been stopped, dozens of Ukrainian entities, including news outlets, medical facilities and veterans organisations, have reported receiving \u201cstop work\u201d orders.\n\nMediarukh, a coalition of news outlets and watchdogs, said in a statement that the freeze would have an impact on the country\u2019s information space, which Russia has exploited during its war. \u201cIndependent Ukrainian media is one of the key elements that distinguishes us from [Vladimir] Putin\u2019s Russia,\u201d it said.\n\nColombia, which was due to receive about $380mn this year in development and counternarcotics funding, has been hit by the spending freeze.\n\nThe country has hosted around 2.8mn Venezuelan migrants, according to the International Organization for Migration, with many NGOs that provide shelter, food, and orientation now unable to pay for their operations.\n\n\u201cAll project activities associated with these sources of funding have been suspended,\u201d said an international NGO worker.\n\nEven several Colombian police operations financed by the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs were put on ice during Trump\u2019s separate federal budget suspension, which was later dropped. \u201cNarcotics, wildlife trafficking, flora trafficking, illegal mining, hydrocarbons, everything [was] affected,\u201d said the official.\n\nAid officials sought to present their programmes \u2014 whether in early-warning systems for the next pandemic or countering terrorism through youth projects \u2014 as contributing to US security in line with Trump\u2019s new \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy.\n\n\u201cPEPFAR is not just a global health programme, it\u2019s a cornerstone of US national security, protecting Americans from emerging health threats,\u201d said Hoffman of the One Campaign. \u201cOur adversaries will capitalise on this gap in US leadership and promote disinformation which will undermine trust in the US and damage our reputation around the world.\u201d\n\nIn Afghanistan, where\u00a0the US is the\u00a0largest humanitarian donor, the cuts threatened help for the women who have been erased from public life since the Taliban took over, especially young girls who still have some access to primary education.\n\nIn the long run, more threatened still may be programmes seen to run counter to Trump\u2019s orders to \u201cend \u2018wokeness\u2019\u201d and to stop the use of US taxpayer money to fund what the Office of Management and Budget called \u201cMarxist equity, transgenderism and green new deal social engineering\u201d.\n\nIn Lebanon, Bechara Samneh, a board member at Mosaic, which provides psychosocial support to LGBT+ people \u2014 among the few active organisations providing such a service \u2014 said it had long relied on foreign donors because of local unwillingness to fund the group.\n\nDuring the recent war, Mosaic provided shelter and emergency services for 400 displaced LGBT+ people. \u201cWhat does it mean for the LGBTQI+ community on the ground?\u201d Samneh said. \u201cIt means no services, no support, no emergency, no protection.\u201d\n\nStill, some policy advocates argued that, however unwelcome the prospective cuts were, they served as a reminder that many health and welfare systems overly depended on foreign aid.\n\n\u201cOur governments now know that help is coming from nowhere,\u201d said Ayoade Alakija, a global health specialist from Nigeria. \u201cThey need to start funding things themselves and investing in their own health and education.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Andres Schipani in New Delhi, Malaika Kanaaneh Tapper in Beirut and Felicia Schwartz in Washington\n\nData visualisation by Clara Murray", "region_codes":

put \u20ac862mn behind its goal to be a major player in lunar exploration, awarding a contract to Thales Alenia Space to build its first cargo vehicle for the Moon.\n\nDaniel Neuenschwander, the ESA\u2019s head of human and robotic exploration, said the deal to begin developing and building the robotic Argonaut lunar lander marked a major milestone in Europe\u2019s strategy to secure greater autonomy in space.\n\nIt comes as Europe prepares for possible changes to US space policy under President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIf Europe wants to play a substantial role in lunar exploration, it has to come with its own capabilities,\u201d Neuenschwander told the Financial Times. \u201cThe Argonaut is really Europe\u2019s autonomous and versatile access to the Moon.\u201d\n\nThe contract is also a big win for Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture that is 67 per cent owned by France\u2019s Thales and 33 per cent by Italy\u2019s Leonardo.\n\nThales Alenia Space fought off competition from Airbus to build the lunar descent element of the lander \u2014 in essence a space truck designed to carry 1.5 metric tonnes of cargo to the Moon.\n\nGermany\u2019s OHB will provide navigation control and communication elements.\n\nArgonaut is due to fly its first mission in about 2031, and is expected to carry cargo to the Moon roughly every two years after that.\n\nThe first mission, which is under discussion now, could involve delivery of navigation and telecommunication payloads, or energy generation and storage systems.\n\nArgonaut is meant not just to enhance Europe\u2019s independence in lunar exploration, but to take advantage of Nasa\u2019s flagship Artemis programme, which aims to land humans on the Moon by 2027.\n\nThe win \u201cmeans a lot to the company\u201d, Thales Alenia Space chief executive Herv\u00e9 Derrey said.\n\nFor Europe, he added, \u201cit can be seen as a precursor to a growing and improving technological capability, offering an important asset for transporting experiments and materials in support of lunar exploration missions\u201d.\n\nThales Alenia Space\u2019s facility in Turin has a long history of building space modules.\n\nIt has manufactured nearly half of the pressurised modules for the International Space Station, and is a key supplier on US and European space programmes.\n\nDerrey said exploration was \u201ca big growing market\u201d for his business. Thales Alenia Space in 2023 generated annual revenues of \u20ac2.2bn.\n\nThe Argonaut contract win is also good news for the joint venture\u2019s owners, who are contemplating a consolidation of certain space assets with Airbus amid a downturn in the market for big communication satellites.\n\nThe exploration market is booming partly because of rising global interest in putting humans on the Moon again, and potentially on Mars.\n\nNasa has encouraged significant private sector involvement in the Artemis programme to help cut exploration costs.\n\nOfficials at Nasa have repeatedly insisted the development of a so-called lunar economy will be key to ensuring the success of future exploration efforts, including a permanent human presence on the Moon.\n\nSeveral companies across the world are developing lunar landers to carry crew and cargo to the Moon as a result.\n\nAnalysys Mason, the space consultancy, estimated in its lunar market report published last summer that Moon missions between 2023 and 2033 could generate $151bn in revenues, three-quarters of which will be from government customers. Infrastructure and transport revenues were expected to account for roughly 43 per cent of that sum.\n\nNeuenschwander said the prime driver for the European lunar lander was to ensure autonomy and strengthen Europe\u2019s value as a partner.\n\nHowever, the lander would have to be competitive and, eventually, Argonaut would evolve to be reusable, he added.\n\nDerrey said landers carrying cargo to the Moon was an area where Europe could develop an advantage \u201cas no one has demonstrated the capability to safely land on the Moon for this particular need until now\u201d.\n\n\u201cEurope and European industries have all the technological capabilities required to compete in the lunar landing market,\u201d he added.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3963920e-afd7-407b-93e7-7a682917a234"}}, {"id": "3cf4e148-4a64-466c-96ab-72e8cc5abfe2", "event_name": "Monetary policy is a sideshow now", "blurb": "And day three of DeepSeekWeek", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning. OpenAI says it has found evidence that its proprietary model was used to train DeepSeek\u2019s revolutionary R1. But in the US-China artificial intelligence competition, do intellectual property rules apply? Should they? Unhedged doesn\u2019t remember there being much fuss about terms of service agreements during the Manhattan project or the space race. And, for the future of humanity, AI is supposed to be more important than either of those. Send us your thoughts: robert.armstrong@ft.com and aiden.reiter@ft.com.\n\nThe Federal Reserve held rates steady today \u2014 as expected \u2014 officially bringing its cutting cycle to a pause. At first, the wording of the official statement made it seem like the Fed\u2019s posture was more hawkish than the market expected. In December, the statement read \u201cinflation has made progress towards the committee\u2019s 2 per cent objective but remains elevated\u201d. This time, the statement omitted the \u201cprogress\u201d part. Yields on the two-year Treasury rose briefly:\n\nThey fell shortly after, when chair Jay Powell dismissed the wording concern and emphasised that the central bank thinks policy is sufficiently restrictive, and inflation should continue to fall.\n\nOther than that moment of miscommunication, it was a boring press conference. Powell did not give much on the big questions of the day \u2014 tariffs, immigration, tax, and quantitative tightening. The dullness reflected the fact that monetary policy has become less important as we inch closer to the inflation target.\n\nDonald Trump has been breathing down the Fed\u2019s neck. At Davos, the president said he would \u201cdemand that interest rates drop immediately\u201d. After yesterday\u2019s meeting, he posted the following on Truth Social:\n\nBeneath the invective, there might be a concession to reality here. Demanding the Fed cuts rates is self-defeating at best, and the Davos demand was not repeated. If Trump wants to change the rate environment, keep inflation low, or increase growth, he\u2019ll have to use other tools. The ball is squarely in his court.\n\nThe Fed has every reason to do nothing. The jobs market is healthy, the economy is growing, we just got two sideways inflation readings, and it seems like there is enough liquidity in the system for quantitative tightening to continue. Policy should remain where it is until more good inflation news comes in, or until the employment numbers show signs of weakness.\n\nMeanwhile, we know nothing about Trump\u2019s economic policy plans beyond some broad priorities, a few provocative actions, and a lot of hot rhetoric. Even if the Fed is starting to look at the risks posed by tariffs and deportations, as Powell has hinted it is, the strong economy means the central bank can afford to keep quiet and wait to see what develops. The same cannot be said of other central banks. The Bank of Canada cut rates earlier today and paused its quantitative tightening. Though tariffs were not the sole reason for the cut, governor Tiff Macklem was not shy about the potential impacts of Trump\u2019s trade policies. He spent most of his conference discussing how the BoC was factoring tariffs into its forecasts and preparing to help counter the negative impacts. That the BoC is more forthcoming is part politics, and part economic fundamentals: tariffs, in any form, will hurt Canada much more than the US.\n\nFiscal policy and monetary policy are always vying for top spot on the market\u2019s list of concerns. For now, there is little to see at the Fed. What the market needs is clarity on the fiscal front.\n\n(Reiter)\n\nOne occupational hazard of being a market analyst are the periodic, acutely uncomfortable moments when it looks like days of hard work amounted to a lot of pointless shouting into the void. Data gathered, correlations teased out, hypothesis formed, historical analogies marshalled, counterarguments tested, arguments made. Events can reduce it all to so much squawking.\n\nDay three of DeepSeekWeek had a distinct flavour of this futility. What have markets really learned? Much has been learned about AI from a technical point of view, of course. But the implications of these discoveries for the economy and corporate finance are, it must be admitted, still obscure. There is some consensus that Nvidia\u2019s competitive moat is a bit less wide than it was believed to be last week. For the rest of the Magnificent Seven, all of which have a lot at stake in the AI race, the implications of radically cheaper AI models are much less clear. Apple\u2019s strategy of not shooting tens of billions of dollars at the problems looks a little wiser now, but that\u2019s about it.\n\nThe impact on power providers is opaque, too. Of the three utilities hit hardest this week, two (Vistra and Constellation) made significant recoveries yesterday and all three are still up over the past month. Almost all of their AI-inspired gains are still in place.\n\nWe did get a smidgen of clarity last night, when Microsoft and Meta confirmed their huge capital expenditure budgets \u2014 driven by the need for compute capacity for AI \u2014 would remain vast in the near future. Meta said capital expenditure would grow 70 per cent in 2025, to as much as $65bn.\n\nStill, any recent insights into the most important trend in the most important sector in global stock markets seem very vulnerable to wholesale revision in the near term. Two familiar insights have been reinforced, however. Concentrated, expensive, and optimistic markets are sensitive beasts. Get used to short, sharp moves and countermoves, like the ones we\u2019ve seen in the past few days. And remember that AI is a technology that can surprise even its leading practitioners. Forecasts for how it is going to evolve should be treated with scepticism.\n\nBreit\u2019s blues.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9eba03c5-ee95-43c3-9ea1-749b6153dff2"}}, {"id": "1f01f095-8a37-42ba-b36a-95e97bd60514", "event_name": "Inside Trump\u2019s first strikes at Biden\u2019s climate legacy", "blurb": "Energy Source combed through the president\u2019s blizzard of executive orders on energy and climate", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning and welcome back to Energy Source, coming to you from New York.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady yesterday, defying Donald Trump\u2019s calls for deep reductions. The Fed\u2019s pause on cuts is a setback for the renewable energy industry, which has struggled from high upfront costs and faces an uncertain future amid the US president\u2019s tariffs threats and restrictions to solar and wind development.\n\nToday\u2019s Energy Source takes a first look at Trump\u2019s efforts to unpick Joe Biden\u2019s climate and clean energy legacy during his first week in office. We spent days reading through his barrage of executive orders and consulting with lawyers about the legal basis behind his rescissions. Email me if there\u2019s something we missed at: amanda.chu@ft.com.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nAmanda\n\nOn his first day back in office, US President Donald Trump signed a blizzard of executive orders, bolstering the country\u2019s fossil fuel sector and launching his first strikes at Joe Biden\u2019s climate and industrial legacy.\n\nAn FT analysis released this morning found the new president has taken more than 70 actions to undo federal commitments, initiatives, and targets aimed at combating climate change, limiting oil and gas development, and spurring the renewable energy buildout.\n\nWe spent days combing through Trump\u2019s first week of executive orders related to energy and climate, as well as the dozens of executive orders and presidential memorandums he rescinded, which date back as early as 1977.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what we found \u2014 plus a complete list of Trump\u2019s rollbacks.\n\nTrump\u2019s first executive orders declared a \u201cnational energy emergency\u201d, committed the federal government to \u201cunleashing\u201d fossil fuel production, and reversed Biden-era restrictions on the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe most significant actions include ending the following: a ban on new offshore drilling, freezing new permits for liquefied natural gas terminals and a moratorium on leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Trump also reversed Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw the permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nTrump\u2019s easing of restrictions will support oil and gas production in the longer term, but the short term impacts will probably be muted as producers confront a bearish market and investor demands for returns.\n\nClimate activists said the moves delivered on the wishes of the fossil fuel executives who helped fund his campaign and undermine US efforts to tackle global warming.\n\n\u201cOil bosses have worked hand-in-glove with their friends in politics to bake dirty fossil fuels into our energy systems,\u201d said Alice Harrison, head of fossil fuels campaigning at Global Witness, adding this was happening when parts of Los Angeles had been razed to the ground by wildfires made worse by climate change.\n\nWhen Biden took office, he promised to put climate change at the centre of his presidency, committing the US to new decarbonisation targets and establishing offices across federal agencies focused on the issue.\n\nMany of these signature efforts were eliminated overnight by Trump, including targets to achieve a 100 per cent clean electricity sector by 2035 and make half of all US car sales electric by the end of the decade. Trump also terminated Biden directives to federal agencies to protect public health and the environment, prioritise climate change in foreign policy, and address climate-related financial risk.\n\nThe executive architecture established in the Biden administration to address climate change has also been dismantled, including the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, the National Climate Task Force, and councils to address environmental justice. Justice40, a Biden initiative to direct 40 per cent of green funds to disadvantaged communities, and the Civilian Climate Corps, another signature jobs programme, are gone.\n\nFor the clean energy industry, Trump\u2019s pauses on renewables development on federal land and new leases for offshore wind have created uncertainty for investors. \u201cEven a delay of necessary permits can be disastrous for a project,\u201d said Lauren Collins, a partner at Vinson & Elkins.\n\nTrump\u2019s first week in office marked the latest in the US retreat from international efforts to address climate change. In his executive order, \u201cPutting America First in International Environmental Agreements\u201d, the president pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement for the second time, as well as other commitments made under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees the international climate negotiations.\n\nFinancial commitments abroad have also been challenged. Trump called for the immediate cessation of financial commitments the US made under the UNFCCC and ended the US International Climate Finance Plan, a Biden initiative that multiplied the country\u2019s commitments to developing countries on climate mitigation and adaptation.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive overhaul highlights the legal fragility of Biden\u2019s climate legacy, which rested heavily on executive orders because of a deeply divided Congress.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not unusual for a new president to rescind executive orders from a prior administration, lawyers warned some of Trump\u2019s actions will probably run into legal challenges and pushback from Congress. Most at risk is his pause on disbursements of hundreds of billions of dollars in green funds appropriated by Congress from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, signature pillars of Biden\u2019s industrial agenda. Trump has already eliminated White House offices to co-ordinate the implementation of these laws at federal agencies.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s making it very difficult to implement, and he\u2019s trying to shut down the effectiveness of the programme,\u201d said Camille Pannu, a professor at Columbia Law School.\n\nThe limits of executive authority have protected the primary driver of investment in clean energy: tax credits. Whether Republicans in Congress will follow Trump\u2019s attacks on Biden\u2019s industrial policies will be seen in the budget reconciliation process, where the Republicans will be eager to slash spending to finance tax cuts.\n\nRepublican-controlled districts have overwhelmingly benefited from clean energy investment following the IRA, putting congressional Republicans in a tough spot.\n\nHarrison Fields, Trump\u2019s principal deputy press secretary, said the president won a \u201cdecisive mandate\u201d from the American people and is \u201cfully committed to investing in the priorities that voters overwhelmingly supported\u201d.

There is the automated robotic coffee-dispensing machine awaiting you when you first land at San Francisco airport and driverless cars ready to ferry you about. Now artificial-intelligence powered robots are entering our salons.\n\nAn Oakland-based start-up is offering $170 eyelash extensions by beauty bot, a sci-fi version of pampering that claims more precision and dexterity than a human, and \u2014 the key draw for a demographic that tends to fixate on productivity and \u201cgrowth mindsets\u201d \u2014 in a fraction of the time.\n\nMy first question naturally was \u2014 is it safe? The stakes involved (my eyes) seem high but the beauty assistant who oversees the process said that wands at the end of the robot\u2019s arms, held on by magnets, could be easily brushed away by customers. Plus the robot is able to pause if it detects that you\u2019re sneezing or twitching.\n\nStill, as I lay, claustrophobic beneath a hulking, whirring machine not unlike an MRI scanner, it was difficult to feel completely relaxed.\n\nLUUM\u2019s proprietary technology, which was six years in the making, is designed to use computer vision to identify a customer\u2019s individual eyelashes and rapidly glue false ones on top, taking a laborious two-hour manual process closer to the 60-minute mark.\n\nWhile techno-optimists tend to focus on the power of AI and robotics to shake up sectors such as defence and manufacturing, the multibillion-dollar beauty and cosmetics industry has quietly been identified as a lucrative target by a handful of AI robot entrepreneurs.\n\nClockwork, which offers $10, 10-minute robot manicures, has already rolled out around 20 machines in the US, including two in San Francisco. Massage bots are being developed by a start-up called Aescape. And tech executives like Esther Crawford, director of product at Meta, are proudly posting pictures of their robotically-applied extensions.\n\nSo I lay back on my robot bed as it slowly raised me towards a white light so blinding it made me wince, even with my eyes taped shut (typical lash extension protocol). This was not soothing. But still, I was offering my eyes to the AI gods! I was looking into the light! I was the future!\n\nExcept not quite. As I lay there expectantly I heard the robot arms swish about and then\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009silence. The assistant explained there had been a slight issue with a newly-replaced component but that she was just fixing it. Somewhat disconcerted, I tried to remain calm when the robot started up a second time. Shortly after, another awkward silence, followed by two voices speaking in hushed tones. They were, they said, just \u201creinitialising\u201d the robot.\n\nThird time lucky and the robot got to work. My concerns were quickly allayed by its deft work. There was a light pressure as it applied each lash but nothing alarming. The application didn\u2019t feel too different to my normal beauty appointments. After about 45 minutes, the assistant added a final few lashes by hand, a sort of tidying up she called the \u201cartistry\u201d process, and we were done.\n\nQuick, convenient and the eyelashes look the part. I\u2019m told a forthcoming iteration of the machine will do both eyes at once to make proceedings even faster. Still, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d return. Part of my desired salon experience is escapism. During human-led lash treatments I can listen to music or a soothing podcast, or take a delicious daytime nap. Although I came to trust my gentle beauty bot and its magic wands, it was hard to unwind while the machine whirred like a printer and shone operating room-style lights down at me.\n\nThese bugbears will eventually be worked through and, despite protestations to the contrary by start-up CEOs, aestheticians\u2019 jobs will be cut or forever altered. The male-dominated tech industry is starting to realise that this is a consumer industry of low-hanging fruit ripe for disruption.\n\nDespite this, the era of fully automated beauty treatments is still some way off. I was very grateful for the human presence \u2014 and reminded of it when I received a text noting that I could leave a gratuity for my lash procedure via cash or a payments app. Even AI robots can\u2019t displace America\u2019s tipping culture.\n\nhannah.murphy@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f98d6b2a-a804-4f89-96d8-90a1533cda1d"}}, {"id": "adeaa81a-acf6-4649-949d-bfe5c2244a83", "event_name": "Donald Trump wiped out dozens of Joe Biden\u2019s climate initiatives in first-week blitz  ", "blurb": "President upended US efforts to combat climate change and accelerate clean energy development, according to FT analysis", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "US President Donald Trump eliminated more than 70 climate and green energy initiatives in his first week of office, launching a sweeping and aggressive move to dismantle Joe Biden\u2019s climate and industrial legacy.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive orders upended federal commitments, initiatives and targets aimed at combating climate change, limiting oil and gas development and accelerating the clean energy buildout, a Financial Times analysis of the new president\u2019s first week of executive orders found.\n\nAmong the largest rescissions included ending the ban on new offshore drilling and removing the US from the Paris climate agreement and other commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

On suppliers: good. On the green transition: mostly bad.\n\nDeepSeek has turned such conversations on their head. Following the Chinese group\u2019s release of a massively more efficient large language model, the question now is how much energy demand forecasts will need to be revised down \u2014 and where that leaves the utilities in this space.\n\nIt\u2019s mainly a US issue. While the need for rapid answers means that data centres required to use AI products are best located close to their clients, those needed to train the models can be built where power is cheap. Europe, with its expensive electricity, was always going to be a bit player here \u2014 and has hence been relatively insulated both from the excitement that gripped US utilities and from this week\u2019s ructions.\n\nIntuitively, it seems clear that US power forecasts are due for a cut. Training DeepSeek\u2019s model required less than a tenth of the computing power required to train Meta\u2019s Llama. The impact on power demand may not be entirely commensurate given data centres still need to be cooled, but this is game-changing efficiency.\n\nOnce up and running, DeepSeek may also be more efficient to use than, say, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, because it can apparently switch off the parts of its brain it\u2019s not using. True, lower costs may result in higher usage \u2014 as chipmakers the world over hope. But the risks are clearly on the downside.\n\nSuch insights are hard to translate into new long-term forecasts \u2014 not least because US electricity projections looked a bit dubious anyway. There are a lot of them. And they say very different things. That makes it difficult to understand what assumptions were baked in in the first place.\n\nMore pertinently, even if one believes that cheaper and more efficient AI leads to more AI overall, that is not going to do much to reassure investors in the US power sector. After all, assuming DeepSeek really has changed the AI calculus, greater uncertainty over the eventual shape and location of demand ought to make so-called hyperscalers more wary of committing to long-term energy contracts.\n\nOf course, while a slowdown would be bad news for energy stocks, it would be better news for the energy transition. A rapid increase in power demand would have been partly met by building new gas-fired plants. A more gradual approach gives renewables, batteries and nuclear power a better chance of filling the gap.

There is a reason why the Fed is independent,\u201d Sahm said, adding that she expected the central bank to \u201cstick to its goals\u201d.\n\nPowell has helped steer the US economy towards a soft landing over the past year, curbing price rises without pushing the economy into recession.\n\nBut inflation remains above the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target, even though it has eased sufficiently for the Fed to cut interest rates last year by a percentage point to a range between 4.25 and 4.5 per cent.\n\nWhile the market widely expects the Fed to keep rates on hold on Wednesday, Trump has made clear he wants much faster reductions.\n\n\u201cI think I know interest rates much better than they do, and I think I know them certainly much better than the one who\u2019s primarily in charge of making that decision,\u201d the president said last week. \u201cI\u2019d like to see [interest rates] come down a lot.\u201d\n\nLawrence Summers, who served as Treasury secretary under president Bill Clinton, argued that such \u201cpublic interventions by governments can easily be counterproductive\u201d.

So they cannot provide satisfying guidance about policy,\u201d said Reinhart.\n\nDespite his demands on the Fed chief, Trump has indicated that he would not remove Powell from his post before his term as chair ends in May 2026. Powell has signalled he would fight in the courts if the president attempted to oust him.\n\nSome view the pressure on the Fed as part of the trade-off for being able to set rates as its officials see fit.\n\n\u201cThe most persuasive argument for why politicians decided to make central banks independent is that they wanted somebody else to blame,\u201d said Reinhart.\n\n\u201cThat means the quid pro quo for being independent is being criticised.

But these days it\u2019s more abuzz than ever. When bars like Broken Shaker and Sweet Liberty opened around a decade ago, they demonstrated that tropical-inspired craft cocktails could go beyond the daiquiri and the mojito \u2014 and beyond the velvet ropes and stringent dress codes of South Beach. Their fun yet complex beverages \u2014 Broken Shaker\u2019s Old-Fashioned infused with Cocoa Puffs, Sweet Liberty\u2019s pi\u00f1a colada with coffee beans and PX sherry \u2014 are paired with come-as-you-are vibes. It\u2019s a combination that has earned them both national and international accolades.\n\nFollowing in their footsteps, Caf\u00e9 La Trova, run by Julio Cabrera, opened in 2019 in Little Havana and put a spotlight on the Cuban cantinero-style of bartender \u2014 known for \u201cthrowing\u201d cocktails, memorising more than 200 recipes and dressing formally in long sleeves, waistcoats and bow-ties. Cabrera trained as a cantinero in Cuba in the 1980s, and in 2023 he received an \u201cindustry icon\u201d award from North America\u2019s 50 Best Bars.

Chukwa (the colossal \u201cworld turtle\u201d from Hindu mythology) is a carbonated milk punch inspired by the Indian yoghurt-drink lassi, built with single malt whiskey, mango, cardamom and coconut. The ingredients may sound complex but they go together very smoothly. G\u00fcije (a creature said to dwell in rivers and lagoons in Cuba) is a tropical, slightly sweet and savoury rum cocktail spiced with mojo criollo (a citrus and garlic Cuban marinade), rounded out with mango and served in a hand-painted cup. And Yara-Ma-Yha-Who (a monster from Australia that preys on unsuspecting travellers) is a remake of the 1930s New Orleans cocktail Vieux Carr\u00e9, with coconut-infused rye whiskey, cognac, sweet vermouth and fig, topped with a piece of white chocolate.\n\nClassic Italian cocktails are done exceptionally well at ViceVersa, a dark- green aperitivo bar in Downtown Miami that opened its doors last June. \u201cThe first cocktails I ever made were negronis and americanos,\u201d says Rome-born co-owner Valentino Longo, who in 2020 won the Tales of the Cocktail Foundation\u2019s North America\u2019s Most Imaginative Bartender competition. \u201cIn Italy, everyone has bottles of vermouth and amaro in their homes. I wanted to bring a little bit of my culture to Miami and offer a contemporary look at aperitivo.\u201d\n\nThe house negroni has a base of its own-made dolce amaro blend, MI-TO (Milano-Torino), and is built with gin then garnished with a lime as well as orange and lemon twists, in a nod to Miami\u2019s tropical locale. The savoury martini doppio is a slightly dirty Gibson, served with a powerful onion pickled in sherry vinegar, dry vermouth, juniper, oregano and thyme. The Vice President, meanwhile, is a potent rum Manhattan \u2014 with more fortified wine than rum \u2014 topped with a negroni-infused cherry.\n\nNon-alcoholic cocktails are also available upon request, and Longo recommends the N/A spritz. \u201cWe make this with Martini Floreale, which has the same botanicals as a regular aperitivo \u2014 lemon and orange peels, rhubarb, Roman chamomile.\u201d\n\nThe food here is created in partnership with the Sunny\u2019s steakhouse team with the kitchen overseen by Carey Hynes \u2014 it\u2019s run by executive chef Justin Flit (formerly of Jaguar Sun). Don\u2019t skip the white-sauce clam pizza with middleneck clams. And on Mondays from 5pm they do a special ViceVersa burger that\u2019s extremely popular with locals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m originally from Miami,\u201d says Alexa Delgado, director of bars at The Miami Beach Edition hotel, home to chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s Matador Room restaurant and the adjacent Matador Bar. \u201cI was born right before Hurricane Andrew \u2014 something that drastically defined the city.\u201d It was also a reference point for her signature Cat 5 cocktail, a vodka-based refresher built with Sauvignon Blanc, guava, lemon and catnip. \u201cIt encompasses category-five hurricanes \u2014 it\u2019s made of five ingredients \u2014 but\u00a0it\u2019s also served in a kitschy, bespoke white-ceramic cat cup. But more than that, I really wanted it to represent the resilience of Miami and South Florida after the storms.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the drinks on the Matador Bar menu were crafted around various team members\u2019 perspectives of Miami, most of whom have moved here from out of state. On paper, the negroni colada may give the impression that it\u2019s a sweet blend of pineapple and coconut, but on the contrary, it\u2019s a stirred-down, spirit-forward bitter cocktail. \u201cIt\u2019s more the essence of tropical life,\u201d says Delgado. The non-alcoholic options are no less refreshing, including Sowing Seeds, made with distilled herbal botanicals, cucumber, ginger and lemon. Guests can choose to sit in the cosy walnut-panelled bar \u2014 often busy during after-work hours \u2014 or on the airy terrace, which is especially pretty come sundown.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks their martini recipe is the only martini recipe,\u201d says Sunny\u2019s co-owner Will Thompson. His choose-your-own-martini menu offers guests five kinds of gin, four kinds of vodka, whether they\u2019d like it dry 50/50, dirty or filthy, and an assortment of garnishes (do try the house blue-cheese olives). \u201cWe have a martini that\u2019s \u2018Our Way\u2019 with manzanilla sherry and frozen gin, but the point of this martini section is to get guests to give us the information to make the cocktail that\u2019s right for them.\u201d\n\nThis way of making people feel welcome, seen and heard while having a great time is a gift that the Boston-born Thompson possesses. It was the backbone of his first bar, Jaguar Sun in Downtown Miami, which received the Exceptional Cocktails award from the Florida Michelin Guide in 2023. While Jaguar Sun has closed its doors, its spirit lives on at Sunny\u2019s, the permanent iteration of its pandemic pop-up, which opened in October. Some drinks were carried over too, including the signature Green Ghoul \u2014 a margarita made with poblano pepper-infused tequila and mezcal, cucumber, lime and salt \u2014 and the low-ABV Valiant, with gentian liqueur, Cocchi Americano, lemon, orange bitters and salt.\n\nWhile steaks are the name of the game here \u2014 Aaron Brooks, formerly of Four Seasons Miami\u2019s Edge Steak and Bar, is executive chef \u2014 Sunny\u2019s also has an impressive raw bar. My favourites include the scallops served with aguachile negro and pickled chayote; and the Ko egg \u2014 soft-cooked, atop onion sauce and served with ossetra caviar and fingerling-potato chips, it\u2019s inspired by chef-partner Carey Hynes\u2019s time at Momofuku Ko in New York.\n\nTrue to its name, The Champagne Bar at The Surf Club has one of Miami\u2019s largest selections of champagne \u2014 more than 100 varieties \u2014 but people are also drawn to the storied, palm-fringed bar in the Four Seasons Surfside hotel for its extremely precise, elegant and dexterously crafted cocktails. The menu is a collaboration between director of bars Jonathan Gabbay, who oversees the entire beverage programme; head mixologist Leo Varona, who handles the creative side; and lead bartender Larry Olea, who manages the day-to-day operations \u2014 hailing from France, Colombia and the Dominican Republic respectively.\n\n\u201c[We drew] inspiration from Miami\u2019s vibrant and diverse neighbourhoods, with each area represented through signature cocktails that celebrate its unique history, culture and flavours,\u201d says Varona. Case in point, Lemon City is named after the historical district now known as Little Haiti; the refreshing tribute to the area\u2019s abundant lemon groves features gin infused with lemon and lemongrass, hints of mezcal and coconut water, topped with a limoncello foam. Banana Cabana, meanwhile, is a playful take on the classic banana daiquiri and a homage to the poolside cabanas of Miami Beach, crafted with bourbon, rum, banana and coconut cordial and sherry. Most of the cocktails on the menu can also be enjoyed as a non-alcoholic option, while bar bites include Hokkaido-scallop skewers and saffron arancini with spicy bluefin tuna tartare by executive chef Marco Calenzo. Plus there\u2019s live music on weekends, when the in-house DJ is joined by a saxophonist or violinist.\n\nWho in your opinion does the best cocktails in Miami? Tell us in the comments below.

It assesses more than 10,000 ETFs and its latest data indicates that 7.7 per cent of them included securities sanctioned by one or more government, and that there has been a 700 per cent increase in the number of sanctioned securities over the past two years.\n\n\u201cWith sanctions, to some extent, you have to try to predict the future,\u201d said Sara Nordin, partner at law firm White & Case.\n\nSIX SSMS said the majority of the ETFs holding sanctioned securities were domiciled in China, the US and Ireland, in that order, but this statistic did not mean the ETFs were in breach of any domestic regulations.\n\nFor example, the recent decision by the US to add to the blacklist of sanctioned Chinese companies deemed to have links to Beijing\u2019s military resulted in the removal of a group of telecoms companies from global indices, but that does not mean domestic Hong Kong or Chinese investors cannot invest in them.\n\n\u201cAssessing exposure in ETFs is complex, and vigilance is just as paramount for issuers as it is for brokers and other investors,\u201d said Oliver Bodmer, senior product manager at SIX Financial Information.\n\nThe complexity deepens because of the different rules applied by different jurisdictions.\n\n\u201c[ETF] Issuers need to stay on top of securities sanctioned in their jurisdiction, but also in the jurisdictions of the investors they intend to target for the instrument,\u201d Bodmer said.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, investors must ensure they are not investing in funds that hold sanctioned securities beyond the prescribed thresholds \u2014 which varies by jurisdiction and sanctions regime.\u201d\n\nSanctions imposed by successive US administrations already include pages of orders limiting trading or other dealings with, for example, corporations identified as being involved in the Chinese military industrial complex as well as entities connected to Iran and Russia.\n\nThe EU has its own list that focuses strongly on Russia. The UK, too, has its own sanctions list.\n\nBut those working to advise the industry point out that risk assessment for fund managers and investors requires more than simply referring to a list.\n\n\u201cThe chain of exposure to sanctions could potentially be endless, for example if a sanctions measure prohibits \u2018indirect\u2019 transactions, through one or more third parties, with sanctioned persons,\u201d said Nordin, who has also seen a jump in demand for its sanctions-related advice.\n\n\u201cWhether a company would be liable for any sanctions violation that may arise as a result of indirect transactions with sanctioned persons generally comes down to diligence and risk management,\u201d she added.\n\nRisk management also depends on how likely a violation will be identified and pursued by authorities, as well as whether there can be any defence of an alleged violation and what the likely penalty will be.\n\nLawyers said that in the EU there are legal principles that mean that if you can show you have made reasonable efforts to carry out due diligence, such as by using a reputable screening service, then the regulator might accept this as a reasonable defence.\n\nIn contrast, the US Office of Foreign Assets Control operates on a so-called strict liability basis, which means that \u201ca person subject to US jurisdiction may be held civilly liable even if such person did not have knowledge that it was engaging in a transaction that was prohibited under sanctions laws and regulations\u201d, Ofac explains on its website.\n\nOfac also pursues so-called secondary sanctions, which can target non-US entities engaging in activities with sanctioned parties, even if those activities have no direct connection to the US.\n\nThe penalties can be severe. Last year EFG International, a Swiss private banking group, agreed to pay $3.7mn to settle an \u201capparent violation\u201d of the US\u2019s Cuban Asset Control Regulations. Ofac said the amount reflected the fact that EFG\u2019s \u201capparent violations were voluntarily self-disclosed and were non-egregious\u201d \u2014 in other words, the penalty could have been much higher.\n\nNavigating possible exposure to sanctions risks falls heavily on asset managers and can affect the value of investments held by retail investors too.\n\nHowever, Kenneth Lamont, principal at Morningstar, said there should be no surprises for end investors. \u201cI would argue the very real potential for investment restrictions is less of a compliance issue and more of an investment risk baked into investing in some emerging markets,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBroadly speaking, if we see a new wave of sanctions on companies Chinese or otherwise, this will increase compliance costs,\u201d he added, though he pointed out these increased costs would \u201cstill pale in comparison\u201d when compared with compliance costs around environmental social and governance factors and consumer duty.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8aa30442-3063-46c8-91e0-732d23af18cf"}}, {"id": "da9a59d4-ce17-4494-9557-494ff78c5131", "event_name": "Donald Trump\u2019s commerce nominee Howard Lutnick accused of conflict of interest", "blurb": "Billionaire entrepreneur expected to be confirmed after senate hearing", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Billionaire businessman Howard Lutnick will face a senate hearing on Wednesday for his nomination to be Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of commerce, as questions swirl over whether his pledge to unwind his significant holdings will be enough to avoid numerous conflicts of interest.\n\nIf confirmed, the chief executive of Wall Street brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald and major Trump donor will be the president\u2019s emissary to the business community he once helped lead \u2014 and will oversee a department with sway over many of his prior interests, including cryptocurrencies, the commercial satellite sector and the microchip industry.\n\nTrump nominated Lutnick to \u201clead our tariff and trade agenda\u201d, although the commerce department typically focuses on priorities such as patents and economic data, the national weather service, the census and, recently, chip manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWe plan to end the decades of policies that threw American workers to the wolves,\u201d Lutnick said in a speech during Trump\u2019s inauguration festivities.\n\nIn a letter to ethics officials, Lutnick said he would resign from his brokerage firm and divest his holdings in a host of companies \u2014 including BGC Group, which has a joint-venture with a Chinese company \u2014 if confirmed as commerce secretary.\n\nBut while he pledged that his wife and young children would not purchase the divested assets, he did not give a similar assurance about his adult children, two of whom work for Cantor companies. Without this, Lutnick\u2019s divestments mean \u201cvery little in practical terms\u201d, said Tony Carrk, the executive director of the advocacy group Accountable.us.\n\nCarrk said: \u201cIt\u2019s what Lutnick didn\u2019t say that speaks volumes\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009from what we see, Lutnick\u2019s conflicts of interest will continue to loom over the department, and that could cost everyday consumers.\u201d\n\nCantor declined to comment.\n\nOne of Cantor\u2019s largest holdings \u2014 it recently reported a $1.2bn stake \u2014 is in AI chipmaker Nvidia. Under former president Joe Biden, the commerce department was delegated to investigate how Nvidia chips ended up in China, despite a US ban on advanced semiconductor exports.\n\nA vocal cheerleader for crypto, Lutnick has a strong interest in the stablecoin Tether, in which Cantor has a stake of an undisclosed size. The financial services firm also manages a significant portion of Tether\u2019s reserves, now primarily held in US Treasury bills.\n\nWithin the commerce department sits the Office of Space Commerce, which has jurisdiction over radio spectra used by satellites and exports of aerospace products, among other matters. Cantor is invested in Uruguay-based earth observation company Satellogic, which has a long-standing commercial partnership with fellow billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, and has established a US presence in an attempt to win lucrative government contracts in its own right.\n\nLutnick resigned from Satellogic\u2019s board in November, following Trump\u2019s win.\n\nLast month, Cantor agreed to pay a $6.75mn penalty to settle charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly making misleading statements to investors in the lead up to two public offerings that raised $750mn. The company has also had multiple run-ins with other federal regulatory bodies, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\n\nAlthough Lutnick plans to resign as Cantor\u2019s chief executive and sell his stake within 90 days of being confirmed, some of his family will remain embedded in the firm.\n\nThe entrepreneur\u2019s son Brandon, who previously worked for Tether, took the helm of Cantor\u2019s newest blank-cheque company last month, according to regulatory filings. The special purpose acquisition company plans to raise $200mn and merge with a private enterprise.\n\nLutnick is expected to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nTed Cruz, who chairs the committee that will question Lutnick, said he was \u201can excellent choice\u201d to lead the commerce department, and that \u201chis vast experience will serve him well in his mission to promote America\u2019s unlimited entrepreneurial spirit\u201d.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/25f79264-0557-49c3-bf8b-a645f63482d0"}}, {"id": "fe4db6ee-573f-4d7b-bdd5-e554664022b1", "event_name": "Inside the Trump tariff debate", "blurb": "US Treasury secretary wants levies to rise month by month, starting at 2.5%", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Advances in artificial intelligence by Chinese start-up DeepSeek caused a frantic sell-off of energy and infrastructure shares, and Donald Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary is pushing for new universal tariffs to start at 2.5 per cent.

And his 2020 electoral defeat suggests bitter losses can still lead to future success. US Steel CEO David Burritt is seeking a similar redemption arc.\n\nBurritt engineered the $15bn sale of his company to Nippon Steel in 2023, only to see it blocked in the last weeks of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Trump, for his part, never favoured selling the company to a foreign buyer. Nor did the United Steelworkers of America. But the buyout agreement has yet to be terminated and US Steel and Nippon are holding out hope that the newly inaugurated Trump can be persuaded to reverse Biden\u2019s verdict.\n\nWhile the US Steel boss fights the last battle, some investors have moved on to a new one. Earlier this week, hedge fund Ancora Holdings declared it wants fellow shareholders to replace the board and sack Burritt, whom it thinks can no longer effectively govern. It is not uncommon for a CEO to leave when a big transaction falls apart, but Burritt insists that his final chapter is not written.\n\nAncora may be harsh to fault Burritt for pursuing the deal with Nippon, as if an unprecedented brawl over a buyer from an allied nation was predictable. The Nippon share price offer, more than double where US Steel was previously trading, came amid a process kicked off by a hostile bid for US Steel from another rival, Cleveland Cliffs.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s not like buyer and seller didn\u2019t try to get the deal through. Nippon made generous, if uneconomic, concessions to allow local control of its prey. With Burritt at the helm, US Steel is pursuing two lawsuits, one over the Washington rejection and another over the union and Cleveland Cliffs\u2019 attempts to scotch the deal. Besides, failure isn\u2019t so bad. A Nippon abandonment would secure a $565mn termination fee for US Steel.\n\nIf the merger proves truly dead, the question of who should run the steelmaker is worth asking. Ancora says Burritt has failed as an operator and describes its candidate to replace him, industry executive Alan Kestenbaum, as a steel-sector \u201clegend\u201d. Such a person would come in handy: US Steel\u2019s current share price is just $36, far below the $55 on offer from Nippon.\n\nThe biggest challenge for Burritt is that, unless he can revive the Nippon deal before its June drop-dead date, he must provide a persuasive vision of how US Steel can thrive on its own. Yet his brokering of the Nippon deal suggests he doesn\u2019t think it can. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if shareholders are ready to give Ancora, which may have its own M&A angle, a hearing.\n\nsujeet.indap@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/68ac9eef-6cc2-481d-bae4-f75e88ce2a0a"}}, {"id": "f55d22de-02a7-4e75-b3f3-270dc0d2de23", "event_name": "Mexico and Canada launch flurry of border measures to appease Trump", "blurb": "Tariff threat spurs Mexico to fill in smuggling tunnel and Canada to deploy helicopters and drones", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Mexico and Canada have begun a flurry of activity at their US borders to show they are willing to clamp down on migrants ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s deadline to impose punitive tariffs.\n\nIn the Mexican city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez on the US border, workers began filling in a 300 metre tunnel this week used to smuggle migrants into Texas.

Last year it stepped up checks and detentions further across the country, focusing on busing foreign migrants southwards.\n\nMexico is also under pressure over drug cartels that supply substances including the deadly opioid fentanyl to the US. Curbing that trade is difficult, with combined murders and disappearances in the country close to record highs.\n\nSecurity Minister Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch said on Tuesday that since October more than 10,000 people had been detained for high-impact crimes such as murder and violent robbery, and more than 90 tonnes of drugs seized.\n\nThe situation on Canada\u2019s border with the US differs from Mexico\u2019s.

But that has not prevented Trump from threatening it, alongside Mexico. In recent months both Mexico and Canada have announced large drug busts.\n\nCanadian foreign minister M\u00e9lanie Joly, who will travel to Washington DC to meet Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday, said this week she would also speak with Mexico, the UK and EU counterparts.\n\n\u201cAt the heart of my conversations with my British colleagues and my European colleagues is going to be the question of how to respond to tariffs,\u201d she said on Monday.\n\nIn December Canada announced an extra C$1.3bn (US $900mn) to bolster border security and the immigration system.

Trump has voiced frustration with Canada over it taking the US for granted.\u201d\n\nMexico and Canada have lobbied lawmakers and others in the president\u2019s circle, arguing that tariffs would be a \u201close-lose\u201d situation for all three countries.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s crackdown, some migrants in Mexico remain hopeful. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of staying here quietly, waiting,\u201d said Gabriel, a 23-year-old from Venezuela, at the border. \u201cI feel that at any moment we\u2019ll be able to cross legally, or something good will happen.\u201d\n\nThis article\u00a0has been amended to make clear that since June last year, US authorities have found around 100,000 people a month crossing irregularly from Mexico and 15,000 from Canada, not illegally as originally stated.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/08c8b7cc-add8-49d1-996f-22b3ad2d5847"}}, {"id": "d59bcfcd-3e79-42c8-9384-9e9ffd3ac79e", "event_name": "Donald Trump pressures Egypt and Jordan to accept Gaza \u2018clean out\u2019 plan", "blurb": "US president could use aid as leverage to ensure countries back his idea of relocating people from enclave", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Donald Trump has ratcheted up the pressure on Egypt to take in Palestinians from Gaza, raising the prospect that the US president could use substantial aid as leverage for his idea of resettling people from the shattered enclave.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One on Monday, the US president repeated his call \u2014 which has sparked outrage from Palestinians and Arabs across the Middle East \u2014 for both Egypt and Jordan to take in Gazans and help \u201cclean out\u201d the strip. He added that he had spoken to Egypt\u2019s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.\n\n\u201cI wish he would take some. We helped them a lot, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d help us,\u201d Trump said when asked how Sisi had responded. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of mine. He\u2019s in a very rough part of the world, to be honest. As they say, it\u2019s a rough neighbourhood. But I think he would do it, and I think the King of Jordan would do it too.\u201d\n\nEgypt denied \u201cwhat some media outlets reported\u201d about the call between the two leaders. Since Trump first made the suggestion over the weekend, Cairo and Amman have vehemently rejected the idea, arguing it would undermine Palestinians\u2019 long-held hopes of establishing their own state and the security of their own countries.\n\nAnalysts said Trump\u2019s comments, which came just days after secretary of state Marco Rubio ordered an immediate halt to work on virtually all US foreign aid programmes, underscored the potential leverage Washington had over both Egypt and Jordan, as well as the US president\u2019s willingness to flex it.\n\n\u201cThis a classic Trump negotiation tactic, coming in with an extreme position in order to\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009get somewhere in the middle,\u201d said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and north Africa programme at Chatham House. But she said Trump\u2019s demands touched on \u201creal existential\u201d questions for both Jordan and Egypt.\n\nOn Tuesday, the front page of Egypt\u2019s state-owned Al-Ahram daily featured a large picture of displaced Palestinians streaming back to north Gaza with the headline: \u201cEgypt [speaks] as one man: The people reject displacement and support efforts to protect national security as the Palestinians write their \u2018epic of return\u2019.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, was similarly dismissive, saying on Sunday that \u201cthe solution to the Palestinian issue lies in Palestine\u201d.\n\n\u201cJordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians,\u201d he said.\n\nArabs have for more than a year warned against any moves to push Palestinians out of Gaza, saying it would be akin to 1948, when hundreds of thousands were forced from their homes or fled in the fighting that accompanied Israel\u2019s founding. Palestinians refer to that period as the Nakba, or catastrophe.\n\nMichael Wahid Hanna, director of the US programme at the International Crisis Group, said that while it was not clear how far Trump would go, one pressure point on Egypt would be the $1.3bn of annual military assistance received by Cairo to buy US weapons and spare parts for US materiel purchased in previous years.\n\nThe assistance, which started in 1978 when Cairo took the first steps towards a peace deal with Israel, signed the next year, has been \u201cthe backbone of ties\u201d, said Hanna. It has amounted to more than $50bn over the years.\n\nMilitary assistance to Egypt and Israel has been exempted from the three-month hold on international aid announced by Rubio.\n\nHanna added that if Trump tried to coerce Egypt into taking Palestinians displaced from Gaza, it would be a \u201cbig change to the relationship\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe US has worked for a very long time on the assumption that it would be dangerous for Egypt and was something to avoid,\u201d he said. When the idea of resettling Palestinians was floated at the beginning of the Gaza war, he added, Egypt argued it could threaten domestic stability because neither the military establishment nor public opinion would approve.\n\n\u201cA massive influx of Palestinians would raise fears of rekindling the insurgency [by an Isis affiliate] in the Sinai because of a mixing of Palestinian and Egyptian militants,\u201d said Hanna.\n\nAnalysts said the US could use similar pressure against Jordan, where Washington is the biggest provider of foreign aid, on which Jordan\u2019s fragile economy is heavily dependent.\n\nAccording to the US embassy in Amman, the US has provided $31bn of bilateral assistance since relations were established in 1949, and the two countries recently signed a memorandum of understanding under which Washington would provide $1.45bn a year until 2029.\n\nDiplomats said officials in Amman were rushing to understand Trump\u2019s intentions, and that in addition to withholding aid, the US could also apply pressure by imposing tariffs. \u201cGiven where Jordan\u2019s economy is at the moment, any move could have a bigger impact than you might think,\u201d said one.\n\nA large influx of Palestinians would have significant ramifications for Jordan\u2019s delicate political and economic situation: the 11mn-strong country is already home to more than 2mn Palestinians, while its economy has been strained by the cost of supporting hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees.\n\nImplementing Trump\u2019s idea would \u201creally threaten security dynamics in both countries, and the political legitimacy of the leaders\u201d, Vakil said.\n\n\u201cIt will be very hard [for them] to kowtow on these issues and see a quick turnaround like we have seen in the case of Colombia or Canada [when pressured by Trump].

Today let\u2019s get into:\n\nFighting inflation is quickly falling down the list of President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities as he pursues his isolationist policies at a clip.\n\nVoters consistently ranked economic issues including the cost of living as the most important issue in deciding their choice for president, according to the FT-Michigan Ross poll. But those voters are set to be disappointed, economists have warned, as Trump pursues aggressive tariffs.\n\n\u201cThe policies he\u2019s pursuing have a high risk of inflation,\u201d Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics think-tank, told the FT\u2019s Claire Jones. Instead, attacking US trade partners is \u201ca higher priority than the purchasing power of the working class\u201d.\n\nEconomists, on average, have revised up their inflation projections from 2.2 per cent to 2.6 per cent for 2025, according to forecast aggregator Consensus Economics, on signals that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d protectionism will raise prices. In this scenario, the US Federal Reserve could be left struggling to cut interest rates, which Trump is pressuring chair Jay Powell to do.\n\nIf rates don\u2019t come down quickly, there could be fresh tensions between the two men. Fed officials are almost certain to hold interest rates steady at their meeting tomorrow \u2014 and the median view among rate setters is that there\u2019ll be only two quarter-point cuts this year.\n\nDuring the past several years, US consumers experienced price increases of more than 20 per cent \u2014 the worst inflation surge in a generation.\n\n\u201cIf you really thought this guy was going to do something about the price of eggs, then you are probably going to be brutally disappointed,\u201d said Mark Blyth, professor at Brown University. \u201c[His stance is] \u2018We can\u2019t give you cheap groceries, but we can give you the Gulf of America\u2019.\u201d\n\nAnother thing economists are worried about: what will happen to inflation if and when the president\u2019s mass deportations come about, since worker shortages usually raise wages.\n\nThere are roughly 11mn undocumented people in the US, and deporting them all is a central pillar of Trump\u2019s Maga agenda. But a genuine mass deportation could also face enormous financial, legal and logistical hurdles at every step of the process: identification, apprehension, detention and expulsion [free to read].\n\nEven at an improbable rate of deporting 1mn people annually, it would take more than 10 years and cost almost $1tn, according to the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration non-profit group. Lawsuits are also expected at every turn.\n\n\u201cThe idea of 1mn to 2mn [deportations] a year is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009aspirational. It\u2019s probably unrealistic, given the resources that are available to do it,\u201d Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a predecessor agency to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told me. \u201cThe numbers are not likely to be dramatically greater [than they are now], at least for a while.\u201d\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, under the Biden administration, Ice deported 271,484 unauthorised immigrants, a 10-year high. The peak under Trump\u2019s first term was 267,000 in fiscal year 2019. Trump and his border tsar, Tom Homan, have said they will prioritise people with criminal histories, a more politically palatable way to get started.\n\nThe administration has already launched showy raids in Chicago, and went to the brink of a trade war with Colombia after Bogot\u00e1 rejected military repatriation flights. The dramatic clash left Latin American nations reeling as they prepare for an emergency summit on Thursday to respond to mass deportations.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/cad08dc0-737b-4da3-948d-7f265f479615"}}, {"id": "83bfd919-cf8c-4940-adb0-ef00ec082274", "event_name": "Trump and the Dr Strangelove experiment", "blurb": "The president revels in his unpredictability but over time he risks sowing distrust in America\u2019s good faith", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Do as I say or I might be crazy enough to blow everyone up. That is the essence of the Dr Strangelove playbook \u2014 that acting the madman will scare your enemies into concessions. In the movie, budget-constrained US generals save dollars by nuking the Soviet Union. Donald Trump is highly unlikely to launch nuclear weapons. But he would surely be happy if others thought that he might. Nor is he insane for believing the Strangelovian approach might work. It has served him well for his first 78 years.\n\nThere is no need to retread how a serially bankrupted Trump menaced creditors during his casino days, or how supporters storming Capitol Hill to stop the count became a rallying cry for his re-election. Playing the lunatic has been a routine tool of Trump\u2019s career. Never give the middle finger to your creditors; avoid at all costs describing fallen soldiers as losers. Had Trump heeded such advice he would not be president. In his mind, reasonable people are clueless about power and negotiating. \u201cIt is the rational optimist who fails, the irrational optimist who succeeds,\u201d wrote GK Chesterton. \u201cHe is ready to smash the whole universe for the sake of itself.\u201d\n\nReactions to Trump\u2019s first week in office are unlikely to damp his instinct for unpredictability. His avalanche of executive orders, collective firings and sweeping pledge to usher in a new golden age was meant to give the shock and awe impression that he was remaking the world. One of Trump\u2019s billionaire donors even compared his first seven days to the almighty. In fact, Trump\u2019s big win \u2014 securing a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza \u2014 came several days before he was inaugurated (or said \u201cLet there be light!\u201d, depending on your grip on reality). Neither Hamas nor the Israelis cared that Joe Biden had been pushing for a ceasefire for many months. With Trump, they obeyed in advance.\n\nTrump can also claim that he shocked Colombia into accepting his terms for sending them illegal immigrants. But the moral of last weekend\u2019s scrap is fuzzier than that. Trump announced a tariff war and a visa ban on the South American republic after it refused to accept two US military planes carrying shackled deportees. President Gustavo Petro responded with florid insults while quietly sending a civilian plane to collect them. Cue Trump victory dance. In reality, Colombia has accepted hundreds of US deportee flights in recent years, which means Petro did not concede much. Yet other countries might now think twice before crossing Trump.\n\nDenmark\u2019s European neighbours have also been prompted to rethink their ideas about standing up to bullies. Trump shocked Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, by haranguing her for 45 minutes earlier this month over why the US should acquire Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. The principled stance would be for France, Britain and others to link arms with Denmark and say, \u201cEnough! America cannot trample over other countries\u2019 sovereignty.\u201d But that would be a crazy thing to do, right? Their actual response has been predictably supine. Europe\u2019s liberal democracies are behaving exactly how Trump expected they would \u2014 with fawning towards the source of the problem. They might as well have invited Trump to keep going.\n\nThe bigger test case is the Panama Canal Zone, where the US is treaty-bound to accept Panamanian sovereignty. Even if Trump browbeats Panama to revoke its ports contracts with CK Hutchison, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate, his win could be pyrrhic. Panama\u2019s president has been notably more robust than his Danish counterpart. So have Panama\u2019s neighbours. In contrast to Canada\u2019s outgoing Justin Trudeau, Mexico\u2019s president Claudia Sheinbaum set limits before Trump took office in her gutsy response to his threat of a tariff war. Colombia\u2019s Petro was also tenacious. It is no coincidence that a Chinese diplomat on Sunday said that Colombia-China relations were their strongest in 45 years.\n\nIn the short term, Trump\u2019s tactics could well yield more wins than Biden, whose diplomacy looked better on paper than in practice. It is likely that Europeans will step up defence spending for fear of Trump\u2019s ire. He has said that Russia could \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d with allies that spend too little. Over time, however, Trump will sow distrust about America\u2019s word. Deals will start to dry up. Large parts of the world long ago gave up on the notion of a US-led liberal international order, which makes them sanguine about the ascent of the \u201cugly American\u201d. Yet they will be hunting for insurance. It would be no surprise were China in the near future to win more friends and influence in Trump\u2019s hemisphere.\n\nedward.luce@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c10c0f3a-bf03-4f5b-8975-426cc37200cc"}}, {"id": "38c98896-d318-415e-ba7e-63065bafd8e8", "event_name": "The promise and peril of an offshore digital (government) dollar", "blurb": "Trump\u2019s recent executive order is shortsighted", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Vincient Arnold is a researcher at the Yale Program on Financial Stability and publishes research notes on his blog, Discursive Etc. The views expressed herein are his own.\n\nThe United States would seriously like to maintain the supremacy of the US dollar as an international reserve currency, and BRICS coin \u2014 unseriously \u2014 would like to replace it.\n\nWhatever the (lack of) merits of a BRICS coin, there are real, lurking challenges to the dollar\u2019s role abroad. A forward-looking response to the dollar threats of tomorrow, not just today, would be to lead the pack in the development of a cross-border wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC): ie, the offshore digital dollar. However, President Trump just signed an executive order banning the development of all CBDCs in the US, while supporting the development of stablecoins.\n\nNow, I have no qualms with the value of stablecoins in supporting the dollar system, as I\u2019ve written elsewhere. But, as experiences in the Eurodollar market have shown, privately-created money \u2014 while a great complement to central bank money \u2014 is no perfect replacement. A CBDC is still worthy of consideration, and Mr. Trump\u2019s order is, on that front, shortsighted.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced, though, that the executive order is really targeting wCBDCs in the first place? In it, CBDCs are defined as \u201ca form of digital money or monetary value, denominated in the national unit of account, that is a direct liability of the central bank.\u201d As many FT Alphaville readers are very likely aware, we already have digital money that is a direct liability of the Fed: reserves. Surely Mr. Trump is not suggesting that we get rid of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet?\n\nGiven previous Republican opposition to CBDCs, it\u2019s pretty clear that their issue is retail CBDCs \u2014 in other words, a digital form of cash \u2014 over privacy concerns. What I humbly suggest should still be on the table (and may still be, given the vague wording of the EO) is simply the crypto-ification of existing central bank reserves. It would be far from straightforward and would come with costs as well as benefits. But it seems the possibility should at least be considered, particularly given that it would be complementary to offshore dollar stablecoin issuance.\n\nHow would that differ from today\u2019s reserves? Currently, reserves are limited to US commercial banks and exist in ledger form. Unlike traditional central bank reserves, policymakers could design a wCBDC to be tokenised, meaning that the liability on the central bank balance sheet would be to whomever holds a token representing some quantum of reserves.\n\nSimilar to the distinction between checking accounts and cash, the distinction between current digital reserves and a wCBDC is that the former is account-based, whereas the latter is token-based. More radically, this wCBDC would be cross-border, with foreign banks able to hold the tokens.\n\nSuch a leap holds great appeal. The Eurodollar market \u2014 including, crucially, stablecoins \u2014 would operate on firmer ground and, given the nature of fractional reserve banking, the quantity of dollar deposits abroad would balloon, strengthening and entrenching the appeal of the dollar. More dollars abroad under a system of programmable tokens would mean more offshore transaction information \u2014 fortifying American sanctioning capacity and restricting the financing of terrorism. Broadened access to dollar accounts abroad might even help the world digest spates of ever-expanding Treasury issuance. And reasoning defensively, China already has a first-mover advantage on a cross-border wCBDC, putting the US at risk of being left behind.\n\nHow would the offshore digital dollar work? Start with the obvious design decision: access. You\u2019d probably have a tiered system, such that commercial banks in higher-risk (in an AML/CFT sense) countries with under-developed financial systems and poor bank regulation would have very limited access; moderate-risk nations would have moderate access; and so on, on a sliding scale. With tokenisation, the digital tokens would be programmed with various parameters (\u201cthis can\u2019t go to accounts in North Korea\u201d), which would aid in risk control. It would almost certainly be limited to depository institutions.\n\nThe Eurodollar market \u2014 that is, dollars created/intermediated outside of the US (including offshore stablecoins), or the offshore dollar market \u2014 has operated for decades with no official backstop from the US. Foreign commercial banks promise dollars on demand to their customers (in the form of deposits), with dollar assets backing them. But if they ran out of dollar assets? They don\u2019t have access to the Fed. There\u2019s no FDIC for the offshore dollar market. Even so, partially out of self-interest and partially in the interest of broader global stability, the Fed has episodically intervened in the Eurodollar market to provide backstop liquidity. That would very quickly need to become official.\n\nWould foreign commercial banks have access to the discount window? Almost certainly not. But there would need to be some kind of parallel system, even if it were intermediated by foreign central banks (like an expanded network of swap lines or repo facilities). If stablecoins are meant to support the dollar offshore, the need for such a formalised backstop would only grow.\n\nPrecisely because of the above, American commercial banks holding Fed reserves are supervised by the Fed. The Fed can\u2019t, and wouldn\u2019t, supervise offshore banks, so co-operation with foreign bank supervisory authorities would be crucial. The tiered system would help limit the complication, but multilateralism, in short supply these days, would be a must.\n\nDirect claims on the Fed already circulate widely around the world: crisp green cash. But that cash doesn\u2019t earn interest. In an interest-on-reserves policy world, the Fed\u2019s hand would probably be forced in remunerating all its reserves, inclusive of a tokenised wCBDC.\n\nIn practice, the Fed already in effect maintains an offshore dollar monetary policy: the floor is set by the rate on the FIMA reverse repo pool and the ceiling by the FIMA repo facility. With stablecoins offering higher rates, such an offshore wCBDC deployment would in effect create an offshore parallel to the onshore dollar hierarchy between official money and private money, interest rates and all.\n\nThe risk of volatile capital flows would pose a regulatory challenge to both stablecoins and any offshore wCBDC. If I\u2019m an emerging market central bank, and I\u2019ve sorted out capital flow regulations (and gotten the IMF off my back about it), I probably don\u2019t want a bunch of digital dollar wallets sprouting up all over the place.\n\nWhat could be worse for capital flows/foreign exchange stability than the ability for citizens to run out of their native currency into dollar accounts in their own country? Here, wCBDCs have an advantage over stablecoins and, developed in careful co-operation with foreign authorities (in potentially bespoke nature, given their programmability), could calm the nerves of host country policymakers.\n\nThe offshore digital dollar is pretty radical \u2014 more radical, perhaps, than it initially sounds. Many benefits would likely await the US, but, like everything in economics, there\u2019s no free lunch here. The peril of becoming lender of last resort to functionally the whole world, political indigestion from paying interest on the reserves, and bureaucratic complexity.\n\nYet, it\u2019s also less radical than it sounds. Direct offshore claims on the Fed already exist in the form of cash, a much dirtier dollar. And a wCBDC wouldn\u2019t be creating the offshore dollar market; it already exists. To the extent the Fed would have to provide emergency liquidity, it\u2019s unclear that\u2019s something it\u2019s not already doing.\n\nIf the plan is to have stablecoins around the world, better to pair them with an official version: the offshore digital dollar.

There was no official explanation from Iranian officials. But the move captured a quiet shift in Tehran\u2019s thinking, in what is shaping up to be its most consequential year since the 1980s Iran-Iraq war: with the country at its most vulnerable point in years, officials hope they can avoid confrontation and even strike a deal with the new president.\n\nThe return of their b\u00eate noire to the White House is happening just as Iran\u2019s long nuclear stand-off with the west comes to a head. It also follows a year of conflict that has changed the power dynamics in the Middle East at Tehran\u2019s expense, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emboldened by a string of battlefield gains that dealt the Islamic republic and its regional proxies devastating blows.\n\nIsrael, which traded two rounds of tit-for-tat strikes with Iran last year, claims to have destroyed much of its air defences; Tehran\u2019s main proxy, the Lebanese movement Hizbollah, has been debilitated; and the toppling of the Assad regime in Syria has robbed it of a key ally. With this in mind, analysts say Iran can ill-afford to antagonise Trump and risk more military conflict with Israel and even the US.\n\n\u201cIt is a very critical year, largely because the strategic context for Iran has changed drastically,\u201d said Vali Nasr, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \u201cWhat Iran has lost is a way of managing Israel and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009its hand is weaker with the Europeans and the Americans.\u201d\n\nThe expectation is that Trump, who in his first term abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal Tehran signed with world powers and ramped up sanctions in a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign, will return to his hardline policies.\n\nBut there are also hints he may be willing to bargain. Trump has delegated his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to explore whether diplomatic accommodation with Iran is possible, saying last week that \u201cit would really be nice if [tensions over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme] could be worked out\u201d.\n\nWestern diplomats say the government of reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has for weeks signalled more willingness to agree to a negotiated settlement to secure relief and ease domestic economic pressure, but also because of Iran\u2019s weakened position and desire to avoid military confrontation with the US and Israel.\n\nBut they warn that, if that fails, Iran is on a collision course with the west. European powers that opposed Trump\u2019s maximum pressure during his first term have become more angry with Iran\u2019s behaviour, including the continued expansion of its nuclear activity, its arms sales to Russia and its alleged targeting of citizens in the west.\n\nWith Iran enriching uranium close to weapons-grade level \u2014 and closer than it has ever been to having the capacity to produce nuclear bombs \u2014 diplomats say they want action not words.\n\nThe 2015 accord\u2019s \u201csunset clauses\u201d are set to expire in October, which will lift restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities and in effect signal the termination of the moribund agreement.\n\nAs that date nears, a risk for Iran is that western powers trigger the so-called snapback process that would lead to the reimposition of UN sanctions and further international isolation if there is no alternative deal.\n\nInside Iran, reformists have begun public debates to pressure Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, and the elite Revolutionary Guard to negotiate, arguing that this may be the regime\u2019s last chance to avert a crisis.\n\nPezeshkian \u201chas the opportunity to take significant steps for Iran\u201d, said Hossein Marashi, a senior reformist politician, during a speech this month. \u201cHis first mission should be a new chapter in foreign policy. We no longer hold leverage in Lebanon, Syria or Iraq.\u201d\n\nIranian analysts said, however, that Tehran does not want to be seen to negotiate out of desperation.\n\n\u201cWhile we resist US pressure, we will also signal a willingness to negotiate,\u201d said a relative of Khamenei. \u201cIran is working to minimise actions that might provoke Washington, even if no agreement is eventually reached.\u201d\n\nThe relative of Khamenei acknowledged that Israel\u2019s attacks on Iran and the so-called \u201caxis of resistance\u201d of Tehran-backed militant groups, including Hizbollah and Hamas, had led Iranian leaders to reassess their perception of the republic\u2019s power in the Middle East.\n\nBut he added that Tehran retains tools \u201cto alter the battlefield\u201d, without elaborating: \u201cThe Islamic republic has suffered blows, but there will be no strategic U-turns in its domestic and foreign policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Iranians don\u2019t see themselves as weak in the way in which they\u2019re being portrayed. They have inherent weaknesses, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Nasr said. \u201cBut they estimate that there are constraints on Trump if he doesn\u2019t pursue the diplomatic path, and that the risks are quite high for a military conflict that the US cannot then control.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump implemented his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy against Iran during his first term, Iranian forces were blamed for sabotage attacks on tankers in the Gulf and a missile and drone strike in 2019 on Saudi oil infrastructure.\n\nBut Trump also displayed his unpredictability. After initially indicating that he was not willing to use military action, he in 2020 ordered the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, Iran\u2019s most powerful commander, pushing the foes briefly to the brink of war.\n\nSome experts said the blows to the axis, which have diminished Iran\u2019s regional influence, could mean Tehran would be more willing to strike a deal with Trump to seek security guarantees that it would not be attacked by Israel.\n\nSanam Vakil, director of the Middle East programme at Chatham House, said Tehran needed to entice Trump into a deal quickly if it was to avoid more US \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d and the threat of further Israeli strikes.\n\n\u201cWithout offering something bigger, they risk a third round of strikes from Israel that will be supported by this US administration,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is the viability of the regime. The economic viability of the regime and their ability to rehabilitate themselves and build back legitimacy.\u201d", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b541826e-ab90-4b4d-b81c-fcecf3eea56f"}}, {"id": "a076ee0f-220c-4043-8648-97d03c0d157c", "event_name": "DeepSeek and the dollar are spoiling \u2018Trump trades\u2019 ", "blurb": "If it turns out the moat around US tech stocks is not as deep as investors had hoped, the AI fairytale will unravel", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Hours ahead of the reinauguration of Donald Trump as US president last week, Goldman Sachs hosted its annual investment summit in its London office, and one big so-called Trump trade kept on cropping up: the dollar.\n\nThe new US president\u2019s economic policy platform remains tough to parse or predict in any kind of detail. But investors, especially speculative hedge funds, have been pretty settled on the idea that Trump means a strong buck \u2014 the result of American exceptionalism, stubborn inflation, or both.\n\nFor many clients it is, as one of the bank\u2019s most senior traders outlined to the assembled fund managers, \u201cthe most obvious trade in the world\u201d, especially in relation to the Chinese renminbi.\n\nLater that same day, Trump made his way back to the White House. On his way, at the inauguration ceremony, he returned to his precious topic of tariffs \u2014 one of the key policies that snagged him his historic election victory. This time, however, it came with one big problem for the \u201cobvious\u201d trade: Trump directed his toughest intentions at Mexico and Canada, not China, which he has previously suggested was the main target.\n\nCue a sizeable jump in the Chinese currency that has fuelled a drag on the dollar across the board. The euro, sterling and yen have all picked up from recent lows \u2014 an alarming development for dollar bulls.\n\nThis is far from the only supposedly slam-dunk strategy for the president\u2019s second stint in the White House that has run into early trouble.\n\nThe message in the run-up to the reinauguration of Donald Trump has been that his zeal for deregulation, low taxes and American goods for American consumers all add up to a strong positive case for buying and holding US stocks in preference to the rest of the world. The icing on the cake is the artificial intelligence revolution, forged in the US and dominated by US-listed companies. Some investors see it as not just a commercial imperative but a strategic geopolitical imperative to stick as closely as possible to this theme.\n\nThen came the latest market shock: the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese challenge to US hubris in artificial intelligence. This took a little while to really get on to investors\u2019 radar. But at the start of this week, it did so with a bang, sending US tech stocks sliding fast. The market value of Nvidia alone sank by more than $600bn \u2014 an unprecedented daily drop for a single company. Remember: just seven AI-adjacent US stocks account for fully one-third of the entire S&P 500 benchmark index of US equities. If it turns out that the moat around them, and particularly around chipmaker Nvidia, is not as wide or as deep as investors had hoped, this whole fairytale starts to unravel.\n\nFrench bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale points out that without Nvidia and its top four customers \u2014 Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta \u2014 the entire US benchmark index would be some 12 per cent below where it is today. With \u201cAmerican exceptionalism in full force\u201d, as Manish Kabra, head of US equity strategy at the bank put it, it is little wonder that broad US markets are feeling the pain. Tilting towards an equal-weighted S&P 500, rather than the standard version favouring monster-size tech stocks, makes sense here, he added.\n\nIgnoring markets outside the US is also unwise. The main stocks indices in Germany and the UK have struck new record highs since Trump took office. There is life in the rest of the world after all. But any challenge to US Big Tech has the power to be seriously destabilising for all markets.\n\nA stumbling dollar and unusually wobbly US stocks are an ugly blow for anyone who expected this to be an easy ride, and a painful reminder that when it comes to managing money in the era of Trump 2.0, no one really knows anything. Whether you are a hedge fund manager or a have-a-go amateur investor, in this environment, you stick to your convictions at your peril.\n\nUS Big Tech, a powerful dollar and US dominance over puny overseas stock markets were all a nice, neat, satisfying story to accompany the new Trump era, and investors of all stripes embraced it with great vigour. \u201cOther than the almighty, who has achieved more in seven days than [president] Trump?\u201d fawned investor Bill Ackman in an X post over the weekend.\n\nSuch cringe-inducing hyperbole is tough to stomach, but it is a timely prompt to consider what the chosen one will do in the next seven days, and the seven days after that, and whether your portfolio of \u201cobvious\u201d Trump trades can handle the pain.\n\nkatie.martin@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b96f6962-3c2b-4bcf-96c1-4cf5fd08bfdd"}}, {"id": "331b1a00-fb6b-4821-b175-3cd9491c8f5b", "event_name": "EU and Nato take vow of silence on Greenland", "blurb": "Denmark urges other European capitals to resist reacting to Donald Trump\u2019s threats", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "The EU and Nato have taken a vow of silence over Greenland after Denmark requested its allies refrain from reacting to Donald Trump\u2019s threats to seize the Arctic island.\n\nCopenhagen\u2019s strategy of avoiding public confrontation with Trump, which four officials said was closely co-ordinated with Nato and the EU, underscores the scramble among US allies to work out how to handle the US president\u2019s pugnacious diplomacy.\n\nTrump had a fiery 45-minute phone call with Denmark\u2019s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen last week, putting Copenhagen into what officials described as \u201ccrisis mode\u201d. Trump has threatened to target tariffs against Denmark and has refused to rule out taking the Arctic island by force.\n\nTrump reiterated this weekend that he \u201cwill get\u201d Greenland \u2014 an autonomous part of the kingdom of Denmark \u2014 while mocking Copenhagen\u2019s \u201cdog sleighs\u201d defending the island, where the US has the biggest military presence.\n\nThe US, through Nato, is a military ally of Denmark with a mutual defence agreement. The EU\u2019s governing treaty also contains a mutual defence clause.\n\nDanish and European officials had initially hoped Trump\u2019s comments about taking Greenland were a tactic to gain more influence over the territory, which has increased in importance as Russia and China seek more influence in the Arctic.\n\nOfficials in recent days realised the situation \u201cshould be taken far more seriously\u201d, said one, given the global implications of Nato or the EU failing to condemn a violation of national sovereignty by one of their allies.\n\nBut Danish, EU and Nato officials have so far decided to minimise public discussion because of Copenhagen\u2019s deep sensitivities and its conclusion that openly challenging Trump will only exacerbate the crisis.\n\n\u201cA low profile seems to be the safest bet with Trump. Hopefully he will be distracted by something else,\u201d said one senior European official.\n\nAnother senior EU official said: \u201cWe believe a tit for tat approach is not useful.

There have also been no efforts to co-ordinate Nato or EU statements in defence of Denmark or Greenland.\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s Greenland comments, Rutte told the European parliament last week: \u201cTrump has been right many times\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we need to dialogue with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not about who rules or controls Greenland,\u201d Rutte continued. \u201cThis is, of course, about making sure that the Arctic stays safe.\u201d Neither the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, nor European Council president Ant\u00f3nio Costa have made public statements regarding Trump\u2019s threats against Denmark.\n\n\u201cWe are not negotiating Greenland.

We live in a world of network effects and increasing returns to scale. In industries from PC software (Microsoft), internet search (Alphabet), online retail (Amazon) and social media (Meta) to high-end consumer hardware (Apple), most of the profits and market share have gone to one company. It is only a moderate exaggeration to say all that has mattered for investors in the past few decades was being on the right side of one or more of these winner-take-all stories.\n\nSo it is natural that everyone either has assumed, desired or feared that the next great technology trend, artificial intelligence, would have roughly this economic structure. What happened in markets yesterday was not an out-of-nowhere surprise, nor a panic, nor a bubble popping. It was the pricing in of slightly higher odds that AI is not a winner-take-all game.\n\nIt was always conceivable that the AI revolution would be like the invention of the automobile or the aeroplane. Those revolutions did lead to the creation of huge, durably profitable companies, but also lots of competition, ensuring that much of the value created went to consumers rather than shareholders. Now that looks like a more significant possibility for AI.\n\nMost readers will know the news by now. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, has released an AI model called R1, that is comparable in ability to the best models from companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta, but was trained at a radically lower cost and using less than state-of-the art GPU chips. DeepSeek also made enough of the details of the model public that others can run it on their own computers (but not necessarily enough that others could re-create it).\n\nThis puts three punctures in the winner-take-all theory of AI. It deflates the idea that the best AI results could only be achieved with Nvidia\u2019s best chips and software; the idea that only the biggest tech companies could afford to build and run high-quality AI models; and the idea that only companies with their own AI models could offer great AI applications.\n\nWhat kept Nvidia\u2019s stock rocketing for the past two years was sheer computational superiority. Its chips were miles better for AI. DeepSeek built R1 with Nvidia\u2019s older, slower chips, which US sanctions allow to be exported to China. This suggests the door is open to other competitors at the silicon level.\n\nNext, cost. The biggest tech companies looked more or less insulated from competition on AI because, it was assumed, the only way to build a better AI model was to train it with more inputs using more computing power, at huge expense. The finished model would then be under the control of the big company that built it. The barrier to entry was money \u2014 that is why Big Tech has gone on a data centre spending spree. But R1 suggests that companies with less money can soon operate competitive models.\n\nFinally, applications. \u201cInference\u201d is where the user really meets AI: questions answered, tasks completed. It was assumed that any application would depend on the bigger companies\u2019 models and servers for inference. But models like R1 might work well enough, and do inference efficiently enough, to run on the servers of all sorts of companies that will not need to \u201crent\u201d from a company such as OpenAI.\n\nAll this has big implications. But other than Nvidia, the big fallers yesterday were not the Magnificent Seven Big Techs. Those companies\u2019 AI halos remain squarely in place. The real damage was done to the stocks behind the emerging data centre economy. Constellation, the utility company that covers the mid-Atlantic data centre hub, Vistra, Washington state\u2019s big power provider, and NRG, the Northeast\u2019s and Texas\u2019 main player, all fell hard:\n\nGE Vernova, Eaton and Quanta Services build power systems for data centres. Oracle just announced a big data centre investment. Broadcom and Arista provide non-GPU technology to data centres.\u00a0All were whacked:\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft have all invested very heavily in AI data centres. Perhaps they have wasted some of that money \u2014 but they could be free to spend less now. Apple and Microsoft, whose natural strength might have been in building applications for AI models rather than the models themselves, could even be in a better position.\n\nNvidia itself is hardly on its knees. Its proprietary coding language, Cuda, is still the industry standard. And just because the DeepSeek model is more efficient does not mean that leaner models will not benefit from the higher computational power offered by Nvidia\u2019s best chips. While its shares dropped nearly 17 per cent yesterday, that only brings it back to the (very, very high) level of September:\n\nWe should not overstate the market\u2019s reaction to R1. The Nasdaq fell 3 per cent. That was a bad day, not a panic. The winner-take-all view of AI is wounded, not dead. The AI bubble, if that\u2019s what it is, may yet pop, but it didn\u2019t pop yesterday. Not even close.\n\nMisplaced hope.\n\nrobert.armstrong@ft.com and aiden.reiter@ft.com.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/98e55df3-9da8-467c-950d-b469ad2ea621"}}, {"id": "02f0ccd9-bff9-4fef-8eda-222234524aff", "event_name": "Wall Street\u2019s AI \u2018bubble\u2019 echoes dotcom excesses, Ray Dalio warns", "blurb": "Billionaire investor says US stocks are in \u2018very similar\u2019 position as lead-up to internet bust at turn of millennium ", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Investor exuberance over artificial intelligence has fuelled a \u201cbubble\u201d in US stocks that resembles the build-up to the dotcom bust at the turn of the millennium, billionaire investor Ray Dalio has warned.\n\nDalio told the Financial Times that \u201cpricing has got to levels which are high at the same time as there\u2019s an interest rate risk, and that combination could prick the bubble\u201d.\n\nThe warning from Dalio, the founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and one of the highest-profile figures on Wall Street, comes as concerns swirl over whether the boom in US AI stocks has gone too far.

The index has doubled since the beginning of 2023 as stocks such as AI-focused chipmaker Nvidia have powered higher.\n\nWall Street stocks slumped on Monday after DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company linked to a little-known hedge fund, published a paper claiming its newest AI model rivals those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms in performance, yet at a lower cost and with less sophisticated hardware. Nvidia shed nearly $600bn in market value on Monday.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s apparent success calls into question the potential returns on hundreds of billions of dollars invested by Silicon Valley companies in AI data centres, and whether China has managed to find a way to compete despite restrictions on its ability to import high-end chips from the US.\n\nOpenAI, backed by Microsoft, last week announced a plan to invest up to $500bn in AI infrastructure.

US President Donald Trump said DeepSeek \u201cshould be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser focused on competing to win\u201d.\n\nIn December, DeepSeek released the V3 model, which it claimed was comparable to ones from OpenAI and Google, but trained it on a fraction of the budget with $5.6mn. The Chinese company said it used just 2,048 Nvidia chips, which could have been obtained without breaching US export controls that have throttled China\u2019s access to US chipmakers\u2019 latest products.\n\nThen, last week, it unveiled its latest R1 model, a \u201creasoning model\u201d that is comparable to OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nFurther spooking investors, DeepSeek\u2019s engineers were able to unlock greater performance by writing code without relying on Nvidia\u2019s Cuda software platform, which is widely seen as crucial to the Silicon Valley chipmaker\u2019s dominance of AI development.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek has levelled the playing field,\u201d said Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer of Blue Whale Growth, the investment fund backed by billionaire Peter Hargreaves, which last month reduced its exposure to the Magnificent Seven group of big US tech companies on concerns over their huge expenditure on AI.\n\nThe biggest US tech companies \u201chave had monopoly access to AI \u2014 the entry ticket price was in the billions of dollars, otherwise there was no chance you could challenge the status quo\u201d, Yiu said. That made DeepSeek\u2019s arrival a \u201cvery positive development for the adoption, development and penetration of AI\u201d, he added.\n\nShort sellers, who have placed a flurry of bets against Nvidia\u2019s sky-high share price in recent weeks, were jubilant on Monday. Nvidia\u2019s 17 per cent share price decline generated $6.75bn in profits for short sellers, according to calculations by data group S3 Partners.\n\n\u201cA Chinese entity put out open-sourced code right before earnings of all the big American tech companies,\u201d said one short seller with interests in a number of large AI companies. \u201cThey\u2019re telling you there\u2019s no value [in those companies\u2019 AI models], it\u2019s commoditised.\u201d\n\nHowever, some analysts have challenged the idea that DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough AI was so cheap to build.\n\nDylan Patel of chip consultancy SemiAnalysis has estimated that DeepSeek and its sister company, the hedge fund High-Flyer, have access to tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, which were used to train R1\u2019s predecessors.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek has spent well over $500mn on GPUs over the history of the company,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWhile their training run was very efficient, it required significant experimentation and testing to work.\u201d\n\nG Dan Hutcheson at TechInsights said the market reaction did not reflect who was most exposed to DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a big hit to Nvidia, I see it as a bigger problem for the companies like OpenAI that are trying to sell these services,\u201d he said.\n\nNvidia argued on Monday that DeepSeek\u2019s innovations would benefit, not blow up, its business.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,\u201d Nvidia said, referring to AI systems that consume more computing resources after a user poses a question or sets a task by \u201creasoning\u201d or taking multiple linked steps to respond. \u201cInference requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.\u201d\n\nThe implication of Nvidia\u2019s statement is that by pushing the boundaries of what is possible with \u201copen-source\u201d AI models, DeepSeek has in fact grown demand for the chips that are used to run them.\n\nWhile Nvidia is best known for providing the chips that are used to \u201ctrain\u201d or build a new AI system, it has said that it now generates just as much revenue from chips for \u201cinference\u201d or processing user requests using a finished model.\n\nHuang argued on a recent podcast that demand for inference \u201cis about to go up by a billion times\u201d due to new AI models that \u201creason\u201d or take time to plan and deliver an answer to a complex query.\n\n\u201cThere are two uses for Nvidia chips, training and inference, and we\u2019re just at the beginning of the inference story,\u201d said Jordan Jacobs, co-founder of AI investor Radical Ventures, who bought more Nvidia shares on Monday as the chipmaker\u2019s stock slumped 17 per cent. \u201cAs we see the world shifting to AI it requires a huge upgrade in chips. The sell-off seems to be an overreaction and a lack of understanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe market is not properly realising this is great for Nvidia,\u201d said Dmitry Shevelenko, chief business officer at Perplexity, the San Francisco-based AI search start-up that counts the chipmaker among its investors. \u201cNo matter what, Jensen wins.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Cristina Criddle in San Francisco and Eleanor Olcott in Beijing", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ee83c24c-9099-42a4-85c9-165e7af35105"}}, {"id": "a5c1172f-808e-4587-8a19-b4ccc629a11e", "event_name": "Pirates, wolf howls and roller-skates: New York\u2019s reimagined tiki bars ", "blurb": "The mid-century kitsch fest is back \u2014 but this time mainly shorn of its more problematic aspects", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "This article is part of FT Globetrotter\u2019s guide to New York\n\nIt\u2019s Friday night in New York City\u2019s East Village. In the 1970s, the neighbourhood was the epicentre of punk. Now, though, it\u2019s known for its urban sangfroid and urbane sophistication. Everyone is cool; maybe too cool. But inside Paradise Lost, a waiter is lighting a cocktail on fire for a table of ogling carousers. The lights flicker purple and white. The music cuts out and is replaced by a soundtrack of wolves howling and chains jangling. The waiters howl. The patrons howl. Chill this is not.\n\nParadise Lost (see below) is the latest addition to New York\u2019s new breed of tiki bars \u2014 and one of the best. As far as bar subcultures go, tiki has had a wild ride. The first tiki bar, Don the Beachcomber, was opened in 1933 in California by Ernest Gantt, a man who later renamed himself Donn Beach. He created the archetypal tiki bar: an archly kitsch pastiche of exotic influences where images of Polynesian gods and half-clad Hawaiian women in leis complemented fusion food and intricate, often rum-based cocktails, served with maximal garnish in mugs designed to look like Moai statues. The trend reached its peak in the postwar years, partially as an antidote to the uptight Eisenhower administration. But by the 1990s, the incipient awareness that tiki was, in fact, a species of cultural appropriation based on colonialism, racism and sexism, helped kill the vibe.\n\nRecently, though, bars such as Paradise Lost have tried to redefine tiki, steering clear of its troubled past while preserving the fun. As it turns out, there are many ways to go over the top. Not all are queasily fetishising. And now, when the real world is so chaotic, there can be no better time to escape into a lush, rum-powered fantasy.\n\nA flight above one of Brooklyn\u2019s best steakhouses, Gage & Tollner, its co-owner St John Frizell has carved out a pirate ship\u2019s cabin. A watery view is glimpsed from a portal; fish glisten, mid-swim, mounted on dark wood walls. Sunken Harbor is the tiki bar grown up. Sure, the lights are dim but the vibe skews heavily nautical. In fact, the space is built slightly askew to better mimic a keeling cabin.\n\nThe complex cocktails are inspired by mid-century food and drink writer Charles H Baker and are organised by strength, from In the Shadows (\u201ceasy-drinking cocktails for a pleasant moonlight swim\u201d) to The Abyss (maniacally strong and includes the Shattered Skull, a combination of rums, pomegranate, vanilla and pineapple that serves two). For tiki enthusiasts there\u2019s even a passport membership, with 36 pages of challenges.\n\n\u201cI wanted to preserve the idea that you are toying with mystical forces but without appropriating Polynesian gods,\u201d says co-owner Kav\u00e9 Pourzanjani of Paradise Lost, which opened in 2023. \u201cI settled on demonology.\u201d The effect is more Mondo Cane than Charles Manson. Pourzanjani combines elements of B-movie horror, Ed Roth\u2019s Rat Fink cartoon culture of the 1980s and DC comics. The ceiling is a fish net cluttered with ocean detritus: licence plates and model aeroplanes.\n\nThe menu, meanwhile, is almost as long as a Milton poem, and littered with illustrations of zombies. The drinks are elaborate concoctions, rated by skulls (strength), such as the Tarman, which includes three rums, falernum, cinnamon and grenadine, and Witches\u2019 Sabbath (rums, brandy, gins, tropical juices, citrus and falernum), the ordering of which triggers the flashing lights and lupine howls.\n\nDeep in Bushwick, the 16,000-square-foot Xanadu is, as one might imagine, de trop. It\u2019s a hipster pleasure dome with a roller-skating rink, tiered seats, a DJ, a state of the art sound system and a disco in the bathroom. The carpet alone, a fiesta of neon swoops, is visual overload. The endless circumambulations of the patrons are powered by tiki drinks from poet-bartender Keri Marinda Smith, whose most recent collection is called Dragging Anchor. Smith\u2019s drinks recall tropical classics: the Ladybug daiquiri, Cherry Baby (amaretto, cognac, blackcurrant and cherry) and Skaterade, a tequila-forward riff on Gatorade with blue spirulina. But beware, skating patrons have a two-drink limit.\n\nIn 2008, when Roberta\u2019s started, the now-iconic pizzeria was a punky DIY affair in an old warehouse in the then terra incognita of Bushwick. Its adjoining tiki bar was a step up from the Pabst Blue Ribbon lager and other watery domestic beers favoured by early-adopting hipsters. Now, Roberta\u2019s is an empire, with locations in Manhattan, Los Angeles, Denver, Singapore and beyond. But that no-big-deal nonchalance lives on in the original location\u2019s tiki bar. Design-wise, the tiki influence is light, though the drinks aren\u2019t. Among the crop of brightly coloured tiki riffs are the Marg Boi, made with tequila, triple sec and lime; the Young Money Melonaire (rum, Ancho\u00a0Reyes, spicy poblano, melon and Campari); and the A$AP Wa$$ail, a wintry concoction of habanero tequila and pineapple with cherry liqueur and spiced cider.\n\nPerhaps the oldest of the city\u2019s extant tiki bars, Otto\u2019s Shrunken Head opened in a former pharmacy in 2002. Once the block was peppered with bars \u2014 Irish, dive, karaoke \u2014 but now it\u2019s been given over to Target and other big box stores. Otto\u2019s, though, has survived. The small bar is illuminated by holiday lights year round, the walls are covered in sisal and the drinks are classic tiki: Mai Tais, Singapore Slings and Zombies. Just a few booths and stools, a photo booth (out of order since forever) and a video game (Big Buck Hunter II: Sportsman\u2019s Paradise) round out the feeling of a slightly dilapidated island outpost from another place and another time.\n\nHave you tried NYC\u2019s new wave of tiki bars?

I said, \u2018I disagree,\u2019\u201d he told supporters on inauguration day, arguing that immigration was a more pressing issue.\n\n\u201cIf you really thought this guy was going to do something about the price of eggs, then you are probably going to be brutally disappointed,\u201d said Mark Blyth, a professor at Brown University and the author of Inflation: A Guide For Users And Losers. \u201c[His stance is] \u2018We can\u2019t give you cheap groceries, but we can give you the Gulf of America\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Fed also thinks inflation under Trump will be stronger than it previously anticipated. Its quarterly \u201cdot-plot\u201d forecasts for December show rate-setters expected prices to rise by 2.5 per cent over the course of 2025, against an estimate of 2.2 per cent in September, before Trump was elected.\n\nThe central bank is almost certain to maintain interest rates at the target range of 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent at its vote on Wednesday, and the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets US borrowing costs, is expected to make just two quarter-point rate cuts this year.\n\nIf borrowing costs do not fall fast, then fresh conflict between Fed chair Jay Powell and the president looks likely.\n\n\u201cTrump said in Davos that interest rates are going to be lower\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009he didn\u2019t say Jerome Powell better lower them, but it wasn\u2019t very disguised,\u201d said Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and chief economic policy adviser to former Republican Senator John McCain. \u201cAnd I think the Fed\u2019s unlikely to do anything but keep interest rates on hold.\u201d\n\nChief among economists\u2019 concerns is that the effect of a post-pandemic immigration boom in helping reduce inflation will go into reverse under Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nThe president\u2019s promises to tighten border restriction, and round up and deport millions of undocumented migrants, are expected to leave construction groups across the country, and agribusinesses in south-western states, struggling to find workers.\n\n\u201cRegardless of where you stand on US immigration policy, there are a fair amount of workers in the construction industry that are illegal immigrants,\u201d said Sherwin Loudermilk, president of Loudermilk Homes, an Atlanta-based real estate developer. \u201cIf Trump has mass deportations, or people get scared, then there\u2019s going to be a void.\u201d\n\nWorker shortages usually raise wages, feeding into broader price pressures \u2014 although they could also lead to more investment in labour-saving technology, potentially enhancing productivity.\n\n\u201cTwo things could save us from inflation \u2014 one is we just get an AI productivity miracle sooner than we think, and that outweighs the other stuff,\u201d said Posen. \u201cThe other is that we get extremely unprecedented benefits from a stronger dollar.\u201d\n\nWhile a stronger dollar lowers import prices, any benefit for US consumers could be offset by higher tariffs.\n\nDivisions between moderates, such as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, and hawks, such as senior economic adviser Peter Navarro, make it difficult to predict what the president will do.\n\nOn the campaign trail Trump threatened to impose blanket levies of 10-20 per cent on all US imports. While that would raise prices, the impact might be shortlived, as long as other jurisdictions did not respond in kind.\n\n\u201cJust to put the numbers into perspective, a broad 10 per cent tariff on all US imports would raise the price level by 1 per cent,\u201d said Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Yale and former adviser to Biden, who added that such a rise would be a one-off shock that the Fed \u201cwould probably look through\u201d.\n\nOthers think aggressive action by Trump on trade could delay the reduction of interest rates.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t cut the rate while a tariff is going up,\u201d said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Investments, who expects the next Fed cut to come in June.\n\nShould Trump press ahead with plans to impose a 25 per cent levy on his southern neighbour, US citrus and vegetable agribusinesses, many of which have interests in Mexico, would need to pass on costs to customers.\n\nTrump\u2019s plans to cut taxes have also led to concerns that he risks repeating Biden\u2019s mistakes by contributing to the country\u2019s yawning fiscal deficit and stoking inflation.\n\n\u201cThere is one narrative that says US inflation was all down to the [2021] fiscal stimulus, that Biden was responsible because he spent too much on the Covid recovery,\u201d said Nicol\u00f2 Fraccaroli, a visiting scholar at Brown University, although he added that while the spending was not the only source of price pressures, it did contribute \u201ca little bit\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s big hope for lowering inflation lies in tearing up red tape. But economists and businesses believe there are limits to how much this can cut costs for households and businesses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some recent evidence that deregulation boosts growth,\u201d said Sanjay Patnaik, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think-tank. \u201cBut with inflation, at least to my knowledge, there isn\u2019t much research that paints a clear line.\n\n\u201cIt really depends on the type of regulations you\u2019re looking at,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump has directed his cabinet to \u201cmarshall all powers at their disposal\u201d to ease rules that will help tackle the soaring cost of living \u2014\u00a0including the high cost of housing.\n\nBut while construction businesses and economists widely share the president\u2019s view that America needs more affordable homes, they are not convinced his plans to loosen regulations to tackle supply shortages will solve the problem.\n\n\u201cRegulations and making it easier to get permits is important, but obviously the number one thing is interest rates,\u201d said Loudermilk.\n\nHigh borrowing costs have also meant Americans are reluctant to move, leading to further shortfalls in supply.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to refinance from a 3 per cent mortgage to 7 per cent,\u201d said Mahmood Pradhan, economist at Amundi. \u201cThose costs are going to be the prevailing factor that restrains the housing market, not regulation.\u201d\n\nTrump has claimed his biggest deregulatory push \u2014 declaring a national energy emergency to increase domestic oil and gas production \u2014 will lower the cost of all goods and services.\n\nBut weak global demand and market caution could deter investment in additional supply.\n\n\u201cThe oil and gas industry is reluctant to produce more than global markets can absorb right now. Precisely because they know that will cause commodity prices to drop sharply,\u201d said James Lucier, managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, adding that there was \u201cquite a lot of market discipline\u201d constraining fresh drilling.\n\nAdditional reporting by Valentina Romei in London", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b3d310d0-80a8-472f-a79e-8e01c2c60cfa"}}, {"id": "733d6877-bd09-420e-8a8f-d2b7f02240bb", "event_name": "Scott Bessent pushes gradual 2.5% universal US tariffs plan", "blurb": "Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary wants levies to rise month by month in order to give businesses time to adjust", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Donald Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary Scott Bessent is pushing for new universal tariffs on US imports to start at 2.5 per cent and rise gradually, said four people familiar with the proposal.\n\nThe 2.5 per cent levy would move higher by the same amount each month, the people familiar with it said, giving businesses time to adjust and countries the chance to negotiate with the US president\u2019s administration.\n\nThe levies could be pushed up to as high as 20 per cent \u2014 in line with Trump\u2019s maximalist position on the campaign trail last year. But a gradual introduction would be more moderate than the immediate action some countries feared.\n\nThe proposal by Bessent comes as Trump\u2019s team debates how to implement tariff plans, with the president escalating his tariff rhetoric on Monday in a speech in Florida, threatening more duties on semiconductors, metals and pharmaceutical goods.\n\n\u201cWe have to bring production back to our country,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president was speaking after a day of turmoil in US stock markets, triggered by a tech sell-off as China appeared to make a leap ahead of the US in the global artificial intelligence race.His threat to impose tariffs on semiconductors entering the US would be difficult to carry out given the impact on tech companies relying on chipmakers such as Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. In contrast, Bessent\u2019s plan would see just 2.5 per cent added to tariffs each month. Two people familiar with the discussions said it was unclear if the Treasury secretary had convinced other central stakeholders, including Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s pick for commerce secretary, to adopt his proposal for a gradual introduction of tariffs.\n\nA person familiar with Bessent\u2019s thinking declined to comment on the record about the proposal, but said: \u201cHe is not drawing up any plans but if confirmed looks forward to being a part of the conversation.\u201d\n\nBessent was comfortably confirmed as the next US Treasury secretary by a Senate vote of 68-29 on Monday evening. Just hours later, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said he wanted \u201cmuch, much bigger\u201d tariffs than 2.5 per cent.\n\nTariff policy is at the centre of fierce trade debates between hawks such as Peter Navarro and Jamieson Greer, and moderates such as Bessent.\n\nTrump has threatened to force tariffs of up to 25 per cent on imports from Canada and Mexico as soon as this weekend, and in recent days threatened Colombia with 25 per cent tariffs in a dispute over deportees.\n\nAnother person familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking said he was weighing different options. \u201cThere is not a single plan the president is ready to decide on yet.\u201d\n\nWhile Bessent and other proponents of the low initial tariff believe it would give countries and companies time to adjust and negotiate, critics counter that a higher initial rate would send a clearer message.\n\nTrump made high tariffs a core of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign rhetoric last year, vowing in September to \u201ctax\u201d foreign nations \u201cat levels that they\u2019re not used to\u201d.\n\nBut since his inauguration on January 20, the president\u2019s main move has been to publish a memorandum outlining probes into US trade policy, the cause of the country\u2019s trade deficits and whether competitors are manipulating currencies and unfairly taxing US businesses.\n\nWhen asked by reporters last week whether he planned to introduce universal tariffs, Trump replied: \u201cWe may. But we\u2019re not ready for that yet.\u201d\n\nTrade analysts and lawyers have said Trump could levy universal tariffs swiftly by using executive powers such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to respond to emergencies through economic means.\n\nHowever, trade experts have also warned the use of IEEPA to issue broad tariffs would likely face legal challenges by business groups.\n\nTrump, who has long railed against the US\u2019s trade deficit, has suggested tariffs would be a way to raise revenue for the country.\n\n\u201cInstead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,\u201d he said in his inaugural address.\n\nIn his US Senate confirmation hearings last week, Bessent said the Trump administration would use tariffs to tackle unfair trade practices, raise US government revenues, and strike deals with foreign countries.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by Myles McCormick in Washington", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7fb420b9-1bd1-4c68-8575-94e99315051c"}}, {"id": "5297d357-abb0-4813-9886-1433441a1b0f", "event_name": "Judgment Day for the AI rally", "blurb": "Machine God has forsaken the US stock market ", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "Here\u2019s a parable:\n\nA powerful king decided he wanted to make a Machine God that would be omniscient and omnipotent. After lots of experimentation, the king started to make progress. Miracles started to occur. People feared that this Machine God would be unmerciful and make humanity irrelevant, or possibly end all life entirely.\n\nThe early successes only made the king more radical, however, and fuelled his obsession. Huge amounts of time, energy and ideas were sacrificed in hopes of the wealth and prosperity the Machine God could bring.\n\nAnother king nearby was working on a Machine God of his own. But he decided omniscience and omnipotence weren\u2019t his goal. Instead he wanted to make a Lesser Deity that could perform miracles that would be similar to Machine God, but without its ravenous hunger for sacrifice.\n\nOnce the Lesser Deity was unveiled, the Machine God\u2019s people were very displeased. Why, they wondered, did they sacrifice so much to try to create a potentially apocalyptic and cruel Machine God \u2014 who still doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 when benefits could easily be reaped with less sacrifice?\n\nAt the very least, today\u2019s sell-off in Big Tech could be described as a biblical reckoning. Beyond that, there\u2019s a lesson about the type of market and economic environment that creates these types of God-sized ambitions.\n\nNvidia is on track to set a record for the biggest single-day market cap loss in US history:\n\nFor readers who haven\u2019t guessed yet, the parable was meant to contrast the US\u2019s efforts to develop artificial intelligence \u2014 and its discussion of \u201cArtificial General Intelligence\u201d at whatever cost \u2014 with those of Chinese start-up DeepSeek.\n\nOne could argue that all of this could\u2019ve been avoided by simply not promoting the idea of a maximalist Machine God. But financial markets were yearning for salvation, and there were holes in the bullish narrative that could only be filled by Machine God itself.\n\nTake commercial property markets. The slump in office occupancy freaked out investors in office properties (and even bank bonds) and decimated downtowns. But the data-centre boom was a bright spot in the broader market, as plenty of analysts pointed out at the time.\n\nCorporate profits? Well, as our pals at Unhedged very sharply pointed out this month, the recipients of capex dollars get cash today, while the expenses are booked over time. That means that, in effect, a bunch of money is flying around today that doesn\u2019t take a bite out of megacap profits until later.\n\nAnd broadly, stocks have been pricey. Last Friday, before the DeepSeek market meltdown, the S&P 500 was trading at 28 times last year\u2019s earnings, according to FactSet, well above the long-term average of 18. The market has largely been driven by the biggest companies in the US (the Magnificent 7, as they\u2019ve been named).

Schneider Electric, a French maker\u00a0of electrical power products\u00a0that has invested heavily in services for data centres, fell 9.5 per cent.\n\nTraders sought shelter in perceived havens, with shares in consumer staples companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, General Mills and Hershey posting solid gains on Monday.\n\nApple, which is viewed as less exposed to the AI race than many Big Tech rivals, gained 3.3 per cent.\n\nTo some, the sell-off in the companies making the \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d of the AI revolution echoed the share-price crash of IT hardware company Cisco when the dotcom bubble burst.\n\nNvidia, Broadcom and other chipmakers have benefited from Silicon Valley\u2019s race to build ever-larger clusters of chips, which the likes of xAI boss Elon Musk and OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman have argued are needed to keep advancing AI\u2019s capabilities.\n\nNvidia\u2019s chief executive Jensen Huang and Broadcom\u2019s Hock Tan have argued in recent weeks that they expected the data centre building frenzy to continue until the end of the decade.\n\n\u201cIt shows how vulnerable the AI trade still is, like every trade that is consensus and based on the assumption of an unassailable lead,\u201d said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management.\n\nBut some Wall Street analysts and AI researchers have questioned the hype surrounding DeepSeek\u2019s achievement. \u201cIt seems categorically false that \u2018China duplicated OpenAI for $5M\u2019 and we don\u2019t think it really bears further discussion,\u201d wrote analysts at Bernstein in a note to clients.\n\nSome researchers have even speculated that DeepSeek was able to take shortcuts in its own training costs by leveraging the latest models from OpenAI, suggesting that while it has been able to replicate the latest US developments very quickly, it will be harder for the Chinese company to pull ahead.\n\nAI investment by large-cap US tech companies hit $224bn last year, according to UBS, which expects the total to reach $280bn in 2025.

All three voted against Trump\u2019s defence secretary nominee Pete Hegseth last week when he secured Senate confirmation with just a single tiebreaking vote cast by vice-president JD Vance.\n\nBut Kennedy\u2019s support for abortion rights and his push to shake up the food industry and biomedical research funding were also potential sources of Republican opposition, people in his camp acknowledged.\n\nAnti-abortion senators, including James Lankford; Republican senators, such as Todd Young and Thom Tillis, who are historically close to the pharmaceutical industry; and those with a large agricultural industry in their states, such as John Hoeven, were risks for Kennedy, the people said.\n\nA spokesperson for Young said the Indiana senator had a \u201cvery positive\u201d meeting with Kennedy in December. Representatives for the others did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cThese are the most consequential confirmation hearings for any [Health and Human Services] secretary we have probably seen in many decades,\u201d said Meekins.\n\nKennedy, a vocal vaccine sceptic and critic of the pharmaceutical industry, would control a sprawling department with 13 divisions and agencies and a budget of $1.8tn if he was confirmed.\n\nA representative for Kennedy said they had \u201cfull confidence\u201d that he would win the Senate vote.\n\nPrediction market Polymarket gives Kennedy an 80 per cent chance of being confirmed, compared with almost 100 per cent for nominees such as Scott Bessent, Trump\u2019s pick for Treasury secretary. Tulsi Gabbard, his nominee as intelligence director, was on just 51 per cent.\n\nKennedy has stirred controversy for his previous opposition to some childhood vaccines, MMR shots and the Covid-19 jab, although he has softened those positions to curry favour with senators.\n\nHe also earned $11.6mn from vaccine lawsuits over the past two years and has said he would keep a 10 per cent stake in any windfall from litigation against Merck\u2019s Gardasil vaccine. One of his closest advisers \u2014 lawyer Aaron Siri \u2014 also led a lawsuit trying to revoke the most widely used polio vaccine.\n\nMcConnell, a polio survivor, has taken issue with Kennedy\u2019s antivax comments, warning in December that undermining confidence in \u201cproven cures\u201d was \u201cdangerous\u201d.

Neither senator responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe weeklong delay to Kennedy\u2019s Senate hearings also pointed to some concerns that he did not have enough support, Washington insiders noted.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s all kumbaya, it\u2019s in your incentive to push ahead with the hearings.

From the flurry of executive orders to the raft of state-led lawsuits challenging them, it\u2019s predictably difficult to keep up with what the president is doing. But if you listen carefully, there is signal in the noise. Here are my three leading indicators about what to expect from Donald Trump\u2019s second administration based on his first week in office.\n\nCEOs are stepping over themselves to fall in line with Trump, not only because they like his tax cuts and deregulation agenda, but also because he\u2019s making it clear that he\u2019ll come after them personally if they don\u2019t. Before inauguration, when asked whether he thought Mark Zuckerberg had ditched independent fact-checking at Meta because of Trump\u2019s threats to put him in jail, he gloated, \u201cProbably.\u201d Let\u2019s think about that for a minute. We now have an American president who openly admits that he\u2019s using the power of his office to coerce business leaders. What\u2019s the difference between this and what provincial Chinese governors do when they shake down rich entrepreneurs for more tax money?\n\nTrump doubled down on the personal attacks in his remarks to the World Economic Forum in Davos last week when he told Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan onstage that he\u2019d better start doing more lending to conservatives, or else. In response, Moynihan took the sycophantic approach and tried to joke with Trump about their mutual CEO friends attending the forum. I don\u2019t know which is more horrible: the autocratic tendencies of this president, or the way in which the business community as a whole refuses to stand up to him. I can\u2019t help but think of German and Italian business men in the run-up to the second world war. I don\u2019t think history will remember any of these business leaders well.\n\nThe Davos speech was the usual mixture of bluster and policy points, but the president said almost nothing of substance about China. He was tough on Europe\u2019s value added tax and cumbersome regulations, and told Canada that \u201cwe don\u2019t need your lumber or your oil\u201d, but when it came to China, he made no threats and had no real policy prescriptions. Indeed, the one point of substance he raised, regarding talks with Russia and China about reducing nuclear arsenals, has not a chance of succeeding. Neither nation has expressed any interest in reducing nukes \u2014 why would they? There was also no mention of tariffs against China and no discussion of Taiwan (Trump isn\u2019t interested in a war in the South China Sea; indeed, he made it clear he wants to end the one in Ukraine ASAP). Couple all this with the capitulation on TikTok and signs that the US is open to trade talks with Beijing. Trump is showing us that all the tough talk about China was a PR show for his base. His main focus will be on building industrial capacity and keeping US stock markets high \u2014 not starting a trade war with Beijing.\n\nBefore the Trump administration, there was much fretting about the frothy tech market, which has been highly concentrated in a handful of Silicon Valley stocks. But tech bros are now running things in Washington; the picture of Zuck, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and others sitting with Trump\u2019s family at the inauguration is already iconic. In his Davos speech, Trump said he considered the EU\u2019s antitrust cases against Apple and Google to be a \u201cform of taxation\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009these are American companies and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that\u201d. Big Tech valuations are based in large part on monopoly power, and to the extent that the threat of any federal antitrust action or regulation of AI is now gone, I think these stocks are unlikely to correct anytime soon.\n\nPeter, what are your takeaways from Trump week one?\n\nRana, that\u2019s a pretty good list, though I think Trump could turn against both China and the tech industry very quickly. The president\u2019s gentler-than-expected approach to Beijing, I think, is driven by the transactional nature of everything he does \u2014 he thinks he can get a deal done to land TikTok with an American owner, launch a Chinese crackdown on the export of fentanyl precursors to avoid tariffs and convince Xi Jinping to pressure the Kremlin to sue for peace in Ukraine.\n\nThe problem is, China has shown no inclination to do any of these things (though it may be softening on allowing the sale of TikTok), and there are plenty of hardcore China hawks within the most senior reaches of the president\u2019s national security team, including Marco Rubio, the recently sworn-in secretary of state, and Michael Waltz, national security adviser. Rubio and Waltz (as well as Peter Navarro, who has joined the White House staff after a stint in prison for contempt of Congress) will be pressing Trump to reverse his dovish tone the minute any putative deal hits a roadblock.\n\nTrump\u2019s support for the tech industry is similarly fraught with conflicting factions. Right now, he\u2019s doing the bidding of the biggest of Big Tech names, several of which have cases not only before the European Commission but also the US competition authorities at the Federal Trade Commission and the justice department. But as the recent White House rollout of the so-called Stargate AI infrastructure project has demonstrated, the politics of Big Tech are complicated \u2014 especially with Elon Musk setting up an office within the White House bureaucracy. Musk immediately criticised the Stargate deal, arguing the companies behind the initiative (including OpenAI, which is in the middle of a legal battle with Musk) didn\u2019t have the promised funding on hand. I\u2019d expect more of that infighting to come, with Trump forced to take sides.\n\nThe one business sector you didn\u2019t mention is the oil and gas industry, which had some of the clearest wins in week one. Although Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord (again) got most of the attention, that was just one of about a half-dozen executive orders aimed at the energy sector. They opened new lands for fossil fuel exploration, cleared some hurdles for permitting and eased environmental regulations on oil and gas production.\n\nOur friend and former colleague Ed Crooks, now a top energy analyst at Wood Mackenzie, is sceptical whether any of these measures will have a medium-term impact on oil and gas output \u2014 those are driven by market prices and investor sentiment more than federal government policy, he argues \u2014 but it ticks a lot of boxes from the industry\u2019s wishlist. Perhaps that\u2019s not surprising, given that Trump has tapped industry friends for the most important energy-related jobs in his cabinet: for energy secretary, it\u2019s Chris Wright, who headed one of the US\u2019s largest fracking companies, and at interior it\u2019s billionaire Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, which along with Texas is the most fracking-friendly state in the US.\n\nWeek one was obviously not great for the entire energy sector, given there was a concomitant undermining of the renewables industry \u2014 in addition to withdrawing from Paris, there were restrictions on wind power development, unwinding incentives on electric vehicles and scrapping efficiency standards on household appliances. But if I were an executive at an oil and gas company right now, I\u2019d be pretty happy with how the first week went.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c122bd9b-e933-417f-97c3-67d766610f9a"}}, {"id": "a8f18f08-8120-4261-a6ab-018feff75c05", "event_name": "DeepSeek sell-off shows the risks of a concentrated US stock market", "blurb": "Should investors turn to equally weighted index products?", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is an FT contributing editor\n\nThe current sell-off in the tech sector triggered by the progress of Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek is a reminder of the risks of a concentrated stock market. The largest 10 stocks account for almost two-fifths of the S&P 500. Such concentration is unprecedented in modern times. Increasingly, equally weighted index products, which invest the same amount of money in every stock in a benchmark, are being touted as a way to dodge the risks of an ever more concentrated portfolio. Should investors heed these calls?\n\nMore concentrated stock markets make for less diversified passive portfolios. But this need not be a problem for either returns or even risk-adjusted returns. Having a third of your portfolio in a handful of stocks that compound high double-digit returns has been fabulous for passive investors in recent years, if less so for those active managers that underweighted Big Tech.\n\nAnd there are good reasons why the largest companies are so highly valued. Today\u2019s superstar corporates capture global economies of scale. They manufacture and control valuable intellectual property and have demonstrated the ability to commercialise it. Their earnings have been fast growing and persistently so. Market prices tell us that investors believe this trend can be sustained.\n\nBut the most valuable companies of today are rarely the most valuable ones 10 years hence. Research by Bridgewater Associates last year examined the performance of the most prized US businesses going back to 1900. By assembling a new cohort at the start of each decade and tracking their relative performances, the authors found that a market-weighted basket of the largest 10 stocks underperformed the market by an average 22 per cent over the next decade. Run the clock three decades forward and this underperformance extended to 53 per cent.\n\nSuch dynamism is healthy. Superstar tech companies of yesteryear such as Eastman Kodak, Xerox and Lucent have been supplanted by today\u2019s Apple, Amazon and Alphabet. Some combination of spirited competition on the part of the market and effective antitrust machinery is key to economic growth.\n\nIt is possible that today\u2019s megacaps will be more successful than their forebears in either reinventing and disrupting themselves to stave off challengers, or in stifling competition and capturing government. But to believe so is to believe that this time will be different. And for long-term investors pondering equal-weighted index products, this is the big call. Reversion to a less concentrated market requires underperformance on the part of the largest companies. It is this that would be likely to propel outperformance by equally weighted index trackers.\n\nNo one can know whether the megacap tech titans of today will sustain, or perhaps even grow, their market presence. A year ago, the elastic band seemed stretched. Since then, the so-called Magnificent Seven have delivered an average return of more than 60 per cent in 2024. There is certainly no foolproof quantitative model that will foretell the future. And so, like much of investing, it comes down to a judgment call.\n\nGoldman Sachs published its call in October. In its judgment, today\u2019s index concentration will unwind, and the impact this has on the long-term return estimates is profound. The bank\u2019s forecast team, led by David Kostin, estimates the S&P 500 will return only 3 per cent a year over the next 10 years. With no change in index concentration, their call would have been a return of 7 per cent a year. As such, their baseline expectation is for stocks to underperform US Treasuries \u2014 a historical rarity.\n\nOne of the attractions of passive investing on a market cap-weighted basis is that it offers a free ride on markets that have been made efficient through the analytical toils of active investors. Passive investors do not need to take a view on the prospects of any individual company. To invest in an equally weighted index fund, by contrast, is to implicitly reject the notion that the stock market is efficient.\n\nEqual-weight index products are a way to take exposure to American stocks without betting that this time will be different. They offer investors diversification, but run the risk of missing out if the Magnificent Seven continue their upward march. As the late Charlie Munger once observed, \u201cdiversification is for the know-nothing investor\u201d. His point was not that diversification was stupid, but rather that it diluted any insights that professional investors might have. Theory dictates that Munger\u2019s know-nothing investor would be best served by market cap-weighted index investing. For those wishing to capitalise on a view that today\u2019s extreme concentration will revert to mean, equally weighted index products may prove more attractive.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/dc193d22-3221-4945-b0b1-430a12966d2f"}}, {"id": "c80f5366-9910-4b5c-9df1-3e4d353a9060", "event_name": "A farcical Colombian chapter in Trump\u2019s trade war", "blurb": "A pointless spat over deportation flights shows the destructive futility ahead ", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "Well, that made no sense at all. Believe what narrative you want: following an exchange of heated rhetoric and mutual threats of trade sanctions on social media yesterday, either Colombian President Gustavo Petro backed down from his refusal to allow military deportation flights or Donald Trump blinked and allowed said removals to proceed in a more humane manner. Given the relative sizes of their economies (an instant analysis by the Kiel Institute of Trump\u2019s threatened 25 per cent tariffs showed a distinctly non-negligible 0.4-0.6 per cent hit on annual Colombian GDP) it\u2019s quite likely Petro didn\u2019t think through the consequences of acting on his own. He might well have found the dollar-based financial system mightier than the pen of his anti-colonialist poetic defiance on, of all places, Elon Musk\u2019s X social media platform. On the other hand, US stock futures fell after Trump made his threats, which might merit some reflection for all those people who\u2019ve confidently been telling me that the president will never do anything to weaken share prices.\n\nIt\u2019s also entirely possible that both think they got a result. Petro got the confrontation he wanted rather than just doing the theatre of taking handcuffs off deportees without actually refusing them, as Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva did in Brazil. Trump no doubt thinks his willingness to reach for the heavy ordnance in terms of tariffs and financial sanctions worked, and will do so again. Is this the end of this particular chapter of the saga? What will happen to the threatened tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China to be imposed on Friday? By now you know my habitual quotation from screenwriter William Goldman (of whom I\u2019m genuinely thinking of carrying around a cardboard cut-out): nobody knows anything.\n\nDespite said mantra I did ask you all to guess what Trump would do first on taking office, and I report back on that below. Today\u2019s main piece is on how tax and trade wars combine to create a whole new conflict. Responding to reader demand, I also look at Trump\u2019s plan for an External Revenue Service. Charted Waters is on Bitcoin. Any thoughts on anything: alan.beattie@ft.com.\n\nIt seems like we weren\u2019t looking at a wide enough field of fire when trying to anticipate the opening salvos. The surprise on the first day of Trump\u2019s presidency was the threat to impose punitive taxes on foreign corporations and nationals in the US in retaliation for what he describes as unfair taxes abroad, as well as the somewhat more predictable decision to pull out the OECD agreement on minimum corporate tax.\n\nThe mechanism Trump chose, a little-known 90-year-old provision of the tax code, was unexpected. But the US moaning about foreigners imposing unfair taxes on US companies abroad has a strong recent history. In the past it has spilled into trade disputes and may now do so again, depending on if and how Trump conducts his assault.\n\nGiven the number of tech bros swarming over his administration, it\u2019s not surprising Trump is repeating his first-term offensive on the digital services taxes (DSTs) that several European countries have introduced. But since before his first election in 2016 he\u2019s also been moaning about countries with a value added tax. Export rebates on VAT, so the argument goes, act like tariffs by charging US exporters entering a foreign market while foreign companies aren\u2019t charged in the US, which doesn\u2019t have VAT.\n\nFew economists buy this argument, but Trump\u2019s VAT obsession taps into a rich and venerable vein of grievance on the subject among certain Washington trade lawyers.\n\nThe US introduced a tax provision, the Foreign Sales Corporation, in the 1980s to correct for the alleged VAT disadvantage. The EU brought WTO cases against it and an associated measure starting in 1997. After nearly a decade of prolonged litigation and complaints about compliance, Brussels won.\n\nThere was lots of grumpiness on Capitol Hill about the US\u2019s sovereign right to tax, similar to the interminable \u201czeroing\u201d dispute over WTO rulings against US antidumping methodology. And thus was added another eye of newt to the simmering Washington cauldron of resentment about WTO dispute settlement that caused the US progressively to detach from it.\n\nOK, so. What\u2019s Trump going to do about it and what can the EU (the main likely target, certainly for digital taxes) do to defend or counterattack? If Trump uses trade or investment restrictions to punish the EU for its DSTs, the EU\u2019s choice is clear and things could get spicy very quickly. As keen readers will know, the EU created an \u201canti-coercion instrument\u201d (ACI) precisely because of Trump\u2019s previous threats on DSTs. The ACI gives the EU wide leeway to retaliate against foreign governments that use trade tools to attempt to force the EU or its governments to change policy \u2014 in this case to kill the DSTs.\n\nThe ACI has now been on the books since 2023 and hasn\u2019t been used. What better casus belli than the original provocation come back again? The only thing is making sure enough member states are on board, since they gave themselves a big say over deploying the ACI, and Trump will no doubt try to bully or bribe them out of it.\n\nOn the other hand, if Trump sticks to using purely tax tools to punish the EU for DSTs, they might find it harder to respond. Power over tax still mainly resides with EU member states, not centrally. The ACI is supposed to be used against trade and investment actions only. If Trump manages to discipline himself to meeting DSTs (and maybe VATs) with tax retribution, he might put the EU in a difficult spot, unable to retaliate collectively. Then again, precision and self-discipline, as Gustavo Petro could now tell you, aren\u2019t exactly the traits for which Trump is famous.\n\nAnother weird out-of-the blue plan of Trump\u2019s is to start collecting tariff revenue through a new External Revenue Service, part of his insistence that foreign exporters pay the taxes on imports to the US. At least one reader has asked me if this means anything, so as a service I had a think. More usefully, I also went to one of the world\u2019s great repositories of customs-related knowledge, Anna Jerzewska, founder of the consultancy Trade and Borders.\n\nThe verdict: \u201cno\u201d. I\u2019m sure many of you know this already, but companies sending goods across borders generally hire a registered customs broker to do all the formalities including paying duties. For smaller consignments this might be a carrier like FedEx, for larger ones more likely a specialist company or a service offered by the big cargo carriers such as Maersk. The importing company involved typically pays the broker who transfers the money to the customs authorities, in the US\u2019s case Customs and Border Protection.\n\nUnless Trump is going to try some impossible scheme such as charging a foreign exporter tax in its home country before the goods are shipped, the system can\u2019t really be changed. Jerzewska says: \u201cIt\u2019s very unclear what any External Revenue Service will do, but what it won\u2019t do is collect tariffs in a radically different way. Tariffs are charged to importers, and that will continue.\u201d And that, as far as I am concerned, is that.\n\nHopefully someone can make Trump happy with a plan to do something for show. He could carve out some part of CBP and called it the External Revenue Service if he wants, perhaps fitting its officers out in snazzy outfits featuring a silver belt buckle in the shape of a dollar sign. After all, the Italian Guardia di Finanza, a militarised tax police force who collect customs duties among their other tasks, wear intimidating grey uniforms complete with ceremonial swords and zip around in impressively heavy-duty patrol boats. Collecting taxes in Italy isn\u2019t traditionally a task for the faint-hearted. Someone get Trump a brochure.\n\nNone of this posturing will make any difference, of course, to the question of who actually bears the cost of import taxes. A rise in tariffs could be absorbed by the foreign exporter who reduces their prices to keep the post-tax import price the same, or by a company inside the US economy taking the hit from the higher price of imported inputs on its margins. Or it could be passed along to the eventual end-user. The evidence from the first Trump administration is that it was some combination of the second and third. Relabelling existing collection mechanisms won\u2019t change this.\n\nI asked you a few weeks back what Trump\u2019s first trade action would be as president. \u201cRepeal the offshore drilling ban, even if he has to break the law\u201d was spot on \u2014 Trump issued an executive order to that effect on the first day \u2014 assuming we count that as a trade action. \u201cDeclare a national economic emergency\u201d was the most innovative suggestion. Not quite yet, but I guess if he follows through with tariffs on someone like Colombia using the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA), that will be fulfilled. Obviously putting tariffs on Mexico and Canada was another popular guess. But in the latter case we\u2019re going to have to wait until the February 1 deadline to see if that happens.\n\nHaving a cryptocurrency fan in the White House is, it seems, good for Bitcoin\u2019s business.\n\nThe FT does a big overview on Trump\u2019s waging of global economic warfare.\n\nThe EU is contemplating introducing \u201cBuy Europe\u201d domestic procurement rules. This would be a victory for France, which has pushed the idea for decades.\n\nMy FT colleague Martin Sandbu says the EU should grasp the trading and economic opportunities that Trump\u2019s policies are opening up.\n\nSam Lowe of the Most-Favoured Nation newsletter heroically does his best to explain that the regional \u201cPEM\u201d convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin, which the UK may or may not take up the EU\u2019s offer to join, isn\u2019t a customs union. Also, for those keeping up with the twists and turns of UK policy, the government is apparently now not in favour of a full trade deal with the US after all.\n\nIf your idea of fun is a trivia competition with other economics and finance nerds \u2014 and let\u2019s face it, if it isn\u2019t I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re doing here \u2014 then the FT\u2019s Alphaville is holding the inaugural Washington leg of its legendary pub quiz on February 6.

A European executive, sharing the World Economic Forum shuttle bus with me, buried her head in her hands and lamented: \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d\n\nBut the response of delegates from the Middle East, Asia and Africa was very different. Many people from the global south (to use the annoying shorthand) think Trump is good news for them. Recent polling shows that, in countries such as India, Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil, this pro-Trump attitude extends well beyond the Davos-going elites.\n\nThe US president is widely seen, outside the west, as transactional, pro-business and a peacemaker. What\u2019s not to like?\n\nPlenty, actually. Look beyond the hype and there are many reasons for the global south to be deeply concerned about Trump\u2019s America.\n\nThe US president is essentially pushing for an abandonment of the \u201crules-based international order\u201d that has provided the stability and open markets that allowed China, India and a large part of south-east Asia to become much richer over the last 30 years.\n\nRipping up those rules and moving to a completely transactional world may sound refreshingly straightforward. But a world without rules is one in which the strong prey upon the weak \u2014 without any framework of law or principle to constrain them. And most of the countries of the global south are more likely to end up as prey than predator.\n\nPanama, Colombia and Mexico are among the first nations to discover how uncomfortable a Trumpian world can be. Some 80 per cent of Mexico\u2019s exports go to the US. If Trump goes ahead with his threatened tariffs, he could push America\u2019s southern neighbour into an economic depression.\n\nMexico, of course, is not alone. Trump has threatened most major trading nations in the world with tariffs. The notion that this does not really matter because the president is \u201ctransactional\u201d \u2014 and that all his threats are simply preludes to a deal \u2014 ignores the way that business operates. International companies need stability and predictable legal regimes if they are to have the confidence to make long-term cross-border investments.\n\nThe evidence is that even when Trump makes a deal, there is no guarantee he will stick to it. During his first term, the US negotiated a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico \u2014 known as the USMCA. But Trump is now demanding fresh concessions.\n\nIf all agreements can be ripped up, in response to some new grievance or to take advantage of a shift in the balance of power, then no trade deal is secure. As one former central banker put it to me in Davos: \u201cThe logic of that is that you end up only being safe trading inside your own borders.\u201d\n\nWesterners may be shocked to see a US president talk like a mafia boss who wants more protection money. But many in the global south have always believed that American leaders act like mobsters \u2014 even if they talk like missionaries. At least, they say, Trump has now dropped the infuriating moralising. The hope is that a less hypocritical US will be easier to deal with, because it will not make unrealistic demands based on irrelevant western values.\n\nBut we are beginning to see what a US that proudly proclaims it has no altruistic interest in the outside world looks like \u2014 and it is not pretty. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, has announced a suspension of almost all US aid programmes. Only those that directly benefit Americans will be renewed. That could end programmes such as Pepfar, which provides drugs to combat HIV and Aids and has saved millions of lives around the world.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has casually appeared to endorse ethnic cleansing in Gaza. That could be terrible news for the Palestinians who would lose their homeland \u2014 and will also deeply alarm Jordan and Egypt, which are meant to take in the new refugees.\n\nThe US will certainly not be volunteering to resettle anybody. The poem carved on the Statue of Liberty proclaims: \u201cGive me your tired, your poor\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\u201d But, to put it mildly, that is not the mood of Trump\u2019s America, where the president\u2019s supporters wave banners demanding \u201cmass deportation now\u201d. Programmes to resettle refugees in the US have already been suspended.\n\nCutting down on legal immigration from places that Trump once described as \u201cshithole countries\u201d might also sound like good policy to many Americans. But it does not sound like good news for the middle classes of the global south, who may find that prized visas for skilled immigrants or students are much harder to come by.\n\nStill, perhaps all the concerns about trade, aid and migration can be waved away if Trump makes good on his promise to end wars around the world. However, the president\u2019s aspiration to be a global peacemaker is difficult to reconcile with his proclaimed ambition to expand US territory.\n\nIf there is one idea that the countries of the global south all claim to repudiate, it is imperialism. If Trump turns out to be both serious and literal about his plans to expand America\u2019s borders, their applause for him may quickly fade away.\n\ngideon.rachman@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/51e4c1a6-ef17-4e14-bea3-645e611008a3"}}, {"id": "4d12080c-fed9-4522-a233-37257cb091cf", "event_name": "Donald Trump sparks race for trade deals to counter US tariffs", "blurb": "Nations turn to tactic used in US president\u2019s first term when more bilateral agreements were signed  ", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "The US\u2019s economic partners are racing to sustain trade volumes in a Donald Trump era by closing new bilateral deals and rerouting supply chains to cope with increased US protectionism.\n\nPolicymakers and trade experts say countries are turning to a tactic deployed during the US president\u2019s first term in office, when they signed more trade deals with one another as the world\u2019s biggest consumer economy erected barriers.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s election in November, the EU has clinched a long-awaited trade deal with the Mercosur bloc of South American countries, updated a free trade agreement with Mexico, and reopened negotiations with Malaysia that were moribund for more than a decade.\n\nTrump meanwhile in his first days in office threatened tariffs of up to 100 per cent on China, 25 per cent on Canada and Mexico, and said he was considering a blanket levy on all US imports.

We don\u2019t believe in trade wars. We have an unpredictable president who throws tariffs around all over the place. Let\u2019s see what we can do together.\u201d\n\nMalmstr\u00f6m, now with the law firm Covington & Burling, expects a deal with Mexico and talks with Australia, Indonesia and possibly the Philippines and Thailand to be concluded during Trump\u2019s four-year term.\n\nBernd Lange, who chairs the European parliament\u2019s trade committee, said the EU\u2019s response to Trump would couple retaliatory tariffs with deeper trade relationships elsewhere. \u201cApart from defending ourselves, we should further strengthen our partnership with third countries like the UK, Mexico, Japan or Canada, who might also be in the crossfire.\n\n\u201cThis means ratifying trade agreements like EU-Mercosur, and concluding negotiations with partners like Australia and Indonesia.\u201d\n\nIn 2020 Asean countries plus China, Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand formed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. RCEP mainly reduced non-tariff barriers to trade such as veterinary controls and customs procedures. RCEP covers 2.3bn people and 30 per cent of global GDP, compared with 25 per cent by the US.\n\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area, which will scrap 90 per cent of tariffs over time, started in 2021.\n\nGoods and services trade has continued to grow in recent years despite the Covid-19 pandemic and rising protectionism.\n\nScott Lincicome at the Cato Institute, a Washington-based think-tank, said: \u201cRegardless of what Donald Trump does over the next few years, everyone else appears unwilling to embrace costly economic isolationism and will instead just move on without us. There are about 370 trade deals in force as of mid-2024 with no sign of a forthcoming reversal.\u201d\n\nChina, meanwhile, has recently clinched deals with Serbia, Cambodia, Nicaragua and Ecuador. Beijing, which Trump sees as the US\u2019s greatest rival, accounts for about 30 per cent of global manufacturing.\n\nOne senior trade official, who declined to be named, said they were \u201cmore sceptical this time round\u201d of a flurry of dealmaking because the agreements left to complete were tougher to negotiate.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s return might promote new bilaterals, perhaps in Africa.

Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and aiden.reiter@ft.com.\n\nIn his first week in office, Donald Trump ordered the government to suspend the asylum process, halted refugee admissions, put pressure on states to comply with future deportation efforts, and moved to end birthright citizenship. It may be that the goal of these early actions is simply to discourage further immigration, and encourage illegal immigrants to \u201cdeport themselves.\u201d But it may be that Trump is serious about significantly reducing the US workforce.\n\nRecord numbers of migrants came into the US after the pandemic, growing US consumption and the American labour force. This, many argue, was the key reason the US continued to grow, even as inflation fell quickly. Graph from Torsten Slok at Apollo:\n\nBy the end of 2024, illegal migration had already slowed from its earlier peaks; according to US Customs and Border Protection, the number of encounters at the Southern border \u2014 a proxy for illegal migration \u2014 steadily fell from 301,000 in December 2023 to 102,000 by September 2024. Legal migration in 2024 was about 820,000, according to the Congressional Budget Office, around the 25-year average.\n\nTrump has pledged to limit both legal and illegal immigration. But does he have both the will and the means to follow through on his most aggressive goal \u2014 completely stopping illegal immigration, and deporting the illegal immigrants who are already here?\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, in 2022 there were around 11mn illegal aliens in the US, or 5 per cent of the US workforce. Pushing out even a significant fraction of that population would have big implications for the agriculture, hospitality, and construction industries (just the threat of deportations has led to reports of farmworker shortages). The inflationary implications, at least in the short term, are easy to imagine. Deprived of cheap labour, those industries and others will either have to raise wages to attract more workers, and raise prices to protect profits, or cut down on production, restricting supply.\n\nThere is a lot of uncertainty here. We don\u2019t know how far Trump will go, and it is likely that some states and municipalities will push back. Wendy Edelberg at the Brookings Institution modelled out two scenarios: one where Trump is able to reshape the immigration system entirely, and one where he only has limited success. In the first scenario, the US sees outmigration, or a net loss of civilians, starting in 2025; in the second, immigration slows, but the population still grows (the model assumes some normalisation after the Trump term):\n\nEdelberg and her colleagues estimate that both scenarios slow real economic growth in 2025: by .4 per cent in the severe scenario, and .1 per cent in the restrained. They also say that inflation could go up by as much as 1.5 per cent over three years, but will be partially offset by a reduction in demand. In the longer term, when the population growth impacts will be felt, the shifts will be more severe: the level of real GDP in 2034 will be lower by 2.1 per cent in scenario 1, and 1.5 in scenario 2, as compared to the current outlook.\n\nBut the point is all the same: the US economy is built around access to cheap migrant labour. Retooling it for low immigration will be disruptive.\n\n(Reiter and Armstrong)\n\nStockpickers \u2014 to the degree there are any stockpickers left in a world of index, factor, and quant investors \u2014 face a dilemma this year. The US economy looks strong, especially relative to the rest of the world; US stocks have momentum; and business sentiment is effervescent. A good time to add risk, then. At the same time, however, there is a massive change in economic policy underfoot, with unknown implications. In particular, it is pretty clear that something tariff-y this way comes. This will come on top of asset prices that are expensive and Fed monetary policy that seems \u2014 presidential protests aside \u2014 likely to stay tight. All this counsels a degree of defensive posturing.\n\nThose of you who \u2014 like Unhedged \u2014 will enter the FT stockpicking contest operate under even more constraints. Once you choose your five long or short positions (by midnight on the 31st of this month) you are locked in for 11 months. No changing your mind after a policy surprise. And dividends don\u2019t count, which eliminates a bunch of stocks that return their profits that way.\n\nUnhedged works under another constraint. As a US-focused column, we select from the S&P 500.

The federal government currently lacks the systems, the facilities and, in some cases, the legal authority to carry out the operations that Trump has described.\n\nAccording to the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration non-profit group, it would take more than 10 years and cost almost $1tn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you just flip a switch and just immediately start rounding people up and sending them to the border,\u201d says John Torres, a former Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director during the George W Bush and Barack Obama administrations. ICE and its sister agency, Customs and Border Protection, are tasked with removing unauthorised migrants from the US \u2014 ICE from the country\u2019s interior, and CBP at the border.\n\nThe deportation infrastructure is already stretched perilously thin. In the fiscal year 2024, under Joe Biden\u2019s administration, ICE, which takes care of removals with court orders, deported 271,484 unauthorised immigrants, a 10-year high. The peak under Trump\u2019s first term was 267,000 in fiscal year 2019.\n\n\u201cThe idea of 1mn to 2mn [deportations] a year is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009aspirational. It\u2019s probably unrealistic, given the resources that are available to do it,\u201d says Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a predecessor agency to ICE, who is now at the Migration Policy Institute think-tank. \u201cThe numbers are not likely to be dramatically greater [than they are now], at least for a while.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has demonstrated a willingness to take drastic steps to realise some version of its goal, for example threatening to use an arcane wartime law that allows the federal government to detain and deport citizens of enemy nations, and opening the way for private prison companies to add capacity for tens of thousands of detainees at speed.\n\nDespite these extreme measures, however, some experts and former immigration officials told the Financial Times that Trump\u2019s ambition simply could not be accomplished.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s going to be impossible for them to achieve the goal that they set out \u2014 which is really getting rid of all the illegal immigrants in the United States,\u201d says David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute think-tank.\n\nThe first obstacle for the Trump team is to detain many of the people they say they want to deport.\n\nTrump and his immigration tsar, Tom Homan, say they are prioritising the deportation of undocumented migrants with criminal histories. Going after people who have been convicted of crimes is likely to be a more politically palatable way of ramping up deportations.\n\nICE says that, as of July last year, there were 662,566 non-citizens with criminal convictions or pending charges, approximately 15,000 of whom have already been detained by the agency. About 148,000 have been convicted or charged with assault, murder, kidnapping or sexual assault.\n\nBut one problem is that the definition of \u201ccriminal\u201d on this list is a broad one \u2014 more than 128,000 people are on it for traffic offences.\n\n\u201cWhat ICE is very good at is working off lists,\u201d says John Sandweg, acting director of ICE during the Obama administration. Agents know who they are looking for and might have location information, he says.\n\nYet Sandweg says that it takes time to find and apprehend someone who is at large after committing serious crimes, something that consumes \u201ctraditional police work\u201d like \u201cbuilding informant relationships in the immigrant communities\u201d. As a result, it can often be easier for immigration officials to deport people accused of petty crimes.\n\nThe focus on expelling undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions or charges is not new. But the Trump administration says that it is bolstering the federal response to harness the defence, state and justice departments. The Pentagon said on Wednesday that it would deploy about 1,500 active-duty troops, plus helicopters, to the US-Mexico border, a 60 per cent increase in ground forces there.\n\nHoman has also said there will be more so-called collateral arrests, in which immigrants who are not targeted for arrest are swept up during enforcement actions.\n\nLucas Guttentag, a professor at Stanford Law School, says that \u201chuge numbers of people who don\u2019t fit that profile [of criminals] are going to get swept in\u201d to any mass deportation drive. He adds: \u201cThat\u2019s going to be camouflaged, because they\u2019re trying to manipulate public reaction by saying they\u2019re only doing particular targets. The reality is going to be very different.\u201d\n\nAny push to expand arrests will also require co-operation from local law enforcement agencies.\n\nUnder the constitution, the federal government does not have authority over state enforcement bodies. Instead, it has set up so-called 287(g) agreements \u2014 voluntary programmes that allow ICE to delegate immigration enforcement to state and local agencies.\n\nIn one of the executive orders signed last Monday, Trump directed the government to pursue such agreements \u201cto the maximum extent permitted by law\u201d.\n\nThe administration seems to be building towards a political fight with so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions, which refuse to co-operate with federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump sought to deny federal funding to localities adopting \u201csanctuary\u201d policies, efforts that were blocked by US courts. The president has resurfaced this strategy, asking the attorney-general and the secretary of homeland security to \u201censure\u201d that such jurisdictions, \u201cwhich seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to federal funds\u201d.\n\nThe Department of Justice has directed staff to investigate state and local officials who fail to comply with \u201cimmigration-related commands\u201d for potential prosecutions, in what many observers view as a thinly veiled threat.\n\nOn Capitol Hill last week, both houses of Congress passed the Laken Riley Act with bipartisan votes. Named after a nursing student who was killed last year by an unauthorised immigrant, the bill broadens the number of offences that require mandatory detention of undocumented immigrants until they are deported to include theft, burglary, larceny or shoplifting. Trump is expected to sign the bill into law swiftly, which would make it the first legislative win of his second presidency.\n\nTrump has also focused on broadening the power of arrest. He has rescinded guidance set by former president Joe Biden that barred ICE agents from making arrests at or near \u201csensitive locations\u201d such as places of worship and schools \u2014 a move that legal experts warn might dent students\u2019 attendance for fear of immigration enforcement actions.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has already been successful in instilling fear in immigrant communities and making it more difficult\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009to do simple things like take their children to school, access medical care, pray in houses of worship,\u201d says Elora Mukherjee, professor at Columbia Law School.\n\nThis raises the question about the political reaction to a large increase in arrests. During Trump\u2019s first term, he faced a public relations catastrophe over the separation of migrant children from their parents. The risk for the White House is that distressing images of mass arrests make the rounds in the news and on social media, including people who are pillars of their communities, prompting a bipartisan backlash.\n\nSandweg says that when in the ICE director chair, \u201cyou get calls from Republican members of Congress [asking], \u2018Why are you deporting this guy?\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I\u2019m getting these calls from the pastor and from the congregants.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven if the administration is successful in detaining many more undocumented migrants, it would face the problem of having to house them. Tens of thousands of people will need to be held for months while they await trial in immigration courts.\n\nICE has capacity \u2014 measured in number of beds \u2014 to detain 41,500 people at any given time. Homan has indicated he will need \u201cat least 100,000 beds\u201d to carry out the administration\u2019s aims.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinarily important piece of this puzzle, and dealing with capacity issues in detention will be a challenge,\u201d says Bier at the Cato Institute.\n\nThe American Immigration Council reckons that, if the administration is to deport all the 11mn undocumented people living in the country, ICE will need to build 216 new facilities every year for more than a decade, each with a capacity of 500 people.\n\nHousing detainees will fall largely to private prisons, which accounted for as much as 90 per cent of detentions in 2023, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe market values of the country\u2019s two biggest private prison companies have surged since the election: GEO Group\u2019s stock has doubled, while CoreCivic\u2019s has risen more than 50 per cent.\n\nThe for-profit prison industry was a strong backer of Trump\u2019s campaign, after he vowed to scrap a 2021 Biden order that began phasing out DoJ contracts with for-profit prisons \u2014 which he also did on his first day in office.\n\nCoreCivic, which supplies about 10,000 beds, says it could almost quadruple this capacity in about 180 days.\n\n\u201cWe could go tomorrow and incrementally staff up,\u201d says chief executive Damon Hininger. \u201cWe\u2019re having those conversations with ICE on how we could be helpful if they do raise the level of capacity.\u201d\n\nBut expanding capacity comes at a high cost. The AIC estimates the government, if it were to deport all undocumented people, would need to spend $66bn a year just on building and operating detention facilities.\n\nNew holding facilities would cost about $36mn a piece to build and another $48mn a year to staff and operate. \u201cThe long-term costs of a mass deportation operation, while difficult to gauge, would undeniably be enormous,\u201d the AIC concluded in a recent report.\n\nRepublicans have promised to allocate up to $100bn for border security and enforcement for an unspecified timeframe. But even if they can get that through Congress, in the near term the authorities will struggle to muster the necessary resources \u2014 even if other law enforcement agencies are roped in.\n\n\u201cThere is no way\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they have the staff, the money and the resources and the legal authority to turn and start doing immigration enforcement [and] immigration detention,\u201d says Jason Houser, a former ICE chief of staff.\n\nThe final logistical challenge for the administration is deporting the people who have been detained.\n\nIndividuals with outstanding deportation orders may be removed immediately. \u201cBut that is a relatively small number,\u201d says Stephen Yale-Loehr, retired immigration law professor at Cornell Law School. \u201cMost people picked up will be put into deportation proceedings in immigration courts.\u201d\n\nThat places the rest of the burden on underfunded and overburdened immigration courts, which could be a significant stumbling block to Trump\u2019s plans. The courts\u2019 backlog has swelled from 656,000 pending cases in the fiscal year 2017 to 3.6mn at the end of fiscal year 2024, according to MPI.\n\nTrump is seeking to sidestep immigration courts altogether. The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday issued a new rule that expanded the reach of \u201cexpedited removal\u201d, under which undocumented immigrants who cannot prove they have been in the country for more than two years are deported with no court review. Trump pursued a similar measure during his first presidency.\n\nThe practice previously applied to individuals apprehended within around 115 miles of the country\u2019s international land borders. Now, it may be used across the US.\n\n\u201cThe effect of this change will be to enhance national security and public safety \u2014 while reducing government costs \u2014 by facilitating prompt immigration determinations,\u201d said the DHS.\n\nThe Trump administration could also face opposition\u00a0from some of the countries to which it wants to deport migrants. Colombia announced on Sunday that it had declined entry to US military flights carrying migrants, saying the individuals needed to be flown on civilian planes and treated with \u201cdignity and respect\u201d.\n\nTrump immediately responded by placing 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Colombia, which were later paused after Bogot\u00e1 agreed to grant entry to the military flights.\n\nTrump\u2019s flurry of immigration policies is set to face a wave of legal challenges, with some Democratic states and civil rights groups already suing his administration.\n\nThe ACLU and other groups on Wednesday sued to block the DHS rule broadening \u201cexpedited removal\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration wants to use this illegal policy to fuel its mass deportation agenda and rip communities apart,\u201d Anand Balakrishnan, an ACLU lawyer leading the case, said in a statement. \u201cExpanding expedited removal would give Trump a cheat code to circumvent due process and the constitution.\u201d The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDemocratic state attorneys-general and civil rights groups have also filed several lawsuits to invalidate Trump\u2019s new executive order that bans birthright citizenship, alleging that it violates the constitution\u2019s 14th amendment, which says that all \u201cpersons born or naturalized in the United States\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009are citizens of the United States\u201d. This ban has already been temporarily halted by a US federal judge. The White House said it would appeal.\n\nHoman on Sunday said that his idea of success does not necessarily include deporting every unauthorised immigrant in the US, in what seemed like an attempt at managing expectations. \u201cI\u2019m being realistic,\u201d he told ABC. \u201cWe can do what we can with the money we have\u201d.\n\nBut Homan has also insisted the administration will accelerate arrests and detentions, even if there is political opposition. And he is willing to put heavy pressure on local politicians who try to stymie those efforts.\n\n\u201cSanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don\u2019t want \u2014 more agents in the communities, more people arrested, more collaterals arrested,\u201d he told Fox News on Wednesday. \u201cSo that\u2019s a game they want to play? Game on.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Alex Rogers in Washington\n\nCartography by Cleve Jones\n\n\u200bLetter in response to this article:\n\nIn Trump era, politics is a game two can play\u00a0/\u00a0From Donald Conkey, Chicago, IL, US", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/59232a13-f7e2-40cd-af73-4035037cb3b3"}}, {"id": "57d9e61f-6de1-4b76-a8a6-8e6db2a51a72", "event_name": "Why the billable hour is still king in the legal world", "blurb": "High bonus payments to lawyers hitting targets show the model\u2019s staying power in face of AI  ", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "As Christmas approached, lawyers at US firms across the City of London and Wall Street rushed to hit tough end-of-year targets for the number of hours billed to clients in 2024.\n\nOne mid-level litigation associate at a US law firm in London said he had billed more than 2,000 hours, spending at least 10 hours in the office every day and working some weekends, as he helped a client prepare for a big trial. This year looks set to be just as busy.\n\nMany have predicted the demise of the billable hour as the legal profession\u2019s main charging method. But the recent bumper payday for junior lawyers \u2014 many top US firms have handed out six-figure bonuses to associates for hitting 2,000-plus billable hour targets \u2014 is the latest sign of the staying power of the industry\u2019s hallmark currency.\n\nFor years the metric, through which lawyers keep a precise log of the work they do and bill accordingly, has been a source of debate and tension between law firms and their clients. Companies have pushed back at perceived overcharging, with some arguing for the greater certainty of a fixed-fee model. Lawyers and clients have raised concerns over the well being of the armies of junior associates competing to hit high billing targets. Now, the advancement of generative artificial intelligence is fuelling fresh criticism that billing by the hour is an outdated model that encourages inefficiency.\n\n\u201cWhile some might have expected, and some predicted [the billable hour\u2019s] use as an external measure would have fallen faster, it remains the main billing method used by law firms,\u201d says Jeremy Black, a partner at Deloitte.\n\nIn the UK, the top 10 law firms are charging clients almost 40 per cent more per hour than they were five years ago and notched up more billable hours last year than the 12 months before, according to PwC.\n\nHourly rates for partners at top UK-headquartered firms have reached \u00a31,500, with US firms\u2019 rates as high as $2,000.\u00a0Rates in the top American firms last year were up more than 8 per cent, according to the Thomson Reuters Institute.\n\nSuch growth means there is little incentive for law firms to move away from the metric towards more flat-fee or subscription-type models that industries from media to consumer goods have adopted.\n\nThe billable hour took off as a linchpin for the legal industry in the 1980s, according to academic and legal publications on its history. With the rise of trade magazines such as The American Lawyer and a greater emphasis on the business of law, such metrics, along with partner profits, became important benchmarks by which firms could measure their success.\n\nThe metric survives in part because of its \u201cgreat symbolic value\u201d, says Laura Empson, a professor at Bayes Business School. \u201cIt\u2019s sending a signal to the client that professionals are dedicated to serving them.\u201d\n\nBut the new threats \u2014 chiefly AI \u2014 are set to increasingly call into question the viability of the model. In recent years, experts have anticipated a profound impact from generative AI on law firms, particularly on junior jobs. As more mundane legal tasks become automated, there would be fewer working hours for lawyers to bill.\n\nSo far, efficiencies gained by AI assisting routine tasks, such as research and drafting documents, appear to have made little headway in displacing the billable metric.\u00a0But lawyers surveyed by Thomson Reuters last year predicted AI would result in a reduction in the use of the billable hour over the next five years, saving each 12 hours of work a week.\n\nA study by Deloitte last year found that \u201conly 6 per cent of respondents report direct benefits, such as cost savings, from law firm use of the technology\u201d \u2014 but 73 per cent anticipated AI would reduce costs in law firms in the future.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more experimentation of fixed-price models, and the increasing adoption of technology will lead to change of the billing model; we\u2019re simply not there yet,\u201d says Raghu Ramanathan, president of Legal Professionals at Thomson Reuters.\n\nFiona Muir, product manager at OneAdvanced, a software provider to law firms, anticipates technology will enhance the billable hour, increasing the speed and detail of billing, for example by automatically documenting a phone call. \u201cThe narrative that you create around the task [is] easier to do. The billing is less contentious if there\u2019s more detail.\u201d\n\nThe legal sector\u2019s commitment to billable hours appears stronger than for other professional services firms. \u201cGo back 20-30 years, [consultants] were like lawyers,\u201d says Fiona Czerniawska, chief executive of Source Global Research, a consulting sector analyst, which moved away from charging by the hour after client pressure.\n\n\u201cA lot of the buyers of [legal services are] in-house lawyers,\u201d says Ben Kent, founder of Meridian West, a consultancy. \u201cThey make a noise about it but put up with it. Part of the same club.\u201d\n\nOne reason for its endurance is the inexact science of legal advice. While parts of a deal may be predictable and amenable to a fixed fee, areas such as big-ticket litigation can be harder to forecast and lawyers do not want to find themselves spending extra hours on a matter they are not getting paid for. Lawyers say clients largely accept its value even if they would like more flexibility and scrutiny of what is being billed.\n\nAmong the informal guidance given to young lawyers on billing clients is to keep the timer running if you pop to the kitchen to make a cup of tea but not if you stop to chat with a colleague. Mulling a client issue in the bath or on the train may also be billable, as long as you can properly justify it.\u00a0Software enables lawyers to track their time, usually in six- or 15-minute increments.\n\nTerra Potter, general counsel at aerospace company Hexcel Corporation until last year, describes the model as a \u201ccomplex beast \u2014 it\u2019s hard to abandon entirely\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It shows the return on investment, helps monitor work and budgets\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Some matters suit the billable hour, particularly smaller ones or those with high uncertainty. Others \u2014 litigation tranches, transactions, or document packages \u2014 lend themselves better to flat fees.\u201d\n\nBeyond its use for charging clients, the billable hour has become a key internal metric for law firms to measure and reward performance.\n\nDespite greater discussion of staff wellbeing, junior lawyers are expected to put in long hours to justify their increasingly high salaries. In the UK\u2019s top firms, newly qualified lawyers\u2019 base pay rose to \u00a3150,000 last year. At many US firms, it is even higher, reaching almost \u00a3180,000.\n\nHitting 2,000 hours a year equates to eight billable hours a day across the working week \u2014 but this does not include the many non-billable hours worked or holidays.\u00a0Some US firms pay associates extra bonuses for racking up billable hours beyond the 2,000 target. Many top UK firms deny having targets but will often only pay bonuses if certain hours are met, usually closer to 1,700 a year.\n\nBut as a measure of performance, the metric is flawed. Fulfilling targets is, in many ways, outside of a junior lawyer\u2019s control. Associates compete for work from partners to fill their quota and for every quiet week or month there is an awareness they will have to work twice as hard when business picks up. This can lead to \u201chuge peaks and troughs\u201d in working hours, according to one litigation associate at a UK firm.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s not enough work coming in or teams are over-resourced then it creates a degree of anxiety because if you have a quiet month then you know you\u2019re going to need to have some crazy months to make up for it,\u201d the associate says.\n\nThis feast or famine approach has led to some lawyers leaving private practice. One former associate at a UK firm says they moved to an in-house role in part because of the billable hour and its use as \u201can outdated method of measuring value to a law firm\u201d. The impact the high targets could have on family life was another factor.\n\nIt incentivises inefficiency, says Richard Martin, a former employment partner and now principal consultant of Byrne Dean, a wellbeing consultancy. \u201cWhen people are tired and stressed, they work less effectively and take longer. It\u2019s a vicious circle.\u201d It also encourages \u201choarding work\u201d.\n\nRewards are given to those with the physical stamina to endure such working habits, according to Empson at Bayes.\n\n\u201cPeople who are capable of billing enormous amounts of hours become heroes in firms,\u201d she says. \u201cFor all that is said about the intellect of professionals, big rewards go to people with phenomenal reserves of stamina and good health.\u201d\n\nEven if firms shift to a different fee model for clients, the billable hour will probably survive internally, according to Deloitte\u2019s Black, as it is the simplest way of measuring output. \u201cIt is likely that it will be combined with other data to provide information on the value created related to the time spent,\u201d Black suggests. \u201cOver time it does seem the internal use may be of more relative importance.\u201d", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7750aff2-0677-4ba9-b571-4e02cf83950d"}}, {"id": "e8baa9de-1428-4a18-be37-d2c9a8447e0c", "event_name": "Emerging markets braced for Trump tariffs threat", "blurb": "US president\u2019s policies are likely to push up dollar-denominated debt, hurting economies such as Mexico and Malaysia", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "The outcome of the US election was supposed to be drawn out, hard to call, and heavily contested.\n\nIn the end, it was none of the above. Donald Trump\u2019s victory at the beginning of November turned out to be emphatic, quickly decided, and accepted with little or no fuss. But that does not mean there were no immediate consequences.\n\nWithin moments of Trump beating Democrat vice-president Kamala Harris to retake the White House, the dollar had soared to a four-month high. Although the US currency recently dropped as the new president called for lower interest rates and a softer stance on China tariffs, its strength could wreak havoc for emerging market bonds.\n\nThe consensus is that Trump\u2019s policies around curbing illegal immigration, enforcing trade tariffs and lowering taxes will trigger price rises \u2014 and ultimately hinder the US central bank\u2019s ability to lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cDollar-denominated debt will rise as a result, which will seriously impact many emerging markets,\u201d says David Gibson-Moore, president of consultancy Gulf Analytica.\n\nJean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging market debt at investment company TT International, agrees. \u201cTrump\u2019s decisive victory has led to much doom-mongering among economists and emerging market investors alike,\u201d he says. \u201cThe consensus seems to have settled around a simple narrative that tariff threats will lead to higher inflation, less monetary easing and a stronger dollar,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cAmid a salvo of \u2018America first\u2019 rhetoric, EM equities have underperformed their US counterparts since the election, while outflows from EM bond funds have accelerated, taking total net withdrawals for 2024 to over $20bn,\u201d Sambor points out.\n\nTrade tariffs are clearly \u201cvery bad news\u201d for emerging market debt, says Mike Riddell, portfolio manager at Fidelity International. But the key question for EM investors, he says, \u201cis just how much of Trump\u2019s tariff narrative is bark, and just how much is bite\u201d.\n\nIf Trump does bite, then some emerging market economies will be hit harder than others. According to proprietary data from asset manager Ninety One, the likes of Malaysia, Czech Republic, Hungary, China and Mexico would be hardest hit, while Argentina, Israel, Kenya, Egypt and Uganda would suffer the least.\n\nMarket commentators suggest bond investors will need to focus on resilient markets with low external debt and strong domestic consumption.\n\n\u201cThe form and timing of US tariffs is obviously very hard to predict and, ultimately, it is the detail that will matter,\u201d says Grant Webster, co-head of emerging market sovereign debt at Ninety One. \u201cBut the economies most exposed are those in which trade forms a large part of their GDPs, and those that run large surpluses to the US.\u201d\n\nHe predicts those likely to gain \u2014 or, at least, to lose out less \u2014 are the Latin American economies aside from Mexico, which are more closed off and have less exposure to Europe and China via their supply chains.\n\n\u201cThink of Argentina, for example, which has a low level of exports to the US and a relatively closed economy,\u201d Webster says. \u201cAnother notable winner is India. India, given its enormous domestic economy, has low exports to the US relative to GDP, is relatively closed, runs a high services balance, and is not deeply integrated into global supply chains.\u201d\n\nGibson-Moore concurs. \u201cIndia will emerge as a safe haven,\u201d he predicts. \u201cDespite the very real risks of a Trump administration, there are opportunities. Emerging markets with strong domestic fundamentals are better positioned to weather the storm.\u201d\n\nIndeed, many commentators believe the naysayers are being overly pessimistic given that investors have more information on what to expect from Trump this time around compared with 2016.\n\nAnd, even then, there were several positives from the first Trump administration for emerging markets, recalls Carlos Carranza, portfolio manager at asset manager Allianz Global Investors.\n\n\u201cFirst, despite the volatility seen in EM assets over the first Trump administration, the returns for EM bonds were solid,\u201d he says. \u201cDollar-denominated sovereign bonds delivered close to 25 per cent over the 2016 to 2019 period and, in fact, outperformed US high yield and US investment grade bonds.\u201d\n\nToday, he believes the macroeconomic outlook remains constructive for emerging markets, with GDP growth in the US showing resiliency and the US Federal Reserve still committed to lowering interest rates.\n\nMark Mobius, chair of Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund, agrees. \u201cWe expect there will be a revival of the US economy, which will be good for almost all nations, including emerging markets.\u201d\n\nAlan Siow, Ninety One\u2019s co-head of emerging market corporate debt, adds that investors will be able to take comfort from the familiar and the fact \u201cwe have seen this movie before\u201d.\n\n\u201cDuring the previous Trump administration, various tariffs and trade policy tools were threatened against China, for example,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, in respect of China, despite a material increase in effective tariff rates, the economic impact was muted.\u201d", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/463e0810-f118-45a2-9a91-1110bd44ed67"}}, {"id": "9ffd0bde-de7a-4b86-9453-542411384381", "event_name": "The blue states vs Donald Trump", "blurb": "Looming legal battles with the new administration will make lawyers rich and business more complicated ", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "The idea of \u201ctwo Americas,\u201d one rich and one poor, one blue and the other red, has been around for decades. But now, thanks to Donald Trump, there are about to be fifty Americas.\n\nAs fast as the new president can sign executive orders, individual state governments are stepping up to challenge them in court. The upshot will be a more confusing environment for business \u2014 and a richer one for lawyers \u2014 as blue states look for ways to shield themselves from immigration raids, weaker environmental regulations, Big Tech monopoly power and massive cuts in federal aid for everything from healthcare to emergency relief.\n\nThe lawsuits, which were rife during Trump\u2019s first term, began again last week as Massachusetts, New Jersey and California led a group of 18 states in filing a challenge to the president\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship. Four other states filed a similar suit. As Massachusetts attorney-general Andrea Joy Campbell put it, \u201cbirthright citizenship\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009is a guarantee of equality, born out of a collective fight against oppression\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It is a settled right in our Constitution and recognised by the Supreme Court for more than a century.\u201d\n\nWhile one can only hope that today\u2019s conservative court won\u2019t approve a modern-day version of the 1857 Dred Scott decision that prohibited citizenship for enslaved people, the battle will be expensive and protracted. Ironically, a series of rulings made by the Supreme Court at the end of 2023 actually make it much easier for individuals, businesses and aggrieved states to take on the federal government.\n\nBlue state governments are, for example, taking charge of many of the monopoly fights waged by the Biden administration. Minnesota\u2019s progressive attorney-general Keith Ellison has replaced former Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan as the face of the war on predatory ticket prices, algorithmic manipulation of real estate markets, grocery monopolies and rent-seeking pharmaceutical companies.\n\nStates will also be ground zero for the rollback of climate legislation, including Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which Trump insists on calling the Green New Deal. While the president may seek to rebrand some of the provisions that benefited red states as his own, he\u2019s dumping subsidies for things like electric vehicles.\n\nCalifornia is preparing for the coming climate battle. Between 2017 and 2021, the state sued the Trump administration 123 times, racking up several wins against environmental deregulation, albeit mostly on administrative grounds. This time around, the Trump administration has experience and better bureaucratic chops. California has already withdrawn several requests that it had been granted under the Biden administration to enforce its own higher pollution restrictions. And Trump is threatening to withhold federal disaster relief for LA unless the state changes its water management, blaming conservation efforts for the city\u2019s inability to get fires under control.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has requested $25mn from the state budget to cover expected litigation costs from battling Trump. The state will also use the power of its own enormous economy (the fifth largest in the world) to try and cut deals with big companies that meet its own clean energy standards, as it did with major global automakers during the first Trump tenure.\n\nThis is an important point. The blue states are home to most of the country\u2019s biggest and richest consumers. They can create strong demand signals for the rest of the country, even if the president doesn\u2019t like it. When the New York City Housing Authority, for example, decides to adopt a certain kind of window, it can set industry standards for years. When California or New York or Illinois or Massachusetts select a certain kind of technology platform for public education systems, or a particular food safety rule, or a certain approach to labour and AI, it can tip the balance of what companies do.\n\nOf course, the economic pull of doing business in such places will also be balanced against the regulatory burdens they impose, particularly relative to red states that will be happy to adopt Trump\u2019s deregulatory, laissez-faire agenda. A friend of mine with a small business recently spent a year and tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees trying to safely fire a lazy and potentially litigious person she\u2019d hired in California who worked remotely. Her replacement is from business-friendly Tennessee.\n\nHistorically, US states tend to band together best when fighting against something, and this time is no different. Last November, Illinois governor JB Pritzker and Colorado governor Jared Polis created a new group called Governors Safeguarding Democracy, with the aim of pooling resources to combat the Trump agenda. Pritzker, for example, has said he won\u2019t co-operate if Trump tries to use red state National Guard units for deportations in blue states. Would California send resources to help?\n\nHere\u2019s hoping such questions remain the stuff of dystopian films. The reality is that blue states, many of which have big deficits, will have to find ways to cope with less fiscal support from Washington. Conservatives are already calling for a new kind of fiscal federalism, blaming overgrown state budgets for the national debt problem. No prizes for guessing where the first cuts will be made.\n\nrana.foroohar@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/11ce0088-7863-4113-b90f-61d438d026bd"}}, {"id": "da412ea3-c442-4a7e-9852-20646b2fb3d6", "event_name": "Fixed income investors seek ways to navigate a Trump presidency", "blurb": "US Treasuries, traditionally a haven asset, have become a riskier, more volatile bet", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "The sharp sell-off in US bonds may not yet be over, say fund managers and analysts, as they try to work out the longer-term impact of President Donald Trump and his policies on Treasury yields and prices.\n\nInvestors have already seen the yield on the 10-year Treasury rise from as little as 3.6 per cent in mid-September to about 4.8 per cent this month \u2014 its highest level since November 2023 \u2014 before falling back, slightly, to about 4.64 per cent. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\n\nThese moves have been driven, in part, by the so-called \u201cTrump trade\u201d, as investors started to price in an election victory for the Republican candidate and resulting policies that could add further fuel to an inflation rate already above target.\n\nWith yields of 5 per cent being talked about as a possibility by some commentators \u2014 and little clarity on how Trump will pursue his plans for trade tariffs, tax cuts and deportations of illegal immigrants \u2014 many see little reason to call an end to the rises just yet.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to get in the way of the rise in US Treasury yields right now as it could be based upon markets testing a shift to a new regime, as Trump [tariff] threats are taken more seriously,\u201d explained TS Lombard chief economist Freya Beamish, in a recent note.\n\nStrong jobs market data and above-target inflation have added to jitters among investors.

On the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred Personal Consumption Expenditure measure, inflation was 2.4 per cent in November \u2014 still above the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target.\n\nThese metrics means that, for many fund managers, Treasuries \u2014 traditionally seen as a haven asset \u2014 are a riskier, more volatile bet than in the past.\n\n\u201cInvestors are demanding more compensation to hold an asset class that has more uncertainty,\u201d says Matthew Morgan, head of fixed income at Jupiter Asset Management. \u201cInflation is not going away as quickly \u2014 that\u2019s the primary problem. The starter of this move was as much [the inflation] data as Trump.\u201d\n\nMany investors remain concerned about the federal budget deficit, which grew under former president Joe Biden to $1.8tn in the year to September \u2014 or more than 6 per cent of US GDP. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office forecast it would hit $2.6tn by 2034.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s plan to cut the deficit to 3 per cent, and his appointment of Elon Musk to head a project to slash the size of the state, many commentators expect the deficit to grow under the new president. This has raised concerns about the amount of bond issuance required.\n\n\u201cThe US [deficit] is wide,\u201d says Mitch Reznick, group head of fixed income in London at Federated Hermes. \u201cIt can generally operate wider than other jurisdictions, but there are limits to that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still a little bit wary of the long end in bonds, [until] we see catalysts of growth and deficits under control,\u201d he adds.\n\nGreg Venizelos, fixed-income strategist at St James\u2019s Place, cites \u201cthe uncertainty we\u2019ve seen surrounding Trump 2.0\u201d as a factor behind the surge in yields, and says the firm\u2019s house view is to be neutral on government bonds.\n\nHowever, some investors have been using the sell-off as an opportunity to buy. Jupiter\u2019s Morgan says that the firm\u2019s fund managers have, on balance, been increasing their positions in longer-term bonds more sensitive to moves in interest rates.\n\n\u201cGovernment bonds look attractively priced right now,\u201d he suggests. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to make money on a 12- to 24-month view, but you\u2019re going to take some volatility.\u201d\n\nFund managers have also been trying to take advantage of the upheaval in the Treasury market by betting on the steepening of the yield curve, as yields on longer maturity debt have risen relative to those on shorter-term bonds. Traders can profit by betting on shorter-term debt prices rising while betting against longer-term bonds.\n\nThe so-called term premium \u2014 the extra return for investors for taking on interest rate risk over longer periods \u2014 has risen to its highest level since 2014, according to data from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe recent move in 10-year bonds globally, which steepened yield curves around the world, has been \u201cspectacular\u201d, wrote Natixis, in a note to clients.\n\nFederated Hermes\u2019 Reznick and fund managers under Jupiter\u2019s Morgan are among those to have run \u2018steepener\u2019 trades. Michael Krautzberger at Allianz Global Investors has also had such trades on, and has taken some profits.\n\nBut, while Treasury moves have been dramatic, some commentators believe certain threats to the market posed by Trump could prove to be overblown. For example, plans to introduce widespread tariffs may be scaled back, as indicated by some of the president\u2019s comments since his inauguration.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we see scope for a [trade] deal to be done avoiding materialisation of these threat[s]\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. providing opportunities for a reprieve,\u201d said TS Lombard\u2019s Beamish last week.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0e1df0c7-c431-42e6-8e02-79dfaeb31c56"}}, {"id": "10cc8fee-2f30-40e0-b87e-90ef7e78b308", "event_name": "US pauses tariffs on Colombia after deal on deportations", "blurb": "Bogot\u00e1 had turned back American planes carrying deported migrants", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "The Trump administration said it was pausing punitive tariffs against Colombia after its leader agreed to grant entry to US military flights deporting migrants.\n\nThe announcement appeared to head off a trade war between the two allies after Colombia denied entry to two US military aircraft carrying deportees on Sunday.

He also said the Colombian presidential plane would be made available to facilitate the arrival of the migrants denied entry on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to receive Colombian men and women who return as deportees, guaranteeing them dignified conditions as citizens with rights,\u201d Murillo said.\n\nThe row erupted when Petro declared in a post on X that the deported migrants should be treated with \u201cdignity and respect\u201d and that Colombia had turned away US military aircraft carrying deportees.\n\nTrump responded by accusing Petro in a post on Truth Social of jeopardising \u201cthe National Security and Public Safety of the United States\u201d.\n\nHe announced emergency 25 per cent tariffs that would increase to 50 per cent in a week, alongside a travel ban and \u201cimmediate visa revocations\u201d for Colombian government officials \u201cand all allies and supporters\u201d.\n\nWill Freeman, a fellow for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted that Colombia sends almost a third of its exports to the US \u201cso this emergency tariff and the threat to raise it further is serious\u201d.\n\nTrump has promised to carry out the largest mass deportation of illegal migrants in US history, alarming the estimated 11mn undocumented immigrants in the US and countries in the region.\n\nBrazil\u2019s government has condemned as \u201cdegrading\u201d the use of handcuffs on its nationals aboard a deportation flight from the US. Bras\u00edlia said it stopped a flight from continuing to its final destination of Belo Horizonte because of the cuffs, the \u201cpoor condition\u201d of the aircraft and the \u201canger\u201d of the 88 Brazilian citizens over their \u201cundignified treatment\u201d.\n\nBrazil\u2019s justice minister said there had been \u201cflagrant disrespect for the fundamental rights of Brazilian citizens\u201d.\n\nThough Colombia and the US have long been close allies \u2014 with Washington providing about $10bn in military and foreign aid to Bogot\u00e1 to fight insurgents and drug traffickers between 1999 and 2016 \u2014 Trump and Petro are ideologically opposed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for Petro and a lot of Latin American leaders to show resistance to this policy on migration,\u201d said Sergio Guzm\u00e1n, director of Colombia Risk Analysis, a Bogot\u00e1-based consultancy. \u201cPetro is trying to show force and to project an ideological difference with Trump.\u201d\n\nThe flow of migrants north through the Dari\u00e9n Gap, a treacherous stretch of jungle that separates Colombia and Panama, has dropped 40 per cent in the past year to 302,000, according to Panama\u2019s foreign ministry, following a crackdown by Panamanian authorities.\n\nBut many migrants used legal pathways opened by the Biden administration to cross into the US and the overall migrant numbers are still near recent record highs.\n\nMexico is negotiating with the US over immigration and drugs to try to avoid a 25 per cent tariff on its exports to the US from next week.\n\nMexican president Claudia Sheinbaum has stressed that while she does not agree with the deportations, Mexico will co-operate with the US and have a \u201cgood\u201d relationship with the Trump administration.\n\nAdditional reporting by Steff Ch\u00e1vez in Washington", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2a9dc578-6d93-429e-a4f8-ad725812e9c0"}}, {"id": "ea8f58ef-c371-425d-be52-d0652ea09043", "event_name": "Dana Perino: the Fox News host ready for Trump 2.0", "blurb": "Presenter whose colleagues are in line to join the new cabinet says the US is in the midst of \u2018political realignment\u2019", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "Dana Perino is clear about whether she will be getting a call to join the Trump administration. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she says firmly. She is behind her desk on the Manhattan set of America\u2019s Newsroom, one of the Fox News shows she presents. Normally she is the one asking the questions but the cameras have stopped rolling and this morning is the FT\u2019s turn to be interrogator.\n\nIs she sure she won\u2019t get a call? Three of Perino\u2019s Fox News colleagues are in line for positions in Donald Trump\u2019s new cabinet: Pete Hegseth, a former host at the channel, was confirmed as defence secretary at the weekend; Tulsi Gabbard, a Fox contributor and former Democratic congresswoman turned Republican, has been put forward as director of national intelligence; while Sean Duffy, a host on Fox Business, has received the nod for transportation secretary.\n\nFox News has had a rocky few years, settling a $787.5mn defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems in 2023, over on-air claims the company helped rig the 2020 election for Joe Biden (an additional $2.7bn defamation suit from another voting system group, Smartmatic, is pending). Yet the network beloved by conservatives remains the most watched cable news channel in the US, routinely trouncing rivals CNN and MSNBC in the ratings. Many of its presenters share a worldview with Trump: Tucker Carlson, a former Perino colleague and bogeyman of liberals everywhere, does not have an official role but is known to have regular conversations with the new US president. National Public Radio recently calculated that for his second term, Trump has given jobs to at least 19 past and present hosts, journalists and commentators from the network, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox Corp.\n\nPerino would be a natural choice to join them, given her experience as White House press secretary under George W Bush. In that role, which she held for two years, she sustained an injury to her eye in the melee that followed an Iraqi journalist throwing a shoe at the then president.\n\nBut the 52-year-old says there is only one position that would persuade her to return to government. \u201cThe only job I would want\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009would be ambassador to Tanzania,\u201d she says, slightly unexpectedly. Africa holds a special place in her heart, she explains: she worked with Bush on the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) and, together with her husband, has spent time volunteering on its west coast since she left the White House in 2009.\n\nHer internationalist view and belief in the importance of overseas aid is a far cry from Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d isolationism. \u201cI\u2019m not against investment in other places, where it makes sense, if you\u2019re actually getting results and if you have national security interests that can be advanced. Because guess what? If we don\u2019t, China [will].\u201d\n\nPerino, it seems, is cut from a different conservative cloth than the man who now sits in the Oval Office. \u201cI just want everybody to get along,\u201d the Colorado native says at one point (imagine Trump ever saying that). She is less shouty than some of her Fox News colleagues who present evening opinion shows, such as chief Trump cheerleader Sean Hannity.\n\nFox and Trump have had a turbulent relationship over the years. Despite the network\u2019s biggest stars tending to share a hatred of the Democratic party \u2014 even though it now attracts a larger share of the Democrat audience than rivals such as CNN, according to Nielsen \u2014 the president has at various times accused the channel of being unfair to him or having an anti-Trump agenda. Which begs the question: given some of his more alarming policies (releasing convicted criminals who attacked the Capitol on January 6, being one) is Trump now to the right of Fox News? \u201cIt depends on what the right means now,\u201d Perino says, diplomatically.\n\nThe US is in the midst of a \u201cpolitical realignment\u201d, she adds, going on to mention previous eras, such as the 1970s, when southern Democrats drifted away from the party, eventually becoming Reagan Republicans. Today\u2019s Democrats have \u201clet the working class go\u201d, while Trump \u201cis a political phenomenon. I\u2019m certainly a conservative. I\u2019m a registered Republican. Would people that work for him consider me one of them? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWhat is Trump\u2019s relationship with Fox like these days? \u201cIt might depend on the day.\u201d She adds that his second term certainly will not be boring. \u201cI remember on a Saturday [in his first term] I took a nap for 20 minutes. That was it, and I woke up and three news stories had broken. During the Biden administration you could nap all day.\u201d\n\nFox News was the first outlet to raise questions about Biden\u2019s age affecting his mental acuity, which earned the channel the ire of Democrats. The great irony is that the Democrats are now beating themselves up over why he did not step down sooner, which would have allowed a proper primary to find the strongest candidate to run in his place.\n\n\u201cIt was what you were seeing with your own eyes,\u201d Perino says of Biden\u2019s decline. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t speculation. You could just see it when he would interact or when he would talk with the press. It was a problem.\u201d\n\nI wonder if Fox\u2019s reporting on this issue failed to take off in other parts of the press (Fox commentators tend to lump all other outlets together as the \u201cmainstream media\u201d) precisely because it came from the Murdoch-controlled channel and could therefore be dismissed as politically motivated.\n\nBut Perino changes tack to the campaign itself. \u201cThe other thing that was happening was that every poll said inflation is the number one issue for people, followed by immigration, and then crime. The voters were telling them what was wrong.\n\n\u201cClimate change might be the number one issue for 7 per cent of your voters,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf you focus on that solely and ignore these other things, ultimately you\u2019re going to lose.\u201d\n\nPerino then brings up border security. \u201cThe White House [would be] saying the border is secure and [Fox would have a] split-screen of people just walking across it. They missed that too. That really affected people.\u201d\n\nThe border is now the responsibility of the new administration, which continues to be assembled by Trump. At the time of publication only Marco Rubio\u2019s Senate confirmation as secretary of state has been smooth. Hegseth\u2019s nomination in particular sparked an outcry, with several news outlets publishing stories on alleged excessive drinking and aggressive behaviour: the Wall Street Journal, which, like Fox, is part of the Murdoch empire, recently reported he routinely passed out from alcohol abuse. (Hegseth has denied the allegations.)\n\nPerino says she \u201cnever worked with him that closely\u201d, adding the allegations \u201cdon\u2019t ring true to anything that I\u2019ve ever experienced. \u2018Give Pete a chance\u2019 is something I said that first day [he was nominated]. I know it\u2019s been a lot on his family, just from afar.\u201d\n\nShe went through a Senate confirmation process herself in 2010 when Barack Obama nominated her to join the Broadcasting Board of Governors. It was not \u201cvery controversial\u201d, she says of the experience, \u201cbut it\u2019s still a thing when your whole world is opened up to everybody\u201d.\n\nSince then, Perino\u2019s Fox career has grown and evolved: alongside America\u2019s Newsroom, which she co-anchors with Bill Hemmer, she is a co-host of the primetime show The Five, the most watched cable news show at 5pm. She has also developed Minute Mentoring, an organisation that helps women build leadership skills and advance their careers. She describes the approach as \u201clike speed dating, but mentoring\u201d.\n\nShe mentions a piece of advice she has given. \u201cI tell people, you\u2019re only allowed to have one drink at your office Christmas party. I don\u2019t care if you think you can handle four, you can\u2019t. One drink, that\u2019s it.\u201d Why? \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make a fool of yourself. You want to have a good showing in front of your boss at all times.\u201d Maybe Hegseth could have done with this advice, I suggest. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says sharply. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him drinking.\u201d\n\nOur time is almost up and before we part I want to know again where an internationalist conservative, who believes we have more common ground than we might think, fits in the new Trump era. \u201cI try to show people that we actually don\u2019t disagree that much,\u201d says Perino, referring again to the great political realignment wrought by the election result. There are some Trump policies that have merit, she adds, pointing to the need to drive more spending by Nato members and her view that the Department of Education needs reform to deliver better outcomes for children. But it does not sound like she has become a full-blown Maga member just yet.\n\nShe is ready for Trump 2.0 \u2014 and Fox News, she says, is the perfect perch. \u201cI think the great thing for me is I can just be myself.\u201d", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3e2ab3ad-bc9c-46d5-b360-4876c10feeb9"}}, {"id": "76244992-286a-4382-974f-7d8830548545", "event_name": "US agents begin arresting undocumented migrants in Chicago", "blurb": "Operation in Democrat-controlled \u2018sanctuary city\u2019 is part of Donald Trump\u2019s plan for mass deportations", "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0", "body": "US immigration authorities began making arrests in Chicago on Sunday that targeted undocumented residents living in the \u201csanctuary city\u201d.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed on social media site X that its agents, along with several federal agencies including the FBI, had begun operations in the Midwestern city.

They may want to revise that view if the rollercoaster ride that is TikTok, now hurtling through the tunnel of the living dead, crashes into the buffers. Even big multinational companies, with 170mn enthusiastic users in the US, can become the plaything of politicians. And it is still far from clear how the saga is going to end.\n\nIronically, given his recent support for the company, Donald Trump was among the first to shout about the national security threat posed by TikTok during his first presidential term. In 2020, Trump issued an executive order threatening to ban the service. As the US offshoot of the Chinese-owned ByteDance, TikTok was seen by many politicians in Washington as a digital spy and potential Chinese Communist party propaganda tool. TikTok has since spent enormous time and resources on efforts to disprove these accusations, partnering with Oracle to ringfence the data of its US users and insisting on the impartiality of its algorithms.\n\nPoliticians on both sides of the congressional aisle have remained unimpressed. Last April, in a rare display of bipartisanship, the Senate voted, by a margin of 79 to 18, to approve legislation threatening to ban TikTok in the US unless ByteDance sold it. TikTok lobbied vigorously to overturn the law, arguing it would erode free speech and the business interests of millions of Americans.\n\nThis month, the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the company\u2019s pleas, backing Congress\u2019s \u201cwell-supported national security concerns\u201d. China has reacted with indignation, but Beijing itself firewalled most US platforms years ago, also ostensibly on national security grounds.\n\nBut TikTok had more success mobilising the support of its users and winning over the once-hostile Trump. Last June, the then presidential candidate launched his own TikTok account and now has more than 15mn followers. He has skilfully used the short-form video platform to target younger voters. TikTok\u2019s chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, was even given a prominent seat at Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nUpon re-entering the White House, Trump issued an executive order seeking to delay enforcement of the ban-or-divest law against TikTok that came into effect on January 19. But this executive order does not overturn the law, leaving the company, and the US platforms that host it, in legal limbo. Meanwhile, Trump appears to be using TikTok as a valuable pawn in a far bigger game with China. The president has suggested that if Beijing were to sell 50 per cent of TikTok to the US \u2014 though China has previously refused to countenance any kind of sale \u2014 then Washington might go easier on trade tariffs.\n\nIt is possible that Trump may yet seal an improbable deal keeping all parties happy. But it is hard to see how that will happen given the demands of China hawks in Washington to nullify any national security threat and TikTok\u2019s determination to keep its algorithms secret. The more likely outcome is that the president will try to strong-arm the business into the hands of an administration-friendly associate. Trump said this weekend that \u201cnumerous people\u201d had talked to him about buying the app and a decision was likely in the next 30 days.\n\nLast week, Trump urged global business leaders at Davos to step up investment in the US. But his history of highly transactional dealings will give them pause. Investors understandably prefer to operate within the bounds defined by laws, rights and institutions. The outcome of the TikTok dispute will show how far these still apply in the US.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0b21728f-1e6b-43c6-882e-ef8454f00940"}}, {"id": "08d80179-21b1-40f1-8aa3-7f2807faa0ca", "event_name": "Europe should stop panicking and seize the opportunities Trump offers", "blurb": "It is time for the EU to get down to business", "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0", "body": "FT readers are old enough to remember when Joe Biden committed hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to green technology \u2014 and Europe panicked. In the past week, Donald Trump has undone Biden\u2019s industrial policy, while promising huge investments in AI and fossil energy instead \u2014 and Europe is panicking again. No matter what a US president does, it seems, Europeans see an existential crisis.\n\nThis should give us some perspective on the \u201cpeak pessimism\u201d expressed in Davos. Perhaps, just perhaps, it reflects European attitudes more than it does the EU\u2019s objective prospects. That is not to deny that Trump\u2019s second administration will pose huge challenges to the bloc\u2019s economic and geopolitical model. But that model was already ripe for change. It would suit the EU to be more entrepreneurial about its fears, and use Trump\u2019s arrival as a source of opportunities \u2014 both to make it easier to make the changes that are long overdue, and to benefit from the harm the US is about to inflict on itself.\n\nStart with trade. Trump wants to shrink the US trade deficit with the EU. European leaders want to increase investment at home. These desires amount to the same thing. As EU leaders increasingly acknowledge, the EU\u2019s trade surplus is also a huge savings surplus exported to finance investments abroad. The penny needs to drop: redirecting these savings to domestic investments means leaving behind a growth model driven by export surpluses.\n\nThe understandable European instinct is to placate Trump and hope to salvage their US market access. But this instinct is obsolete. Learn instead from the more clear-eyed (everything is relative) strategy towards China: de-risk, though not decouple. The probable next German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, rightly warns companies reliant on China that they have to face the risks of disruption on their own. The same mindset can be extended to the US.\n\nThen there is defence. Europeans have to spend a lot more on this \u2014 not because the US president says so, but because Russian belligerence threatens their freedom. Trump\u2019s demand to raise defence spending to 5 per cent of GDP can, however, be the prod needed to break through political inertia, by shifting the question from whether to spend substantially more to how.\n\nIn the short run, this means more weapons purchases from US manufacturers \u2014 an easy promise to trade for other favours in Washington. In the medium run, ironically, it could lead to the opposite, as European arms producers get the certainty of sustained and higher demand \u2014 especially if their governments finally manage to standardise specifications and procure jointly.\n\nEnergy is next. The EU struggles with high energy prices, and hasn\u2019t managed to give up Russian pipeline oil and liquefied gas. Trump would like nothing more than boosting oil and gas sales to Europe. The quickest way to achieve this would be to complete the EU\u2019s sanctions against buying Russian fossil fuels \u2014 but this requires unanimity, which Russia-friendly member states resist. The smart thing to do is request a helping hand from Trump by pointing out that it\u2019s his own admirers, from Budapest to Bratislava, who stand in the way of a bigger order book.\n\nIn addition to a political springboard to realise existing European priorities, Trump\u2019s disruption also offers new opportunities to exploit. If Biden\u2019s subsidies for renewables and green tech sucked investment from Europe to the US, then today\u2019s about-face must logically do the opposite. More likely, those fears were always overdone. But the Maga antipathy for anything green strengthens the case for doubling down on incentives to make more profitable in Europe the decarbonisation investments that have just become less profitable in the US.\n\nThink about immigration, too. For a long time Europe has bled talent to the US, and the shortage of qualified staff is a common complaint from high-tech businesses. If Maga America proves too extreme for the world\u2019s young well-educated workers (and the UK remains neuralgic about immigration), an EU that throws its doors open could become a global pole of attraction. High-skilled immigration schemes that allow movement between EU states, such as the Blue Card initiative, should be enhanced, perhaps in conjunction with the pan-European legal framework for innovative companies that European tech has asked for and Brussels has promised to deliver.\n\nEurope should heed the words of an earlier US president: it has nothing to fear but fear itself. The best response to Trumpian aggression is to use it to make Europe great again.\n\nmartin.sandbu@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/05a41924-b5be-41dd-aaae-89121b4ac146"}}, {"id": "a6242bf8-5750-4022-b737-164bab203b9c", "event_name": "Will the Federal Reserve respond to Donald Trump\u2019s call on interest rates?", "blurb": "Market Questions is the FT\u2019s guide to the week ahead", "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0", "body": "The Federal Reserve is not expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday but the US central bank\u2019s policy is already under scrutiny from President Donald Trump.\n\nInvestors overwhelmingly expect the Fed to hold rates at their current level of 4.25-4.5 per cent, after three consecutive cuts since September.\n\nAttention will focus on any shift in outlook from the accompanying statement, and on remarks from chair Jay Powell in the subsequent press conference.\n\nIn December the Fed signalled a likely pause in rate cuts and said it would consider the \u201cextent and timing\u201d of any further changes. Since then, data has shown slowing inflation and solid jobs growth \u2014 a combination that has sparked debate over the need for, and timing of, any further rate cuts.\n\n\u201cIf the [Fed] wanted to send a further hawkish signal in January, this sentence could be modified again,\u201d said HSBC US economist Ryan Wang. \u201cWe expect the Fed to refrain from sending such a signal, but this is a hawkish risk.\u201d\n\nBut Powell is likely to face questions on early actions and comments from Trump, who this week said he would demand that interest rates drop.

If confirmed, that would be the fifth such reduction since June and would take the key deposit rate to 2.75 per cent, the lowest level in almost two years and 1.25 percentage points lower than at its peak in 2024.\n\nIn doing so, markets expect the ECB to discount December\u2019s jump in annual inflation back to 2.4 per cent. It is confident that annual price increases this year will be close to its medium-term target of 2 per cent, while economic growth is likely to disappoint.\n\nBut almost half of the 72 participants in a Financial Times survey among European economists said that the ECB had been too slow in lowering rates.\n\n\u201cWe do not see ourselves behind the curve,\u201d Lagarde told CNBC in an interview in Davos this week where she attended the World Economic Forum.\n\nTraders are expecting two or three further quarter-point cuts this year, according to levels implied by swaps markets.\n\nWith the US Fed becoming much more hawkish in December, a growing transatlantic gap in monetary policy appears to be opening up.\n\nLagarde told CNBC that the ECB was not \u201coverly concerned\u201d about potential repercussions for Europe from a potential uptick in inflation in the US. Olaf Storbeck\n\nTraders are widely expecting the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates by a quarter point at Wednesday\u2019s policy-setting meeting but a small question mark remains, given recent trends in economic data.\n\nSwaps markets are pricing in a 90 per cent probability the central bank will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3 per cent from 3.25 per cent.\n\nBut when the Bank of Canada took half a percentage point off its overnight rate in December for the second meeting in a row, responding to weaker than expected economic growth, deliberations from its governing council showed that the decision between a quarter-point and half-point cut was a \u201cclose call\u201d given mixed data and noted the \u201csubstantial\u201d cumulation of recent reductions.\n\nMembers would be evaluating the need for further reductions in the policy rate \u201cone meeting at a time\u201d, the bank said in a summary of their deliberations, and \u201cexpected a more gradual approach to monetary policy going forward\u201d.\n\nData since then show that Canada\u2019s economy was growing \u201croughly in line\u201d with the central bank\u2019s forecast, according to Capital Economics. It also highlighted inflation data for December, that while including a decline to 1.8 per cent in the headline rate, indicated that a measure of underlying inflation trends was \u201cuncomfortably high\u201d.\n\nSuch pressures could give the central bank, which has also cited uncertainty created by the new US administration, the grounds to pause its rate cuts.\n\n\u201cWith tariffs clouding the economic outlook, we judge that the governing council will opt for a [quarter-point] policy rate cut,\u201d said Thomas Ryan, North America economist at Capital Economics.

The means to unlock that money are now unclear and may get tangled up in broader congressional negotiations to revise the IRA.\n\nWilliam Oplinger, chief executive of US aluminium producer Alcoa, said his company\u2019s two domestic smelters could be at risk if tax credits were cut.\n\nThe support \u201chas allowed those facilities to continue operating in the current environment\u201d, he said, adding that the company would determine their long-term viability when it was clear what any IRA changes would mean and if there were additional impacts from tariffs.\n\nWind power took a particularly heavy blow as a result of orders that froze leasing approvals and triggered immediate review of permitting practices, which cover existing projects.\n\nSome companies are racing to appoint Republican-linked lobbying firms they hope have the ear of the administration. Federal disclosures show renewable energy developers EnergyRe and NextEra hired Polaris Government Relations last month.\n\nTrump\u2019s energy orders bore resemblance to a five-point road map proposed last summer by the American Petroleum Institute, the fossil fuel producers\u2019 lobby group. Mike Sommers, API chief executive, said the institute was now moving to influence the implementation of policy.\n\n\u201cA lot of these executive orders are directing agencies to do things, but many of these agencies don\u2019t even have secretaries now,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is fill in the blanks for the new department heads, so they know precisely how to implement the president\u2019s vision.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump did not fulfil a promise to impose new tariffs on US trading partners on \u201cday one\u201d, an executive memo ordered departmental reviews of existing trade practices, with a deadline of April 1. He also indicated at a press conference that he could hit Mexico, Canada and China with tariffs on February 1.\n\nEvan Giesemann, an adviser on tax and trade at EY, told clients in a Wednesday webinar: \u201cWhile nothing with President Trump is final until it is implemented\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I can\u2019t underscore enough how wide a net this memo casts, showing how serious he is about making structural changes to our trade policies and fairly quickly.\u201d\n\nIn some quarters, the executive actions crystallised concern that new tariffs, along with the potential deportation of a portion of the US labour force, could stoke inflation and limit the Federal Reserve\u2019s room to cut interest rates.\n\nCarole Streicher, deal advisory leader for KPMG in the US, suspected that concern was behind the spike this week in incoming calls from private equity-owned companies about starting a sale process.\n\n\u201cMany are sitting on the starting line ready to have the gun go off,\u201d she said. \u201cThe discussion now is whether there is a short window for the next three to six months where interest rates are going to be at their current level and we need to transact before that window closes.\u201d\n\nThe executive actions also appear likely to accelerate companies\u2019 recasting of diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. Trump ordered government agencies to draw up lists of \u201cthe most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners in each sector of concern\u201d and propose \u201cup to nine potential civil compliance investigations\u201d of public companies and other organisations.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re bullying American employers into backing away from what are otherwise fully lawful efforts,\u201d said Jenny Yang, former commissioner at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, now partner at the consultancy Working Ideal.\n\nYang said many companies had examined their DEI policies to check they were watertight, but law firms were sending urgent bulletins to clients offering legal audits. The retailer Target on Friday became the latest company to row back previous DEI commitments.\n\nTD Cowen\u2019s Krueger said this week\u2019s executive actions had come \u201cat record speed and with record breadth\u201d, with much still to digest and many questions unanswered. \u201cBut at least now pre-season is over,\u201d he said. \u201cNow you can start putting pen to paper on policy.\u201d", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3af7a758-d161-4dc7-998f-8872f17cf617"}}, {"id": "875ae129-4815-4fd4-bcc8-fe367a1ba16e", "event_name": "The world is moving on to trade without the US", "blurb": "Many nations have been responding to Trump tariffs not by retaliating but by courting other trade partners", "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is chair of Rockefeller International. His latest book is \u2018What Went Wrong With Capitalism\u2019\n\nWhile Donald Trump has yet to act on his multiple tariff threats, it\u2019s likely he will. So the fear lingers that the US president\u2019s aggressive trade posture will sow global disorder, depressing growth and roiling markets, particularly if targeted nations retaliate.\n\nBut retaliation is not the only or even the most likely response to Trump, no matter how broadly he finally delivers on his threats.\n\nThe US has wielded tariffs as a weapon for eight years now. Those imposed by Trump in his first term were mostly continued or \u2014 in the case of China \u2014 expanded by Joe Biden. Some nations retaliated; others offered concessions or challenged them before global trade arbiters. But most just quietly moved on, seeking trade with countries other than the US.\n\nSince 2017, Trump\u2019s first year in office, trade has held more or less steady at just under 60 per cent of global GDP. But there\u2019s been a decline in the US share of trade flows offset by an increase in other regions, particularly the nations of Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Trump 2.0 seems likely to bring more of the same: trade without America.\n\nOver the past eight years, more than four of every five nations \u2014 developed and developing \u2014 have seen trade rise as a share of their national GDP. Gains of more than 10 percentage points have been chalked up in more than a dozen major nations, from Japan, Italy and Sweden to Vietnam, Greece and Turkey. The big exception is the US, where it has dipped to around 25 per cent of GDP. The US has been growing faster than most of its peers \u2014 but with no boost from trade.\n\nAmerica may be increasingly dominant as a financial and economic superpower but not so much as a trading power. Its share of global equity indices has exploded to almost 70 per cent. Its share of global GDP has inched up to more than 25 per cent. Yet its share of global trade is under 15 per cent, and has declined significantly in the last eight years.\n\nMany of the warnings about Trump\u2019s impact focus on how new tariffs could hurt exporting nations that rely on the US as their main customer. But during Trump\u2019s first term, before the pandemic and despite his tariff offensive, developed nations saw stable growth and developing ones saw a strong acceleration in exports of both goods (led by tech products and commodities) and services (led by transport and digital services).\n\nGlobal trade talks had fallen apart after 2008, as tensions stirred up by the financial crisis that year made vast multi-nation deals too difficult to conclude. But many nations continued to pursue smaller deals. The number of bilateral and regional agreements rose steadily, with fresh impetus after Trump first took office, and soon styled himself \u201ctariff man\u201d.\n\nThe US became an outlier, looking on as others cultivated the art of the trade deal. Since 2017, the US has abandoned talks on partnerships with the EU and Asia, and cut not a single new trade deal. Meanwhile, the EU has negotiated eight agreements and China has concluded nine, including a landmark 15-nation partnership in Asia.\n\nBy late last year, dealmaking picked up anew as the start of Trump\u2019s second presidency approached. The EU rushed to finish the outline of a difficult agreement \u2014 25 years in the making \u2014 with members of the Mercosur alliance in South America, followed by one with Mexico. Now, Mexico is hurrying to widen trade ties with fellow nations in Latin America, in part as insurance against what Trump might do next.\n\nThe result: over the past eight years, as the locus of global trade shifted away from the US and towards the Middle East, Europe and Asia, nations registering big share gains included the United Arab Emirates, Poland and, above all, China. Of the 10 fastest-growing trade corridors, five have one terminus in China; only two have a terminus in the US.\n\nTrump says tariffs will command respect, and help restore US power. But there\u2019s another risk worth considering. The new president\u2019s brand of populism vows to free the US from heavy government intervention through taxes and regulations, but tariffs are another form \u2014 and equally subject to the laws of unintended consequences.\n\nTo date, the \u201cAmerica first\u201d tariff regime has done less to damage its prime target, China, than to compel US allies to look elsewhere for trade. So the risk of even broader tariffs may be less about triggering trade wars than undermining US relevance as a trading power, and eventually sapping its economic prowess.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/07eac548-6607-4c88-bfe3-4f1d6e3b8cf2"}}, {"id": "2a9ff719-863f-4f38-a2f4-d764cef98854", "event_name": "\u2018Grossly irresponsible\u2019: health experts urge US to control bird flu", "blurb": "Call for stronger action comes on warning of growing risk the virus will evolve to spread more easily between humans", "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0", "body": "The US must strengthen measures to control the country\u2019s bird flu outbreak and curb the growing risk that the virus will evolve to spread more easily between humans, international health experts have warned.\n\nScientists have called for increased vaccination of farm workers and more efforts to stem the spread among farm animals as the H5N1 pathogen continues to infect cattle and chickens across the country.\n\nThe epidemic is an early test for President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, which is already scaling back commitments to global efforts on disease control and prevention.\n\n\u201cIt is arguably grossly irresponsible for the US authorities to allow such sustained high level of virus transmission in dairy cattle as this poses such a major threat to global human health,\u201d said Professor James Wood, an infectious diseases expert at the UK\u2019s Cambridge university.\n\nHe added that curbs such as stricter movement of cattle \u201cwould hugely reduce human exposure and would be expected in every other country\u201d.\n\nExperts have watched with growing alarm as H5N1 has circulated in the US for more than nine months. The outbreak has resulted in 67 confirmed human cases, mostly in people who work with cattle and chickens, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe first fatality was reported this month, although no cases of human to human transmission have yet been documented.\n\nVirologists fear a reassortment of genetic material from the H5N1 pathogen with another animal or human flu, creating a new virus that is more likely to be transmitted between people. The possibility of this scenario rises as H5N1 circulates in the US during the winter flu season.\n\nThere were an estimated 12mn-22mn human flu cases between October 1 and January 11, according to the CDC. On January 16, it urged hospitals to analyse within 24 hours whether flu sufferers actually contracted bird flu, particularly if patients were in intensive care.\u00a0The CDC said in November it had provided human flu vaccines to farm workers in 12 states.\n\nIt considered H5N1\u2019s risk to the public to be low, but added that it was \u201cclosely monitoring this dynamic situation\u201d.\n\nThe World Organisation for Animal Health, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization have said governments should step up several measures to combat the spread of bird flu. These include strengthening virus testing, sequencing and data sharing, improving farm biosecurity and protecting people who were exposed to infected animals, said Maria Van Kerkhove, a top WHO official.\n\n\u201cMore can and should be done to reduce the spread of avian influenza in animals, between different animal species and to humans,\u201d said Van Kerkhove, who is acting director of pandemic preparedness.\n\nThe WHO encourages work on developing animal vaccines and their potential use to reduce bird flu\u2019s spread, Van Kerkhove added.\n\nThe three leading makers of bird flu vaccines for humans \u2014 CSL Seqirus, Sanofi and GSK \u2014 are well placed to respond if the outbreak becomes a pandemic. In October, the trio signed a $72mn agreement with the US government that included commitments to prepare to distribute doses quickly and sustain supply levels.\n\nThe US government on January 17 gave $590mn to Moderna, which is developing a flu vaccine using similar messenger RNA-based technology as its Covid jab.\n\nThe Seqirus jab has been ordered by many European governments but Finland is the only one to have confirmed it is using the vaccines to inoculate farmworkers. The vaccine maker said the Nordic country was also conducting its own independent study on the jab\u2019s safety and efficacy.\n\nThe US response to bird flu has been further complicated by a \u201cshort pause\u201d placed on \u201cmass communications and public appearances that are not directly related to emergencies or critical to preserving health\u201d by the health and human services department and other bodies.\n\nThe Trump administration initiated the pause to \u201cset up a process for review and prioritisation\u201d, the health department said.\n\nTrump and his allies are critical of fundamental aspects of international disease control, while Robert F Kennedy Jr, his nominee for health and human services secretary, is a long-standing vaccine sceptic.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s first actions after his inauguration was to trigger the year-long process to pull the US out of the WHO.\u00a0He took the same action in 2020 during his previous term, but president Joe Biden reversed the decision on taking office in January 2021.\n\nData visualisation by Bob Haslett\n\nThis piece has been updated to clarify the WHO\u2019s position on animal vaccines for bird flu.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8eb284d4-d853-4a0a-a8c0-5173d1a6d666"}}, {"id": "fa312d96-5842-436d-925c-0a2c95531716", "event_name": "US officials push to exempt Ukraine from Rubio\u2019s foreign aid freeze\u00a0", "blurb": "Support for schools, hospitals and economic development in Ukraine at risk from Trump administration\u2019s order", "date": "2025-01-2500:00:00.0", "body": "US diplomats have requested an urgent exemption for Ukraine-related programmes from a 90-day freeze on foreign aid and \u201cstop work\u201d orders issued by secretary of state Marco Rubio, according to documents seen by the Financial Times and people familiar with the matter.\n\nCiting national security concerns, senior diplomats in the state department\u2019s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs have asked Rubio to grant a full waiver to exclude the work of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in Ukraine from the sweeping directive that came into effect immediately after being issued on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe do not know at this time whether this request will be approved \u2014 in whole or in part \u2014 but there are positive signals thus far out of Washington,\u201d said an email sent to USAID staff in Ukraine on Saturday that was reviewed by the FT.\n\nUSAID in Ukraine has temporarily held off issuing \u201cstop work\u201d orders while the exemption request\u00a0is being considered, according to the email and officials at some of those partner organisations.\n\nThe agency has also asked staff to assess programmes \u201cand find ways for them to more clearly support the secretary of state\u2019s directive to make the US safer, stronger and more prosperous\u201d.\n\nBut by Saturday evening in Kyiv, some organisations began receiving \u201cstop work\u201d orders.\n\nOne such order shared by an organisation with the FT ordered \u201cthe contractor to immediately stop work under the USAID/Ukraine contract/task order\u201d the organisation had been awarded.\n\nThe order said the contractor \u201cshall not resume work\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009until notification has been received in writing from the Contracting Officer that this Stop Work Order has been cancelled\u201d.\n\nThe state department, USAID and US embassy in Kyiv did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn an internal cable sent on Friday to the state department and USAID, obtained by the FT, Rubio instructed that all new foreign aid disbursements be suspended.

A young woman \u2014 as far away as India \u2014 feels the pull of Lady Liberty\u2019s lifted torch in New York Harbour and crosses the globe to make a new life. She knows her path won\u2019t be straightforward \u2014 but also that the Big Apple is the place to support and nurture her dreams.\n\nKay Sohini\u2019s graphic memoir This Beautiful, Ridiculous City, is a praise-song to her adopted home.\u00a0Raised in the suburbs of Kolkata and given an English education, the young Sohini read Jack Kerouac, Joan Didion and Alison Bechdel and dreamt always of New York. When she finally moved to the city, leaving behind an abusive relationship, she felt she already belonged. At the same time however, Sohini refuses to look away from the city\u2019s flaws, from the damage its ruthless metamorphoses can inflict.\n\nIn the days before the inauguration of the 47th President of the United States some of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have made their way to the city \u2014 which has a legal obligation to provide shelter to anyone who asks \u2014 have begun to flee, fearing Donald Trump\u2019s threatened deportations. The city, undoubtedly, has creaked under the weight of open-palmed welcome; Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 chaotic administration (with the mayor himself under federal indictment and with many of his top officials having resigned amid a torrent of investigations) hasn\u2019t helped matters.\n\nYet the city that never sleeps has survived plenty worse, and Sohini\u2019s book, with its glorious, candy-coloured drawings of the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station and the Gimbels Skybridge, presents its allure in a fresh, enchanting way, while also offering a reminder that Sohini is one of a long line of women who have found themselves in the city, made their mark, remade themselves. She loves New York for \u201cthe stories it is home to, the creativity it lends to passers-by when the mind is desolate. It is about drawing pleasure from proximity. To possibilities, to art, architecture, culture, history, luxury.\u201d\n\nIn this she is not so far removed from the writer and raconteur Fran Lebowitz \u2014 the professional New Yorker whose fame increased exponentially with the release of Martin Scorsese\u2019s 2021 documentary Pretend It\u2019s a City. As she has it in her author biography: \u201cLebowitz lives in New York City, as she does not believe she would be allowed to live anywhere else.\u201d Lebowitz is of course herself an immigrant to New York, albeit one from just across the river in New Jersey. But to New Yorkers, that\u2019s far enough.\n\nThe struggle to be a New Yorker is real. Although Sohini is captivated by Manhattan, she finds a place to live in Queens, a fair few subway stops from the landmarks she draws with such care and affection. This moving, optimistic book doesn\u2019t shrink from economic reality, as she watches local residents being displaced from her neighbourhood as the outer boroughs gentrify too.\n\n\u201cWith the median house price hovering around $700,000, homeownership is a pipedream to many. Nearly 70% of the city\u2019s eight and a quarter million people are renters.\u201d She draws the facade of a red-brick apartment building, beautifully restored and for that very reason forbidding: \u201cNew York is increasingly a city for the very moneyed,\u201d reads the text that runs across the brick. \u201cIt makes less and less space for those with little or modest means.\u201d\n\nNot long ago, the city seemed \u2014 just \u2014 somewhat more accommodating to those who would see in Lady Liberty not just as a beacon but a mirror too. I read Sohini\u2019s memoir alongside Vivian Gornick\u2019s striking memoir, The Odd Woman and the City \u2014 first published in the US a decade ago, but only now appearing in Britain \u2014 and Elaine Kraf\u2019s eccentric, compelling novel The Princess of 72nd Street. Put all these alongside Virago\u2019s new edition of The Fran Lebowitz Reader and you have a shelf of works that offer a multi-faceted portrait of what it means to be a woman in New York.\n\nGornick, long a writer for the storied Village Voice and the author of Fierce Attachments (lauded as the best memoir of the past 50 years by the New York Times Book Review) takes her title from George Gissing\u2019s 1893 novel The Odd Women \u2014 a proto-feminist text, if you like, considering as it does the costs of \u201crespectability\u201d for women\u2019s lives. Gornick sets her sights on the three elements defining her existence: her reach for friendship, her desire for romantic love and, most powerful of all, the rhythms of the city she calls home.\n\nShe is \u201ca walker in the city\u201d, one of those who feeds \u201cthe never-ending stream of the never-ending crowd that is certainly imprinting on someone\u2019s creativity\u201d. Gornick treks the length of the island with her friend Leonard; along the way she records her encounters and recalls her failed love affairs.\n\nThe streets and avenues sustain her, the risks and possibilities of the place never permitting the finality of despair. At the end of this brief, peculiarly arresting book she sits down to a solitary dinner and recalls all the New Yorkers who have crossed her path that day. \u201cI hear their voices, I see their gestures, I start filling in lives for them. Soon they are company, great company.\u201d In New York, phantom companionship is companionship all the same.\n\nGornick quotes a letter by the poet and critic Louise Bogan that describes the West 70s in Manhattan as \u201cthat area which absorbs the queer, the old, the failures, into furnished or hotel rooms, and adds gloom to their decay\u201d. Like so much of Manhattan, this part of the Upper West Side has been ruthlessly gentrified; there\u2019s very little room for failures there these days. That raffish neighbourhood was at the tail-end of its existence in 1979, when Elaine Kraf\u2019s cult classic The Princess of 72nd Street first appeared.\n\nKraf was a writer and painter; the author of four published works of fiction, as well as much work that never made it into the public sphere, she died in 2013. The Princess of 72nd Street is narrated by Ellen, an artist gifted with episodes she calls \u201cradiances\u201d. \u201cI am glad I have the radiance,\u201d the novel begins.\n\nIt is these radiances that enable her to become Esmerelda, the Princess of 72nd Street, glorious in a long skirt, patterned with \u201ccascades of color\u201d, a great amulet hung from her neck \u2014 sometimes a cross, sometimes a Star of David, sometimes an Egyptian ankh \u2014 and her \u201cglittering eyes\u201d painted Cleopatra-style.\n\nEllen/Esmerelda fights to preserve her independence against the tides of control: the men who want to sleep with her, the doctors who want to medicate her. Her radiances are perhaps bipolar episodes, if we\u2019re going to try clinical language: but this slender novel immerses us in the brilliance of its world so we feel as far from madness as its protagonist does.\n\nComparisons have been made to the work of Jean Rhys; I thought too of Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar and Leonora Carrington\u2019s The Hearing Trumpet. In the Princess\u2019s consciousness, the ecosystem of the Upper West Side depends on her magnanimous rule: \u201cIf I should move away it would fall apart.\u201d She describes with loving care its tattered, accessible charm. \u201cTomatoes and radishes grow in boxes placed on dirty windowsills. A tan can be gotten free in Riverside Park, and there are always places open for late night wanderers.\u201d\n\nThe women in these books seem irrefutably modern: yet this is a modernity that New York has long offered, even in an unlikely way. For there sits Catherine Sloper, settled on \u201cthe chaste upholstery of a New York drawing-room\u201d in Henry James\u2019s brief, intimate novel Washington Square, first published in 1880. In those days, her widower father\u2019s grand mansion was \u201cup town\u201d, away from the hustle and bustle of lower Manhattan. The same year the book came out, construction began on an apartment building so far uptown it was seen to be in a veritable wilderness \u2014 and nicknamed the Dakota as a result.\n\nIn Washington Square poor Catherine is pitied by Dr Sloper, mired in grief after the loss of his wife; she appears at first to be the victim of her father\u2019s disregard and her aunt\u2019s romantic machinations. Catherine\u2019s Washington Square mansion might seem to be a prison; certainly, she is trapped by the morals and mores of her time. But the novel\u2019s end finds Catherine serene in her solitude, a mistress of the city in her own quiet way.\n\nNew York\u2019s constant reinvention should make it feel precarious; instead, it delivers a unique sense of permanence, allowing those who find a foothold \u2014 not least women on their own \u2014 to discover a sense of permission unavailable elsewhere. This beautiful, ridiculous city, indeed.\n\nEach of these books demonstrates that no matter the cost of living, no matter how broken the subway or how much garbage is piled in the street, New York still exerts its glorious pull \u2014 somehow makes room for those who would hear its siren jazz.

After her mother, the progressive Texas governor Ann Richards, was defeated in her 1994 bid for re-election by future president George W Bush, the younger Richards was troubled by what she had seen on the campaign trail.\n\nThe longtime community and union organiser, who has died aged 67, told The Dallas Morning News in 1996: \u201cThe whole tone and feeling about politics had changed, just in four years.\u201d She said: \u201cI was really concerned that people were feeling very hateful. They were on a mission to eradicate these \u2018godless, anti-family officials\u2019 they thought were ruining the country.\u201d\n\nAlarmed by the rising political influence of the religious right in Texas, Richards formed the advocacy organisation Texas Freedom Network. She told the paper that she realised that to do nothing would be worse than failure.\n\nThat would become a constant refrain throughout her life as she became one of the most recognisable progressive figures in America. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine future generations one day asking, \u2018When there was so much at stake for our country, what did you do?\u2019\u201d she often repeated. \u201cThe only acceptable answer is: \u2018Everything we could.\u2019\u201d\n\nBorn in Waco, Texas, in 1957, the eldest of four children, Richards grew up steeped in progressive values. Still, her parents, a teacher who later entered politics, and a civil rights lawyer, were surprised when aged 13 she was sent home from school for wearing a black armband to protest against the Vietnam war. In college she helped organise the school\u2019s janitorial staff and later worked with garment workers in Guatemala.\n\nRichards moved deeper into politics, campaigning for her mother while heavily pregnant with twins, and later gaining a reputation as a highly effective political operative when deputy chief of staff to Nancy Pelosi. She became a household name in the US for her work as the leader of Planned Parenthood, which provides affordable family planning and birth control, cancer screenings, STD testing and, in some clinics, abortion services. During 12 years at the helm she turned the healthcare provider into a political powerhouse. When she left in 2018, supporters and volunteers had more than tripled to 11mn people, and unintended pregnancies in the US hit a 30-year low.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, a flashpoint since its founding more than 100 years ago, has been increasingly embattled in recent decades. Richards\u2019 2006 appointment was a tacit acknowledgment that reproductive healthcare, bodily autonomy and abortion access in the US had entered a new era of politicisation. The organisation became a political firebrand for the conservative right, a proxy for women\u2019s bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom. \u201cThe goal here is they want to end access to safe and legal abortion in America,\u201d Richards told The New York Times in 2017, \u201cand the way they do that is by going after Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nRichards was beloved by progressives, a highly charismatic, energetic leader who never compromised her values for political expediency. She was also a firm believer in the power of personal narratives to destigmatise abortion. The mother of three was open about her own decision to undergo the procedure but often declined to elaborate further, emphasising the crucial difference between giving women the freedom to share their experience and forcing them to justify their decision.\n\nIn a 2022 article for The New York Times, Richards reflected on her leadership at the organisation. She regretted believing that providing quality healthcare and having the majority of America\u2019s support would be enough. \u201cI wasn\u2019t cynical enough to fully comprehend the extent of the Republican Party\u2019s willingness to trade away people\u2019s lives for political power,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Roe vs Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court in June 2022 and abortion access in much of the US crumbled overnight, Richards helped launch a chatbot to provide Americans with accurate, confidential information about accessing abortion care.\n\nShe continued to fight for progressive causes even after her diagnosis of brain cancer in 2023, knowing she had no time to waste. She drew on her mother\u2019s wisdom often during this time, she said. Although it was a mantra she had repeated innumerable times, Richards would phrase it as a question, as if she could have forgotten: \u201cWhat was Mom\u2019s line? Why should your life only be about you?\u201d", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ebe2b217-926d-420c-b171-9ceb93001683"}}, {"id": "f1080287-de6d-404c-bed5-ec246f4f5ee6", "event_name": "Who\u2019s afraid of Melania Trump?", "blurb": "Flotus 2.0 is ready to fly", "date": "2025-01-2500:00:00.0", "body": "Of all the people to have entered the White House this week, it is Melania who still remains the blankest of blank slates. The first lady is only the second to serve non-consecutive terms of office: the Trumps follow Grover and Frances Cleveland, who served from 1885-89 and then again from 1893-97. But during her first time in office Melania barely registered in public, preferring to keep out of the spotlight while she raised Barron, the couple\u2019s son who was 10 at the time of the inauguration. She made almost no speeches, and started few initiatives: her Be Best platform, to raise the issues of child welfare, promote \u201ckindness\u201d and crack down on online bullying, fairly failed to launch.\n\nStill now, eight years on, she remains an enigmatic presence. The scant clues that have offered access to her inner thinking have been based on wardrobe semaphores and gestures as we attempt to understand the woman behind the sphinx-like gaze. In particular, the Trump marriage has been a constant source of speculation: is it real, an arrangement or a sham? When Melania finally conceded to move into the White House in June 2017, the couple reportedly became the first since Richard and Pat Nixon to take up separate rooms.\n\nOften, one gets the impression that Melania can\u2019t stand her husband, or can hardly tolerate his company. She wears an expression of barely concealed impatience when watching her spouse doing his peculiar \u201cYMCA\u201d boogies and recoils from the simplest physical advance.\n\nHer cool aversion was noted once again, in front of billions, during this week\u2019s inauguration when his attempts to plant a kiss on Melania\u2019s cheek were thwarted by a piece of millinery sporting an outsize and spouse-repelling brim. Potus was left puckered, flailing and humiliated; Melania sat stock-still. Any emotion in her face was also screened as most of it remained in the hat\u2019s shade.\n\nFor Trump, who likes to burnish his strongman image with a veneer of inviolable masculinity and power, Melania makes an extraordinary foil. While the Potus surrounds himself with yes men and supplicants, his own wife makes no secret of the fact that she often disagrees with Donald, and that her \u201cfirst priority\u2009is to be a mom\u201d.\n\nRare is the person in Trump\u2019s orbit who describes him as being less than a first concern. But could the testy nature of the Trump union help temper his more alarming Maga views? Maybe for all her husband\u2019s hubris, Melania holds more power than we realise. Just as Trump has \u201cemployed\u201d Barron as an unofficial adviser on youth-think, he seeks his wife\u2019s counsel, too. In his post-inauguration speech, made to supporters on Monday, Trump credited Melania with convincing him to tone down the list of grievances he had planned to air. In particular, she had \u201cbegged\u201d him not to raise the subject of the \u201cJ6\u201d insurrectionists who led the Capitol Hill riots, which he managed to stay mute on, at least until he left the stage.\n\nDuring her conversation with Fox & Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt last week, Melania spoke about their marriage, and how she sometimes holds a contrary point of view. The most significant point of difference, as revealed in her memoir, is that she supports abortion and a woman\u2019s right to choose. \u201cI\u2019m standing on my own two feet, independent. I have my own thoughts,\u201d said Flotus in the rare interview. \u201cI don\u2019t always agree [with] what my husband is saying or doing\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I give him my advice and sometimes he listens.\u201d For his part, Trump seems almost conciliatory and gentle when talking of his wife: when asked of her views on abortion, he told Fox News, that he had told her to \u201cstick with your heart\u201d and \u201cwrite what you believe\u201d.\n\nCompared to the gusty exposition of her husband, Melania\u2019s crisp exclamations seem almost erudite. And they indicate that behind the carapace of blankness there stirs a woman preparing to enter a new phase. Melania 2.0 has arrived in Washington in a different guise \u2014 and I don\u2019t just mean The Hamburglar suit. She is making a documentary about the transition, she is releasing crypto, having shepherded her son and first priority through adolescence to university she has given him the wings with which \u201cto fly\u201d. (Good luck with that lift-off, incidentally; Barron is staggeringly tall.)\n\nBut, like her husband, she is nursing grudges against those who treated her poorly last time around. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t accept me,\u201d she said of her first time in office, \u201cthey didn\u2019t understand me the way maybe they do now.\u201d This time, she continued. \u201cI know where I will be going, I know the rooms.\u201d\n\nSuch statements show signs of more ambition. She may only have been talking about how she prefers the decorative scheme. But if there is a microgram of hope for this new world order, one wonders if Melania will use her new resolve to try to use her influence for good. Imagine if she could actually get her Be Best platform off the ground. Last time she tried to engage the leaders of the \u201cstreaming platforms\u201d with her concerns over online safety she \u201cdidn\u2019t have much support\u201d. Perhaps now those same folk are quaffing Maga Kool-Aid and Nazi-saluting their supporters (we see you, Elon), she might have a better chance.\n\nOr perhaps she will simply elide any further public-facing duty and make house a second time in her new first home. That\u2019s the riddle of Melania, it\u2019s impossible to know.\n\njo.ellison@ft.com\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/dac5e30c-1043-4f88-9c66-8a59ecbd9b74"}}, {"id": "89e2870a-f8c7-49e7-a235-98571cd63977", "event_name": "Supercomputers: the new superpower status symbol", "blurb": "US president\u2019s endorsement shows data-centre dominion is now a national priority", "date": "2025-01-2500:00:00.0", "body": "Almost a hundred years ago, New York\u2019s skyline became the scene of a bitter battle. The prize: displacing the Woolworth Building as the world\u2019s tallest property. Such superlatives mattered to a growing, industrialised nation keen to flex its dominance. The winner was 40 Wall Street, swiftly pipped by the Chrysler Building, which in turn lost the title to the Empire State Building.\n\nToday, there is a new superpower status symbol: data centres. The latest bid for digital supremacy is Stargate. This mammoth project led by artificial intelligence company OpenAI, and announced by US President Donald Trump, pledges to spend up to $500bn over four years to construct world-changing AI infrastructure \u2014 basically warehouses filled with clusters of microchips \u2014 on an unprecedented scale.\n\nTrump\u2019s endorsement, with a reassurance that no government money is involved, shows data-centre dominion is now a national priority. That is no surprise. New regimes love big gestures. Think of the \u201c10 great buildings\u201d with which Chairman Mao peppered Beijing in 1959, or The Line, a 106-mile sliver of a city under construction at the behest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin-Salman.\n\nStargate is a trophy too. But it is also an arms race, because OpenAI is in effect building a weapon. Co-founder Sam Altman\u2019s goal is to achieve \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d, the kind that outflanks human beings. That this is now a White House-backed initiative reflects a superpower reality: whichever country reaches AGI first poses a significant threat, commercially and militarily, to the rest.\n\nWhat does $500bn buy? First, assume the money can actually be raised; departed OpenAI co-founder and Tesla head Elon Musk is sceptical. The latest Blackwell chips from Nvidia could cost about $50,000 apiece, suggesting Altman\u2019s budget could cover 10mn of them. The biggest AI supercomputer in the world today, Musk\u2019s Colossus, has about 100,000. Size alone does not guarantee AGI success, but it is an important factor.\n\nAt its most mundane, OpenAI is following other big technology firms. So-called hyperscalers Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet are collectively on course to invest $260bn in capital expenditure next year, according to Visible Alpha. Stargate\u2019s plan of an average $125bn a year is big, but not substantially greater than theirs.\n\nBut Altman\u2019s scheme is undeniably different. Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are building computing power customers can use, with a path to sizeable near-term revenue. OpenAI\u2019s foray is more of a moonshot. Succeed, and vast profit awaits. Fail, and a surfeit of servers could push down prices and profit for the whole industry.\n\nIn the real world, meanwhile, traditional projections of power remain in fashion. China is planning 118 skyscrapers higher than London\u2019s Shard, to add to the 100 or so it already has, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. Saudi Arabia, keen to be an AI hub, is also eyeing what will be the world\u2019s tallest building, the Jeddah Tower. It\u2019s just that in the AI age, there are more ways to reach for the heavens.\n\njohn.foley@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/651339b1-bb08-4710-8fe5-7a68452ee3b1"}}, {"id": "c3252349-2f57-4132-ba7e-c6f03d7b3105", "event_name": "Donald Trump\u2019s exit from Paris climate accord has \u2018huge impact\u2019, says Brazil\u2019s COP30 chief", "blurb": "US withdrawal will make it \u2018much harder\u2019 to curb global warming, says Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago", "date": "2025-01-2500:00:00.0", "body": "The US withdrawal from the Paris climate accord for a second time under President Donald Trump will have a \u201chuge impact\u201d on efforts to curb global warming, the incoming head of the UN COP30 climate summit has warned.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, the experienced Brazilian diplomat and climate negotiator appointed this week, told the Financial Times that the exit of the US could also allow nations such as China, India and Brazil to take a bigger role in the world\u2019s most important climate talks.\n\nTrump fulfilled a pledge on his first day in office to once again pull the US out of what he described as an \u201cunfair, one-sided Paris climate accord rip-off\u201d. The US was the first country to withdraw during his first term as president in 2017, a move reversed by President Joe Biden in 2021.\n\nMany scientists already say the world is way off track to meet the Paris accord goals of limiting the global average temperature rise to well below 2C and preferably no more than 1.5C from pre-industrial times. The UN has predicted that the temperature rise will reach 2.9C this century.\n\nCorr\u00eaa do Lago said the US pivot \u201cis going to make it much more difficult\u201d to limit global warming and would \u201chave an immense impact on efforts to keep temperature rises below 1.5C\u201d. Developing nations could step up to fill the gap, however.\n\n\u201cThe countries of the global south have made immense efforts in their own nations to contain climate change,\u201d Corr\u00eaa do Lago said. \u201cTake the case of China. China is constantly bringing forward its objectives, for example, this year it will sell more electric cars than internal combustion ones.\u201d\n\nThe FT reported this week that Argentina\u2019s libertarian President Javier Milei, among the few world leaders invited to Trump\u2019s inauguration, was also weighing an exit from the Paris Agreement.\n\nCorr\u00eaa do Lago said Argentina, while free to make its own decisions, could jeopardise its participation in the newly agreed trade deal between the EU and the Mercosur bloc of South American nations.\n\n\u201cYou have to remember that to be able to benefit from the EU-Mercosur agreement, you have to be a member of the Paris Agreement\u201d.\n\nThe 65-year-old veteran diplomat, who has served as ambassador to Japan and India as well as Brazil\u2019s lead climate negotiator, also faces the task of finding ways to plug a trillion-dollar gap in climate change funding ahead of the COP30 to be held in the Amazon port of Bel\u00e9m in November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that we think far outside traditional thinking on climate finance,\u201d he said, citing reports by former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers and Indian economist NK Singh on the role of multilateral banks and by a G20 group of experts on \u201cgreen growth\u201d. \u201cWe have to make mainstream investment favour climate [finance].\u201d\n\nBrazil has one of the world\u2019s greenest electricity grids, thanks to abundant hydropower, and has reduced Amazon deforestation sharply under the government of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\n\nBut agriculture remains a large source of its emissions, as the country is one of the world\u2019s biggest beef and soy producers.\n\nEnvironmentalists have also criticised Brazil for boosting oil production, with the aim of becoming a top global exporter by the end of the decade.\n\nCorr\u00eaa do Lago said Lula had been clear about the need for a \u201cfair transition\u201d away from fossil fuels that would not increase poverty or hurt living standards in a nation where many still live below the breadline.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we can do in the preparation for COP30 is to restore confidence that climate change can be fought in a rational way.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Attracta Mooney in London", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3a2b087d-0e54-414b-aa3a-0f23b15eeabe"}}, {"id": "5b06e3a7-a054-4829-99e8-a7db4264ace4", "event_name": "Private chef\u2019s notebook: how to dodge the chaos of client kitchens", "blurb": "Sometimes the key to client-chef tranquility is to barely set foot in their home", "date": "2025-01-2500:00:00.0", "body": "When scrolling social media, I often land in the world of private-chef-tok: TikTok accounts run by people who do the same job I do of cooking in homes. This genre is immensely popular, in part for how visually pleasing these videos can be: luxurious kitchens, pristine counters, a pace of work that is somehow both zippy and unhurried.\n\nBut cooking from a client\u2019s home rarely looks like it does on social media. A kitchen is the heart of the home, the backdrop of groggy mornings, standing-up snacks and behind-the-scenes moments. I live and work in New York City, where the home is often the only oasis in the surrounding chaos. It didn\u2019t take me long to learn that when I enter a client\u2019s space as a person who is there to do a job, some of that tranquility gets unsettled.\n\nOften, clients don\u2019t totally know how to act. Should they talk to me? Can they speak frankly with one another while I\u2019m there? Sometimes clients fire off mid-recipe requests (I won\u2019t forget the diabetic who kept requesting bacon as I cooked him oatmeal). And I, of course, carry a low-level hum of anxiety with me. What if I break the heirloom knife? What if I spill flour all over myself? Am I meant to be keeping an eye on that toddler? I don\u2019t blame my clients for one second. Why shouldn\u2019t they move through their home freely?\n\nAll this has led me to an unconventional place: I am a private chef who prefers not to cook in my client\u2019s homes. I know how that sounds. One would assume that part of the job is producing food quickly and at close quarters, but I interpret good personal cheffing as something intimate, as opposed to immediate.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019ll never say a hard no to cooking in someone\u2019s home, but my preferred set-up holds surprising value for both of us. First, it removes the unnecessary hours of hauling around ingredients, knife kits etc that come with performing one\u2019s work in another person\u2019s space. Second, clients don\u2019t have to see the less glamorous elements of how the sausage is made \u2014 me scaling fish or peeling garlic or pounding cutlets. People who have hired a chef are often looking for some extra support, and doing these tasks away from their intimate space allows for it to stay uncomplicated and uncompromised. In my own space, I work quietly and quickly. The food is my only focus. My attention can go towards making the best experience for the client, as opposed to worrying about how the process looks.\n\nThe choice is also practical (and a bit bittersweet). Private cheffing relies on a strange relationship, one built on care but, ultimately, transactional. When budgets tighten, the chef is often the first cut. Cooking off-site keeps it sustainable for both sides. The idea of cooking in a separate space, then, isn\u2019t an avoidance of the intimacy that comes from the work; it\u2019s in fact in the interest of protecting it.\n\nI know personal chefs who have no problem showing up in someone\u2019s home, cooking and leaving. For them, work stays in the kitchen, whereas I seem to carry it with me.\n\nIn many ways, this is why aspirational private-chef-tok is so attractive to consume. No mess, no heavy loading of ingredients in and out of space, and \u2014 crucially \u2014 no clients! Just someone cooking on camera, in good light, for someone invisible.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend Magazine on X and FT Weekend on Instagram", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b076b820-9201-428d-a2fc-2c641876d57d"}}, {"id": "fe584623-fada-466b-8a0a-e7a4351b0f7e", "event_name": "Swamp Notes: Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018vendetta agenda\u2019", "blurb": "Trump promised \u2018retribution\u2019 during his election campaign.

The incoming defence secretary also failed to demonstrate he can manage the Pentagon effectively.\n\nOn Thursday, Murkowski said she could not vote for him \u201cin good conscience\u201d, while Collins said she was \u201cnot convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed\u201d.\n\nAhead of the vote, Trump told reporters on Friday that he \u201cwas very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that\u201d, adding that \u201cPete\u2019s a very, very good man\u201d.\n\nHe also anticipated that McConnell would be a hold out too: \u201cOf course, Mitch is always a \u2018no\u2019 vote, I guess.\u201d\n\nTrump shocked Washington and defence circles when he selected Hegseth, who served in the Army National Guard, for the role. He has since been dogged by allegations of sexual assault, alcohol abuse, misogyny, sexism and racism.\n\nHegseth said in written answers to questions that he paid $50,000 to the woman who accused him of sexual assault in a California hotel room in 2017, according to Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nHegseth dismissed the allegations about the sexual assault, his character and preparedness for the top Pentagon job as \u201ca smear campaign\u201d at his Senate confirmation hearing last week. He also tried to revise his previous statements about women soldiers, saying they would \u201chave access to ground combat roles, given the standards remain high\u201d.\n\nOn air Hegseth became known for denouncing diversity, equity and inclusive initiatives. DEI policies in the military were \u201cdividing troops\u201d and forcing \u201ccommanders to walk on eggshells\u201d, Hegseth said at his hearing.\n\nMore Senate confirmation fireworks could come when two other contentious cabinet nominees, Robert F Kennedy Jr and Tulsi Gabbard, are grilled by senators on January 29 and January 30, respectively.

In it the president bashed the \u201cforeign aid industry and bureaucracy\u201d as \u201cnot aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values\u201d, and asked for assistance to be suspended.\n\nIn the first days of his second term in the White House, Trump has taken aggressive steps to reshape and redirect all agencies of the US government to implement his policies.\n\nScientific agencies such as the National Institutes of Health have also paused grant work pending review by the new administration, alarming researchers.\n\nThere are some exceptions to Rubio\u2019s aid freeze order, among them \u201capproved waivers\u201d for military financing for Israel and Egypt, as well as foreign emergency food aid.

One attendee joked about fetching some popcorn for the show.\n\nTrump did not hold back, provoking nervous laughter as he issued a series of demands and ultimatums to allies and rivals alike.\n\nSaudi Arabia and other producers must cut oil prices, global central banks \u201cimmediately\u201d needed to slash interest rates, and foreign companies must ramp up investments in US factories or face tariffs. The EU \u2014 which came in for particular opprobrium \u2014 must stop hitting big American technology companies with competition fines.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be demanding respect from other nations,\u201d the president said. His predecessor had \u201callowed other nations to take advantage of the US. We can\u2019t allow that to happen any more.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s demands came amid a frenetic first week in office in which the president launched a blitzkrieg of executive orders and announcements intended not just to reshape the state but also assert America\u2019s economic and commercial supremacy. Tariffs of up to 25 per cent could be slapped on Canada and Mexico as early as February 1, riding roughshod over the trade deal Trump himself negotiated in his first term.\n\nChina could face levies of up to 100 per cent if Beijing failed to agree on a deal to sell at least 50 per cent of the TikTok app to a US company, while the EU was told to purchase more American oil if it wanted to avoid tariffs. Underscoring the new American unilateralism, Trump pulled the US out of the World Health Organization, as well as exiting the Paris climate accord for a second time.\n\nStrikingly, Trump reached for an obscure, 90-year-old provision in the US tax code to threaten a doubling of tax rates for foreign nationals and companies if their home countries were deemed to have imposed \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d taxes on American multinationals.\n\nThis proposal throws a \u201chand grenade\u201d at international tax policymaking, says Niels Johannesen, director of the Oxford university Centre for Business Taxation at Sa\u00efd Business School. The move suggests a determination to \u201cshape other countries\u2019 tax policy through coercion rather than through co-operation\u201d, he adds.\n\nThe plans unveiled this week by the new president raise the spectre of a multi-front economic war as Trump uses the power of America\u2019s resurgent economy to rebalance the international order in his favour.\n\nThe key question, say investors and policymakers, is whether this amounts to a more intense version of the transactional, dealmaking approach seen in Trump\u2019s first term, or a shift towards unbridled unilateralism, where a White House unbound by the constraints of international law cajoles and intimidates foreign governments and businesses.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s weaponising everything: trade, tax and energy. I\u2019m worried that finance will get weaponised too,\u201d says the head of one of the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth funds. \u201cMost people are betting that he cares about the stock market \u2014 that\u2019s the only check. That and the fact that he has said he wants to be a peacemaker.\u201d\n\nIn Davos, leading US executives were eager to cheer Trump\u2019s agenda \u2014 suggesting there is little anxiety within the corporate sector about the US potentially rupturing the global rules-based order.\n\nTariffs are an \u201ceconomic tool. That\u2019s it,\u201d said Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, in a CNBC interview at Davos this week. \u201cIf it\u2019s a little inflationary, but it\u2019s good for national security, so be it. Get over it.\u201d\n\nThe US stock market rallied this week as investors digested the prospect of an easing of regulations governing banks and high-technology companies, as well as the announcement of a massive $100bn artificial intelligence infrastructure project launched by OpenAI and SoftBank.\u00a0By the end of the week (as of late Friday afternoon in New York), the S&P 500 index was up 1.8 per cent.\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, people talk to CEOs and say they all feel super-positive,\u201d says Mahmood Pradhan, head of global macro at Amundi Investment Institute.\n\n\u201cIf I ask myself what justifies the animal spirits, the banking deregulation stuff is real and the prospect of lower corporate taxes is real.\u201d\n\nYet, outside the US, the threat of a widening array of trade barriers and conflicts over tax policies is weighing on the economic outlook. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU\u2019s economics commissioner, says a fracturing of global trade would be of particular worry to economies like Europe, where trade accounts for more than a fifth of GDP.\n\nHe cites IMF estimates showing that extreme geoeconomic fragmentation in trade could wipe out 7 per cent of global GDP over the medium run.\u00a0\u201cIf this global economic fragmentation settles in \u2014 and there is\u00a0a risk of that \u2014 it is going to have sizeable negative economic consequences.\u201d\n\nEven while bracing for a tariff onslaught, though, some European policymakers claim to see potential upsides.\n\n\u201cIt is a new environment which is definitely less comfortable for Europe, but which also offers a lot of opportunities,\u201d says Alexander de Croo, Belgium\u2019s prime minister. \u201cEurope can show there that we have stability and that you are in a predictable environment where investment can take place.\u201d\n\nEuropean officials also say they could benefit from deeper trade ties with other countries that may be squeezed out of US markets. \u201cCountries are coming to us because they want to diversify away from the US,\u201d says a senior EU official.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep on being open but not being naive,\u201d says Spanish economy minister Carlos Cuerpo. \u201cWe need to have our companies competing under equal footing, equal conditions and a level playing field with respect to others. That was the case with China. That will need to be the case also with the US.\u201d\n\nWhile the US and Europe have long railed against Chinese trade practices, Beijing was quick this week to present itself as an upholder of the global, rules-based order rather than its nemesis.\n\nSpeaking the day after Trump was inaugurated, Chinese vice-premier Ding Xuexiang insisted that economic globalisation \u201cis not a \u2018you lose, I win\u2019, zero-sum game\u201d. The largest countries of the world needed to \u201clead by example\u201d he said, praising international bodies including the World Trade Organization and UN.\n\nThe irony of China presenting itself as a free-trading paragon while Trump seeks to extract concessions from his closest allies by brute economic force was not lost on Davos attendees watching Ding\u2019s performance.\n\nDespite the barrage of measures and statements fired out by the White House this week, most global policymakers are taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump\u2019s aggressive transactionalism, rather than leaping to conclusions about the longer-term ramifications for the global economic system.\n\n\u201cWhy put my cards on the table before he has?\u201d says the senior EU official.\n\nJonathan Reynolds, the UK\u2019s business secretary, acknowledges there remain \u201clots of questions\u201d about the president\u2019s approach. \u201cIs it about leverage around negotiations? Is it about revenue-raising in terms of tariffs?\u201d The UK, he says, will continue to argue for a \u201cmuch more open, global trading economy.\u201d\n\nThere is little question, however, that Trump is signalling a significant escalation in how he will wield trade as a weapon compared with his first term.\n\n\u201cThose around Trump have had time to build up a systematic, methodological approach for protectionist trade policy and it shows,\u201d says former UK trade department official Allie Renison, now at consultancy SEC Newgate. The approach will be to build up a case file of \u201cevidence\u201d against countries, she says, and then use it to extract concessions in areas of both economic and foreign policy.\n\nThe question remains how far Trump is willing to go. The danger of trampling on the rules-based order, says Jeromin Zettelmeyer, head of the Bruegel think-tank, is a complete breakdown in the diplomatic and legal channels for settling international disputes.\n\nIf Trump were to pull out of a wider range of international frameworks, such as the WTO or the IMF, he warns, then the arrangements that help govern the global economy could get \u201csubstantively destroyed\u201d.\n\nThe extreme case, he adds, is that \u201cthey really do a Putin\u201d \u2014 namely by violating the sanctity of international borders. Taking control of Greenland or the Panama Canal by force, as Trump has threatened, would amount to \u201cthe reintroduction of the law of the jungle\u201d.\n\nMichael Strain, director of Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute think-tank, questions whether Trump will reverse the \u201cfundamental forces\u201d that drive global economic integration \u2014 and whether the president even wants to do so. But regardless, he says, the uncertainty about his true intentions \u201cmakes it hard for business to plan, creates a chilling effect on investment, and creates tensions with our allies.\u201d\n\nSome caution against being awestruck by Trump\u2019s threats or his espousal of capitalism without limits, because his agenda was so incoherent.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is huge doses of American hubris,\u201d says Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez, dean of the Paris School of International Affairs at Sciences Po. \u201cWe are blinded by the intensity of all the issues put on the table and by Trump\u2019s conviction. But we are not looking at the contradictions.

Another quarter-point cut is expected in June or July.\n\nDespite the president\u2019s efforts to steer monetary policy lower, some investors believe the central bank will have limited room to cut further, with the dollar expected to continue its rally of recent months.\n\nDan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at $2tn asset manager Pimco, told the Financial Times this week that the Fed was poised to keep rates on hold \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d and could even increase borrowing costs.\n\nAsian currencies, including the Japanese yen and Indian rupee, strengthened against the dollar following Trump\u2019s comments.

Public consultations began this week in Washington and the president has asked the US trade representative to make recommendations on the pact\u2019s future by April 1.\n\nOttawa and Mexico City are bracing for Trump to push for a renegotiation of USMCA \u2014 which the president renegotiated during his first term in what he called a \u201ccolossal victory for American workers\u201d \u2014 rather than the loosely defined but narrower \u201creview\u201d scheduled under the pact.\n\n\u201cIt is his to play with, it is his to refashion,\u201d said Andrew Shoyer, a former USTR official and now trade lawyer at Sidley Austin.\n\nPeople familiar with the White House\u2019s plans say the US wants to make changes to limit foreign content in cars and to curtail growing Chinese links to Mexico\u2019s economy.\n\nTrump has also raised the US\u2019s high trade deficits with the two USMCA partners, warning Ottawa that Washington could use \u201ceconomic force\u201d to make Canada the country\u2019s 51st state.\n\nCanada \u201ccan always become a state, and if you\u2019re a state, we won\u2019t have a deficit\u201d, he told the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need their lumber, because we have our own forests.

Another said: \u201cThe Danes are utterly freaked out by this.\u201d\n\nA former Danish official added: \u201cIt was a very tough conversation. He threatened specific measures against Denmark such as targeted tariffs.\u201d\n\nThe Danish prime minister\u2019s office said it did \u201cnot recognise the interpretation of the conversation given by anonymous sources\u201d.\n\nGreenland, home to just 57,000 people, is an entry point to new shipping routes gradually opening up through the Arctic; it also boasts abundant but hard to access minerals.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has been clear that the safety and security of Greenland is important to the United States as China and Russia make significant investments throughout the Arctic region,\u201d a White House National Security Council spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThe President is committed to not only protecting US interests in the Arctic but also working with Greenland to ensure mutual prosperity for both nations.\u201d\n\nTrump threatened in early January to impose duties on Denmark if it opposed him on Greenland. He also declined to rule out using military force to take control of the island.\n\n\u201cPeople really don\u2019t even know if Denmark has any legal right to it but, if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security,\u201d Trump said at a press conference days before taking office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about protecting the free world,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We\u2019re not letting that happen.\u201d\n\nM\u00fate Egede, Greenland\u2019s prime minister, has repeatedly stressed that the island\u2019s inhabitants want independence rather than US \u2014 or Danish \u2014 citizenship. But he has welcomed US business interest in mining and tourism.\n\nFrederiksen held a meeting with chief executives of large Danish companies including Novo Nordisk and Carlsberg last week to discuss Trump\u2019s threats, including potential tariffs against her country.\n\nOn the day of the Trump call, she told Denmark\u2019s TV2: \u201cThere is no doubt that there is great interest in and around Greenland. Based on the conversation I had today, there is no reason to believe that it should be less than what we have heard in the public debate.\u201d", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ace02a6f-3307-43f8-aac3-16b6646b60f6"}}, {"id": "0d4cec62-0f02-449c-9a37-dd91e0896fa7", "event_name": "Animal spirits in markets risk running too far", "blurb": "Giddy investors have pushed up stocks in one of the stronger opening months to any year in the past decade", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "Now would be a good time for investors to curb their enthusiasm, just a little. This year has begun with the bulls largely in control. Already, US stocks have risen about 4 per cent, making this one of the stronger opening months to any year in the past decade.\n\nThe re-inauguration of Donald Trump as US president has ushered in a new period of \u201canimal spirits\u201d among business executives, as veteran investor Stan Druckenmiller put it this week. Chief executives are \u201csomewhere between relieved and giddy\u201d at the election result, he told CNBC. Meanwhile, US banks are in \u201cgo-mode\u201d, a senior JPMorgan executive told the Davos crowd, while crypto is on the cusp of entering the \u201cbanana zone\u201d, according to its boosters. (Nope, me neither. Apparently that\u2019s good, though, indicating prices are about to surge.)\n\nHSBC is sticking with the good vibes. Its multi-asset team this week outlined an \u201cextremely positive\u201d backdrop for risky assets in the first half of this year \u2014 a scenario it described as \u201cGoldilocks on steroids\u201d, quite the mental image.\n\nAt the risk of spoiling all the fun, some market watchers \u2014 including some of the optimists \u2014 are getting a little nervous. The first big reason is the global government bond market, which has got off to a wobbly start to the year. This is not entirely a bad thing \u2014 it reflects a continuation of the US economic growth miracle. But it also reflects an expectation that inflation will continue to stick around and that the Federal Reserve will therefore struggle to keep reducing interest rates \u2014 no matter how much Trump would like it to. On the margins, it also suggests asset managers demand a somewhat higher rate of return for feeding government coffers.\n\nWhatever your preferred narrative here, the point is that bond investors have been wrongfooted (again) and that the resulting drop in prices has pushed yields up (again). The most important benchmark of them all \u2014 the US 10-year yield \u2014 is sitting well above 4.5 per cent. That marks a recovery in prices since mid-January but is still high enough to undermine the case for loading up on stocks.\n\nAs my colleagues reported this week, US stocks have now reached their most expensive point relative to bonds in a generation. It is becoming ever harder to justify venturing further into stocks when their expected profits compared with earnings have sunk so far below the risk-free rate.\n\nPeter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, noted at an event at the bank\u2019s swanky London office this week that stocks had largely shrugged off this competition from bonds so far \u2014 in large part because optimism around growth is so strong. But that leaves equities now \u201cvulnerable to further rises in yields\u201d.\n\nIt is mildly silly but nonetheless true that much here depends on round numbers, which act as useful psychological signposts to investors. The big test would be if US yields hit 5 per cent. At that point, one of two things would happen: the bond haters would capitulate and snap up some bargains to pull the yield back down again, or selling would intensify and every asset class would feel the pain. My strong hunch is the former.\n\nWe are not at that point yet, but as Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, put it this week, \u201cwe\u2019re still at a critical level\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really getting close to the zip code where slightly slower growth and slightly higher rates become a deadly combination for the markets,\u201d she said. As a result, she is sceptical that equities in general, and highly concentrated, highly tech-dependent US stock markets in particular, can continue the spectacular run of the past two years. Shalett is anticipating gains in US stocks of between 5 and 10 per cent this year. That is not bad, by any stretch, but it would not be a repeat of the 20 per cent-plus performance in each of the past two years.\n\nAnother factor tapping on the alarm bells is the level of optimism itself, especially among retail investors. The American Association of Individual Investors reported that sentiment had \u201cskyrocketed\u201d in its latest monthly survey. Expectations that stock prices will rise over the next six months jumped by some 18 percentage points to January, the AAII said.\n\nEven optimistic wealth managers, who advise a lot of these investors, are having a hard time holding them back. Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist for Baird Private Wealth Management, told me this week that he believes in the bull market, albeit with half an eye on bond yields, which have moved \u201cup and to the right with no obvious reason\u201d. But he sees anecdotal signs that the American exceptionalism theme is becoming overly entrenched among his clients. \u201cI\u2019m starting to get questions about whether you need to diversify at all,\u201d he said.\n\nNone of this is a reason to run to the hills and shelter in the safest assets you can find. But the air is getting somewhat thin at these heights and the potential for slip-ups from the new US presidential administration is strong. Glassy-eyed optimism rarely ends well, no matter how muscly Goldilocks becomes.\n\nkatie.martin@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4d3eed1b-22aa-437f-8337-460f00e35363"}}, {"id": "9a6022cf-318d-47a2-b5d7-02009cbfcc1d", "event_name": "US securities regulator opens door for Wall Street banks to hold crypto", "blurb": "Securities and Exchange Commission overturns guidance that made it costly to hold digital assets for clients", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "Wall Street\u2019s securities watchdog has made it easier for banks to expand their cryptocurrency businesses by overturning a Joe Biden administration rule that made it prohibitively expensive to hold digital assets.\n\nIn one of the first pro-crypto moves of Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency, the Securities and Exchange Commission late on Thursday reversed guidance known as SAB 121, which had called for institutions to treat digital tokens held for customers as liabilities on balance sheets.\n\nThe shift underscores expectations that Trump will take a far more welcoming approach towards the digital asset sector, undoing the more sceptical stance the SEC took during Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nMainstream groups are taking more serious interest in crypto assets and technologies, with BlackRock chief Larry Fink this week calling on the SEC to \u201crapidly approve\u201d the ability of companies to create tokens backed by stocks and bonds.\n\nIn a sign of Trump\u2019s more supportive crypto strategy, the president on Thursday had also issued an executive order laying out his priorities regarding cryptocurrencies and calling for cabinet-level officials to report back several months from now with recommendations for regulatory and legislative proposals.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s pick to lead the SEC, Paul Atkins, is still awaiting US Senate confirmation, acting chair Mark Uyeda and another Republican commissioner, Hester Peirce, have put the regulator on a more crypto-friendly track, forming a task force and dismantling SAB 121.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s SAB 121 had \u201ccreated a punitive framework that effectively prevented US banks from offering custody services for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\u201d, said Mark Palmer, an equity research analyst at The Benchmark Company. \u201cTraditional banks will now be able to offer crypto custody services without facing de facto penalties.\u201d\n\nEven before the SEC took action, big US banks were eagerly anticipating the ability to court crypto customers as Trump and his allies in the executive and legislative branches smoothed the road for digital assets.\n\n\u201cWe do want to have the ability to offer spot crypto, and our expectation is that at some point, the regulations around crypto are going to allow us to do that,\u201d Rick Wurster, chief executive at Charles Schwab, told analysts on a call this week.\n\nThe American Bankers Association and other industry lobbyists last year called on Biden to formally disapprove of the SEC guidance after measures to do so passed both houses of Congress in May 2024.\n\n\u201cThis is a step in the right direction,\u201d said Kevin Fromer, president of the Financial Services Forum, which represents the biggest banks.\n\nBrian Daly, a lawyer at Akin Gump, noted custody services were \u201ca predicate to everything\u201d for financial institutions when offering crypto services to customers.

The world has had at least a year to brace itself for the return of the America First agenda to the White House. No one can say they are surprised by this approach, or by most of Trump\u2019s initiatives \u2014 radical and divisive as some of them are. Even so, his full-throated unleashing of the animal spirits of American capitalism has unnerved some traditional allies. Now the world has to decide how to respond to the whirlwind that seems set to accompany, if not encapsulate, Trump\u2019s second administration.\n\nAmerica, too, has a big question to answer. Much of the focus in the opening days of Trump\u2019s new presidency has been on issues that secured his re-election, in particular reducing immigration and cutting back what his supporters call the \u201cdeep state\u201d, otherwise known as the federal government. He is right to attend to the concerns of the voters who sent him back to the Oval Office. But how should Americans respond if, as his opponents fear, he indulges his baser instincts and starts undermining the pillars of its democracy?\n\nThere is a simple answer to both questions: values in addition to interests. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord cannot, for example, become an excuse for the EU to slow its decarbonisation agenda; it should, though, ease the regulatory burdens and simplify its rules.\n\nOn the domestic front, too, now is the time to pick the right fights. US courts should be prepared for a battle royal over Trump\u2019s more controversial initiatives, such as his bid to end birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the 14th amendment of the constitution.\n\nTrump\u2019s opening foray has underlined a widespread sense that an era has ended. It has met a wearied response from America\u2019s allies, who see it as intensifying the threats to the multilateral order. But it is important to note that many elsewhere in the world view Trump more favourably and like the idea of a more inward-looking America. It is possible, too, that some of his initiatives may have desirable outcomes. It will take more than Trump\u2019s threat of tougher sanctions on Russia to bring Vladimir Putin to the table to negotiate a fair peace deal in Ukraine. But the president\u2019s blunt \u2014 and unexpected \u2014 warning this week was a step in the right direction, as well as a reminder of how he sees unpredictability as an asset.\n\nMore broadly, allies have to accept that some of Trump\u2019s prescriptions may prove a much-needed call to action. Just as in his last term he prodded Nato\u2019s members to spend more on defence, this time his backing for less regulation and bureaucracy and lower taxes will force EU leaders to confront with greater urgency the continent\u2019s problem of competitiveness.\n\nThese are early days. The fact that Trump has not started a new trade war with China or Europe does not mean one will not be under way next week. Whatever unfolds, it is a time for cool heads. Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, told the Financial Times this week that he and other east Asian leaders thought that, after an initial period of turmoil, the global trading system would survive intact. We have to hope he is right.\n\nTrump is now at the height of his powers, controlling both houses of Congress, with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court and with the following wind of re-election. At home and abroad, it is vital not to be distracted by the more performative elements of his agenda, to accept that sometimes he may be right, but most of all to stand up for what matters.

Instead it was a policy wonk, Stephen Miller, the architect of Donald Trump\u2019s second-term policy agenda and anti-immigration ideologue.\n\n\u201cThey were so sure they were going to crush this movement out of existence,\u201d bellowed Miller as his fiery eight-minute address reached a peak. \u201cAnd yet here we stand today and Maga is stronger, more powerful, more united and more determined than ever before.\u201d\u00a0The crowd went wild.\n\nSince returning to the Oval Office, Trump has wasted no time in signing a blizzard of executive orders aimed at boosting oil production, curbing immigration, scrapping diversity initiatives and pardoning January 6 rioters, to name just a few. As the president put his name to the directives, Miller, the mastermind behind them, was standing just metres away.\n\n\u201cStephen, like the president, believes that we have a finite amount of time to save our country,\u201d says Jason Miller (no relation), a former Trump spokesperson. \u201cFor these early actions, I would say that Stephen is the key implementer-in-chief.\u201d\n\nMiller has been a Trump devotee from the early days of his first presidential campaign in 2016. Then a 30-year-old adviser, he crafted policy from behind a card table in a closet-sized office on the fifth floor of Trump tower.\n\nAssociates say his attention to detail stood out from the start. \u201cDuring discussion on policy he always knew the most about any topic being discussed \u2014 from 150-year-old esoteric immigration provisions to international postal treaties,\u201d says Hunter Morgen, his former deputy.\n\nMiller\u2019s loyalty has paid off. According to Mick Mulvaney, chief of staff during Trump\u2019s first administration, \u201cStephen is probably\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the closest to the president of anybody in the West Wing at this point, now that the family is not there. He\u2019s going to be one of the critical players. He\u2019s been with the president probably the longest of anybody who\u2019s in there. The president trusts him implicitly.\u201d\n\nAs he returns to the White House a battle-hardened policy veteran, Democrats are on high alert. \u201cHe\u2019s the second most dangerous man in America after the\u00a0president \u2014 and unlike the president he actually knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d says Jim Manley, a former longtime aide to the Senate Democratic leadership.\n\nMiller was born in Santa Monica, California in 1985. His rightwing zeal was apparent early. As a 16-year-old, he called into radio shows and wrote to local newspapers, railing against the \u201crampant political correctness\u201d he said was consuming his high school.\n\nIn a 2002 letter published in the Santa Monica Lookout, he hit out at bilingual announcements, the availability of contraception, the \u201cfoster[ing]\u201d of homosexuality, the failure to recite the pledge of allegiance and the negative depiction of US history. \u201cForget about being the nation that stopped Hitler, brought communism to its knees, and feeds more hungry people around the world than any other country \u2014 forget all of that, and let us just agree that we are a horrible nation. Or, we can raise our flags, lift our guns, and proclaim that we are Americans,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAfter studying at Duke University, he entered Republican politics, where he quickly made a name for himself. Former Tea Party congresswoman Michele Bachmann remembers him as a \u201cserious, tireless communications director who quickly proved his intellect and talent\u201d. Dave Brat, the economics professor who Miller helped oust House majority leader Eric Cantor in 2014, says he was a \u201cstraight shooter\u201d who put \u201cempirics\u201d over \u201cemotion\u201d.\n\nBut it was with Alabama senator Jeff Sessions that he honed his skills as a hype-man. Sessions previously told the Financial Times that he had asked Miller, then a staffer in his Senate office, to introduce him at an event when someone pulled out. Miller was so good in the role, according to Sessions, that he became a regular fixture.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential race, Sessions was one of the first Republicans to endorse Trump and Miller soon joined the real estate tycoon on the campaign trail. Trump often used the young ideologue as a warm-up act.\n\nBut it was in policy that Miller would make himself invaluable, putting into action the president\u2019s anti-immigration plans. During Trump\u2019s first term he shaped nativist policies including the separation of families, the shortlived so-called Muslim travel ban and the ending of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme.\n\nGroups representing immigrants fear his return to the heart of government. \u201cWe are deeply, deeply concerned,\u201d says Vanessa C\u00e1rdenas, director of America\u2019s Voice, an NGO.\u00a0\u201cIt is incredibly troubling that he is back and frankly in charge of immigration policy \u2014 and also has tentacles all over our government.\u201d\n\nWhile immigration might be his driver, Miller plans to make his mark in other areas too \u2014 reshaping America\u2019s relationship with the world and overhauling what he sees as a \u201ccorrupt and broken\u201d system at home. \u201cHow is Stephen spending his days,\u201d asks Mulvaney. \u201cIt\u2019s immigration, immigration, immigration, then trade policy, then the deep state.\u201d\n\nmyles.mccormick@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/12b37d7f-ed71-42b1-a610-1893a9828ad5"}}, {"id": "ee3b9ded-c3aa-486c-86bf-e5bd2e748403", "event_name": "Europe can import disillusioned talent from Trump\u2019s US, says Lagarde", "blurb": "ECB president defends continent\u2019s strengths and insists it is \u2018not a basket case\u2019", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "Europe may be able to attract disillusioned \u201ctalent\u201d from across the Atlantic following Donald Trump\u2019s election, the European Central Bank president has suggested, as she called on the continent to better recognise its economic strengths.\n\nChristine Lagarde said Europe needed to get better at keeping its talent and savings at home, adding that the new US administration\u2019s decision to freeze some funding for former president Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act might remove one of the incentives to invest in the US.\n\nWithout making a direct reference to Trump, the French central banker indicated that some American residents might be attracted to Europe in the wake of the US inauguration.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep the talent at home.

Bridges from the mainland were closed, as police dealt with downed power lines and scoured homes for survivors, or the bodies of victims, so he hitched a lift on a motorboat. After 20 minutes dodging unmoored vessels and other floating debris, they arrived at his dock, from where he surveyed the damage.\n\nThe receding storm surge had left 20 or so giant rubbish bins littered on the lawn. His neighbour\u2019s floating dock, detached in the storm, had become a battering ram, smashing a path through his patio doors for the oncoming water. Inside the house, where the toxic mess of gasoline, oils and sewage had reached nearly 4ft, furniture lay upended and strewn among seagrass and mud \u2014 a Baldwin upright piano, a grandfather clock, a refrigerator, broken precious glassware.\n\nFlorida\u2019s increasingly savage hurricane season had been growing its financial burden for years. Sawyer\u2019s insurance premiums, set at $4,000 per year when he arrived from Cincinnati 10 years earlier, had edged up to $7,500. Earlier in 2024, his fire and wind insurer had abruptly refused to renew his policy, precipitating a chaotic rush for a replacement before his lender\u00a0arranged its own exorbitantly priced substitute or withdrew\u00a0his mortgage.\n\nSoon, the dent left by Helene would make those items look like small change. By one estimate, up to $30bn of US property damage from the hurricane would turn out to be uninsured. By October, a neighbour four doors down, whose home had been valued at $940,000 before the hurricane hit, would have agreed to sell it for $699,000, the garden still full of the detritus carried there by the storm, just to get out. By Christmas, only seven of the 65 surrounding homes would be occupied, and half of Sawyer\u2019s immediate neighbours would have left for good.\n\nAll of this lay ahead of him, however. On that September morning, his mind was on the lost urn containing the remains of his mother and younger brother that he hadn\u2019t got around to scattering; it was on the thousands of photos he had planned to digitise someday, strewn through the home, matted together in dense clumps, their dyes slowly leaking into the salty water \u2014 family weddings, holidays, nieces and nephews growing up.\n\nFrom the boat, he contemplated the move from Cincinnati, the 10 years spent in the house, the damage its disfigurement would cause to the architecture of his memories. Surveying the desolation he wondered: had it been worth it?\n\nAcross the world, a slew of floods, wildfires and storms is shifting the balance of risk and reward attached to homes abutting forests, mountains, coasts and rivers.\n\nThe most visible impact is on those affected by catastrophe, who face the trauma and grief of a home\u2019s partial or total destruction, the financial shocks from underinsurance and the growing risk that, once rebuilt, even a new, safer home could be uninsurable.\n\nBut increasingly, even in locations seen as safe, homeowners are confronting spiralling insurance premiums and the prospect of a fall in capital values if insurers scale back or withdraw.\n\nHurricanes, fires and other disasters caused $320bn in losses last year, 30 per cent more than 2023, according to Munich Re, the world\u2019s largest reinsurance group. Insurers will be on the hook for $140bn of these, making 2024 the most expensive for the global industry since 2017, when the hurricane trio of Harvey, Irma and Maria struck the US.\n\nMany property markets in regions devastated by natural disaster have stopped in their tracks. Nearly three months after Valencia\u2019s devastating floods, mortgage approvals in the affected areas have almost entirely ceased as lenders await revised surveys to better understand the properties\u2019 risk, according to Juan Vill\u00e9n, head of the mortgage arm of Idealista, the Spanish property website.\u00a0\u201cBanks have ordered new appraisals to ensure that properties have not been affected by [the storm], before granting the loan,\u201d he says.\n\nAs insurers bear the weight of huge payouts across the world, the ripples are being felt in rising home insurance premiums in the safest locations.\n\nJoanna Shipton, one of six owners, has a flat in Marden Hill House, a Grade II*-listed house in Hertfordshire, about 90 minutes north of London, which dates from the 17th century.\u00a0Given the building\u2019s particular risks \u2014 including its age and listing, which makes repairs expensive \u2014 only one insurer will cover it, and the premium has increased from \u00a318,000 per year in 2019 to \u00a325,800 today.\n\n\u201cThey have us over a barrel,\u201d says Shipton, who is also treasurer of the management company the residents formed to run the building. Her share of the annual service charge is currently \u00a310,800; on top of that, higher energy prices mean bills for heating her poorly insulated home have rocketed in the past couple of years.\n\nShe and her husband listed their home for sale in August for \u00a32.7mn. Today, with the price cut to \u00a32.3mn, Shipton worries the high running costs may be putting buyers off.\n\n\u201cHousehold insurers have lost so much money they have become a lot fussier,\u201d says Clare Blakely of UK insurance broker Weatherbys Hamilton. They are now more reluctant to take on those with risk factors \u2014 such as a thatched roof, tall trees or water nearby. Since heavy rains caused extensive flooding in London in July 2021, questions about flat roofs, a cellar, lower ground floor or a basement have become standard, she adds.\n\nLast year, UK property insurance payouts hit their highest level for 20 years, according to Deloitte. Following years of underwriting losses, many are forecasting widespread premium increases: despite a surge for at-risk homes, the average price, adjusting for inflation, of a UK building and contents policy has not changed since 2017. In that time claims have increased by 72 per cent.\n\nBefore devastating wildfires erupted earlier this month in Los Angeles, the city\u2019s residents had long walked the tightrope between the glamour of its location and the risks.\n\n\u201cPacific Palisades, Pasadena, Santa Monica, these neighbourhoods have a charisma \u2014 storied, enchanting, so physically beautiful, so rich culturally and historically \u2014 despite being earthquake- and fire-prone,\u201d says John Vaillant, author of Fire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter World, which tells the story of the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire that tore through the bitumen mining area in Alberta, Canada. \u201cThat is a tension that west coast Americans are comfortable with.\u201d\n\nEven equipped with Vaillant\u2019s account, however, my conversation with Alisa Ruby Bash is disorientating. For the 49-year-old, arriving in Los Angeles aged 18 was the fulfilment of a dream. \u201cMy entire childhood I wanted to be an actress and a singer,\u201d she says. Fifteen years ago, her dream materialised into a home on Enchanted Way on the edge of Pacific Palisades. She had it all: a beautiful detached house in one of the city\u2019s most desirable neighbourhoods, \u201csafe from crime, surrounded by celebrities and successful people\u201d.\n\nBut on January 7, with only Palisades Drive between it and Topanga State Park, the house was one of the first to burn. In the rush to evacuate, her family left only with their passports, computers and the cat. \u201cMy home of 15 years, every single thing we own, all my belongings from my entire life [are gone],\u201d she says.\n\nAlready, she is counting the cost. Twenty-four hours after her family escaped the fire, she looked on Zillow. The website had valued her home at $3.7mn, now it had revised this to $3mn. Her insurer, has been exemplary, she says. But she can\u2019t see the $1mn they are offering covering the cost of the reconstruction, or the $700,000 covering the personal possessions the family have lost.\n\nDespite all this, she plans to rebuild her home next to the park, a location that\u2019s one of the city\u2019s most vulnerable to future wildfire. If she does leave LA, it will be because of concerns over social deterioration and fear of crime (changes she links to the pandemic), not because of the risk of more fires or an earthquake. And her favoured place to relocate to is Hawaii, where the last significant storm led to a major disaster declared in 2022.\n\nBash does not speak for every Angelino. But this seeming tolerance for future risk is a common feature of those who live in dangerous beautiful places, and humans more generally, according to Justin Angle, joint author of This Is Wildfire: How to Protect Yourself, Your Home, and Your Community in the Age of Heat.\n\nA former bond trader, he compares our discounting of natural disaster risk to investors during asset bubbles, so preoccupied with gorging on present rewards, they ignore the possibility the feast could come to an end. \u201cWe have acclimated to the ease of not having to deal with the problem, so we don\u2019t internalise how likely it is. It\u2019s a failure of imagination. We\u2019re just really bad at understanding these slow-moving risks,\u201d he says.\n\nAngle\u2019s own case illustrates the tension.\n\nHis detached home on the edge of Missoula, a Montana mountain town, abuts a vast swath of forest running 200 miles to the Canadian border and beyond. Dotted with large cotton woods and ponderosa pines, a creek flowing through the property makes it popular with wildlife, including mountain lion, bear, deer, wolf and moose; a rich canopy of bushes and shrubs shelters his home from the summer sun.\n\nPrecisely what makes his plot attractive makes it dangerous, he concedes. \u201cThat is all material that can and will burn someday. But the sound of the water and the wildlife makes up a lot of why I chose to live here.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, efforts to nudge each other out of the imaginative deficit that underlies our skewy risk radar are fraught with social hazard, warns Vaillant.\u00a0His own home in Vancouver, Canada, combines with those of his neighbours to make a fire trap. The houses \u2014 around 100 years old and made predominantly of wood \u2014 provide excellent tinder; the roughly 2-metre gaps between them would provide an optimal wind tunnel to fan the flames.\n\nVaillant has fitted a rooftop sprinkler system that should stop nearby embers from igniting his structure for as long as the water supply lasts. But in 26 years, he has not had a single conversation about fire protection with a neighbour.\n\n\u201cWe build bubbles around ourselves. When a disaster occurs, we decide \u2018that happened to them but it won\u2019t happen to me\u2019. It isn\u2019t climate denial, it\u2019s a psychological survival technique,\u201d he says. To breach those bubbles \u2014 to force open another\u2019s imagination to the prospect of losing their most precious possession \u2014 amounts to psychological trespass.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the infando, the unutterable, it\u2019s like talking about cancer, you [thereby] admit to the possibility it could happen,\u201d he says. His job requires he carry with him a sense of the danger he lives among \u2014 he calls it his \u201cmemento mori\u201d. But to force it upon others would be a bridge too far.\n\nNearly four months after he surveyed the wreckage of his home from the motorboat, Robert Sawyer looks up at me on our Zoom call, from the sun-bathed terrace of a kava bar in downtown St Petersburg.\n\nHe wears a T-shirt, a wood-bead necklace and chain around his neck, and a contained smile that fades briefly at the more harrowing details of the ordeal, which he recounts in a measured, even tone.\u00a0He is about to move out of the hotel provided to him by Fema, the US federal disaster response agency, into a static caravan in the drive of his old home. On his lawn, the pile of ruined interiors and furniture is 30ft long, 20ft wide and 10ft high.\n\nThere\u2019s little to celebrate in his financial position. His mistake on his last insurance application left him with $30,000 of contents cover; his real loss will be closer to $130,000. With the street peppered with \u201cfor sale\u201d signs, his home, worth $1mn before the hurricane, would sell for $800,000 today, he estimates. He doubts he\u2019ll get all of the money he has just claimed from his insurer for renovations.\n\nBut there have been breaks, too. Three Persian rugs, his most expensive possessions, were due to be returned from the cleaners a few days before the hurricane hit; on a whim, he asked the company to store them until the end of the hurricane season.\u00a0When the floodwaters receded and he rushed to strip his interiors before mould set in, 20 friends and neighbours worked full days to help. \u201cWithin a week of the disaster, the insurer cut me a check for $25,000,\u201d he says. \u201cIt kept things moving.\u201d\n\nHe plans to spend upwards of $200,000 of his savings on a renovation of the house, using concrete stilts to elevate the living space clear of the minimum height required by Fema to skip obligatory flood insurance. Even in the most extreme storms, his home should hold more of its value.\n\nWith a bit of luck, a room or two will be inhabitable by June, before the hurricane season starts in earnest. \u201cI\u2019ll hang some tapestries on the side of the wall and call it glamping,\u201d he says, chuckling. \u201cAs far as being worried about putting myself in a similar situation, I don\u2019t really think too much about that \u2014 it\u2019s the cost of living in paradise and a lot of people had it a lot worse than me. In life every day you get up in the morning, take your chances and there\u2019s all kinds of things that could go wrong and no guarantees, and that makes things more interesting\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[The rebuild] will be another part of the adventure of life\u201d.\n\nNothing can change his address, though. By 2050, St Petersburg will be underwater 42 days per year, according to Nasa. For now, it is a human victory, but nature will win in the end.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow House & Home on Instagram", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4697b647-6524-4e4a-aef7-50c1bda21ab3"}}, {"id": "45850dba-c43f-4533-bd6a-f34021a6d76f", "event_name": "What\u2019s behind financiers\u2019 \u2018blind spot\u2019 on coal", "blurb": "Institutions have been unwilling to commit to firm policies on metallurgical coal", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "Welcome back. The conservative campaign against corporate diversity, equity and inclusion policies has been on a roll recently, with US companies from Walmart to McDonald\u2019s to Ford all retreating from pledges and programmes aimed at making their business more socially inclusive. But yesterday, the anti-DEI drive received a noteworthy setback.\n\nAt its annual meeting, Costco faced a shareholder proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think-tank, arguing that the retailer\u2019s DEI policies exposed it to legal and financial risks, and demanding a formal review.\n\nThe board resisted the demand, telling shareholders that the policies would \u201cattract and retain employees who will help our business succeed\u201d. Investors agreed: over 98 per cent of shares were voted against the NCPPR proposal. If companies stand up for their diversity policies, it seems, they may get more investor support than they realise.\n\nMeanwhile, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Donald Trump appeared by video link to take questions from a panel that included the chief executives of Blackstone, TotalEnergies and Santander. Trump took the chance to upbraid Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan for supposedly not doing business with conservatives, while emphasising his destruction of Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cGreen New Scam\u201d, and determination to exploit US fossil fuel reserves.\n\n\u201cNothing can destroy coal \u2014 not the weather, not a bomb \u2014 nothing,\u201d Trump said. But financial companies exposed to the coal sector face some important long-term questions, as we explore in today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nFor financiers seeking to reduce their portfolio carbon emissions, cutting exposure to thermal coal \u2014 used mainly for power generation \u2014 has been a popular choice. Far fewer have moved to cut their financing of metallurgical coal used in steelmaking \u2014 even though it packs a bigger carbon punch.\n\nWhile financial institutions are now coming under pressure from environmental groups to correct this odd imbalance, it reflects a wider problem \u2014 underscoring the need for expanded investment in green technology that will reduce steelmakers\u2019 reliance on the black stuff.\n\nYesterday, the Berlin-based non-profit group Urgewald published a new data set that sheds light on the expansion of metallurgical coal mines all over the world. It features 160 companies that are expanding 252 \u201cmet coal\u201d projects in 18 countries, with growth plans that would increase global production of the commodity by 50 per cent.\n\nMetallurgical coal is turned into coke and burnt with iron ore in blast furnaces, in an integral part of the conventional steelmaking process, which \u2014 despite the widespread adoption of coal-free electric arc furnaces \u2014 still accounts for the bulk of global production of the metal.\n\nBecause of its typically larger methane content, and generally higher emissions from its extraction, metallurgical coal accounts for nearly triple the carbon emissions of thermal coal on a tonne-for-tonne basis, according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie. This is the main reason why the steel sector accounts for roughly 11 per cent of global carbon emissions.\n\nAmong the companies with the biggest met coal expansion plans is BHP Mitsubishi Alliance, jointly owned by Australian mining company BHP and Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi. For BHP, this presents a stark contrast with its plans for a managed exit from its thermal coal business. Similarly, London-listed Glencore has been doubling down on met coal \u2014 notably through last year\u2019s $6.9bn acquisition of a majority stake in Elk Valley Resources \u2014 even as it pursues what it calls a \u201cresponsible decline strategy\u201d for thermal coal.\n\nBy way of explanation, Glencore says that it expects steelmakers\u2019 demand for coal to decline more slowly than demand from power plants. It is far from alone in that belief. In a major report on the coal sector last month, the International Energy Agency noted that investors appeared much more willing to finance new met coal projects than thermal coal mines, in part because public \u201cresistance to met coal investment is somewhat less pronounced\u201d.\n\nThis is certainly reflected in financial companies\u2019 public policies on coal. Of 386 major financial institutions tracked by Paris-based non-profit Reclaim Finance, 183 (mostly European) have announced policies restricting their financing of thermal coal. Only 16 have done the same for the metallurgical variety: 11 banks including Lloyds and ING; four asset managers including Nordea; and insurer Zurich.\n\nUrgewald argues that financiers\u2019 failure to turn their backs on metallurgical coal amounts to a \u201cblind spot\u201d in their policies. Yet, it reflects the fact that the world \u2014 and especially Europe, which accounts for most of the financial institutions with strong climate-related exclusion policies \u2014 has done a far better job of shedding its reliance on coal for electricity than it has for steelmaking.\n\nIn the EU, coal accounted for less than 10 per cent of electricity generation last year, after a strong rise in generation from increasingly cheap renewables over the past decade. More than half of the EU\u2019s steel, in contrast, was made using coal-guzzling blast furnaces. In part, that reflects the EU\u2019s gentle treatment of the steel sector under its carbon pricing system, which has imposed far lower costs on the industry relative to others.\n\nSo for European banks, cutting support for the fading thermal coal sector is a far easier step than taking the same step for metallurgical coal, which remains central to one of the region\u2019s most important industries.\n\nBut it is unlikely to retain that central role forever. Technological advances are enabling electric furnaces to produce higher grades of steel from scrap metal, decreasing the need for coal-burning blast furnaces. Many sorts of steel still require the use of \u201cvirgin iron\u201d derived from iron ore rather than scrap. But well-funded start-ups like Sweden\u2019s Stegra and Boston Metal of the US are developing new approaches to treating iron ore without coal, using hydrogen or electrolysis.\n\nIf European financial institutions were to tighten their met coal policies to match their thermal coal ones, it\u2019s unclear how much short-term impact this would have on miners\u2019 cost of capital. US institutions hardly look likely to take a corresponding move in the near future. The majority of expanding met coal companies profiled by Urgewald are in China, Russia, India and Indonesia, with limited reliance on European financing.\n\nStill, there are sound reasons to reconsider long-term financial exposure to the met coal sector. Even as producers race to increase output, the IEA predicts that demand for the commodity will decline over the next three years, as steel demand in China suffers from its chronic property market malaise. The industry\u2019s gradual evolution towards coal-free alternatives is set to continue and perhaps accelerate with steeper carbon pricing \u2014 notably through the EU\u2019s phasing out of free carbon permits for European steelmakers, and the carbon border tariff it will impose on steel imports.\n\nA crucial factor in the pace of this transition will be the amount of finance that companies are able to raise to develop and deploy green steelmaking technologies \u2014 pushing them down the cost curve, and destroying the economic logic for coal-based steel production.\n\nThe calls for western banks to commit to restricting funding for metallurgical coal are understandable. But they will probably have more impact by focusing on increasing their financing of those low-carbon alternatives.\n\nFuture foods Australia\u2019s vulnerability to climate change has helped make it a test bed for farming innovation, from experimental fungi to \u2018robotic bees\u2019.\n\nEyeing the exit President Javier Milei of Argentina is considering a proposal for the country to leave the Paris agreement on climate change.\n\nTough times BP\u2019s financial travails reflect its years of wishful thinking on fossil fuels, writes John Gapper.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/810ef183-8e87-47b7-b681-094da58657fa"}}, {"id": "3a5f37ca-4c34-4aa1-a561-838a6854940b", "event_name": "Five ways to fix the knowledge crisis in the age of Trump", "blurb": "Elites must not be complacent about a widening epistemological gulf which threatens democracy", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "A couple of days ago, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, I heard a flock of global luminaries parsing this week\u2019s inauguration of Donald Trump. Solemnly, over a dinner of grilled trout, they shared their fears about economic, political and geopolitical upheaval. Then one world leader turned to Ancient Greek.\n\n\u201cWe have an epistemological crisis,\u201d he declared, referring to the Greek words episteme (\u201cknowledge\u201d) and logos (\u201cstudy of\u201d). More specifically, different social tribes are now interpreting knowledge in such different ways that he fears \u201cdemocracy is being undermined\u201d.\n\nQuite so. Never mind that Trump has haunted Davos this week with his deliberately provocative hyperbole that \u201cweaves fact, fiction and fantasy\u201d together, as Graham Allison, a Harvard professor, told me.\n\nWhat is more notable are the findings of two recent surveys. One, conducted by the WEF, shows that for the second year in a row the meeting\u2019s (mostly) elite delegates consider \u201cdisinformation\u201d the biggest short-term global threat, above war and weather disasters. The issue did not even feature on the worry list before 2024.\n\nThe second poll, from the Edelman public relations group, shows that 61 per cent of people (in 28 countries) feel grievance towards governments, business and the wealthy \u2014 and 40 per cent support hostile action to force change.\n\nMoreover, two-thirds think that business leaders, governments and the media deliberately lie to them, a sharp increase from recent years. The fact that Trump is lashing out at elites and experts \u2014 including scientists at the National Institutes of Health \u2014 reflects this. As one pro-Trump CEO told me after the US president delivered a bombastic address to WEF: \u201cpeople are angry.\u201d\n\nSo how should elites and experts respond? Judging from the Davos chatter, two responses predominate. Some business leaders (such as those in tech) are simply ignoring Trump\u2019s \u201cfictions\u201d to cut deals. Others (like outraged progressives) are dismissing him and his supporters as deluded, stupid or evil \u2014 and wishing that Trump would disappear and/or regulators and Big Tech would \u201ccorrect\u201d lies.\n\nHowever, I would suggest there is another route: leaders should ponder what they themselves can do to help heal this epistemological divide. How? There are several possible steps. The first is to engage in \u201cdeep listening\u201d, to cite the concept championed by the journalist Emily Kasriel. That means hearing what Trump\u2019s supporters are saying with as few preconceived filters as possible. We need empathy to understand why public grievance has exploded.\n\nWe also need this to grasp another point: many of Trump\u2019s supporters believe that they are in a battle to save western civilisation \u2014 and with the same emotional intensity as, say, climate activists. That can\u2019t be dismissed or scorned.\n\nSecond, if leaders want to restore public respect for expertise they must embrace the \u201cerror bar\u201d, the long-standing scientific principle that researchers should honestly indicate their level of confidence in research results. This was forgotten during the pandemic, when politicians made dogmatic statements about medical issues (vaccines, for instance) \u2014 and sometimes curbed debate \u2014 even when the science was provisional.\n\nThat was understandable, perhaps, amid the panic. But it has contributed to public cynicism about \u201cexperts\u201d, as the entrepreneur Peter Thiel recently noted in the FT. So leaders of all political stripes must embrace the error bar in future if they want to restore credibility.\n\nThird, leaders must (as I have often written before) acknowledge that vertical trust \u2014 in authority figures and institutions \u2014 is collapsing today. Instead, people are increasingly relying on peer groups or local communities as sources of advice (in other words, on lateral trust relations). Leaders might hate this, but they must work with it \u2014 not wish it away.\n\nFourth, if you believe in the enlightenment principle of critical reasoning, you must put your money behind that. That means paying for quality journalism, backing intellectual inquiry at think-tanks and universities and promoting this in policymaking. For inspiration, look at 314action.org, a political action committee created by American scientists which aims to put more scientists into public office. It has already rallied thousands of volunteers. But far more could be done.\n\nFifth, leaders should champion initiatives to counter online misinformation. That does not mean using hierarchical power to crush free speech. But it does mean installing guardrails against violent activism and supporting community fact-checking platforms. These crowd-focused tools are now the main recourse against online lies, since Meta and others have decided to cut content moderation.\n\nThese steps are not a magic wand. But they are better than appeasement, despair and blame. The hard truth is that neither Big Tech nor government can or will fix the epistemological crisis. The responsibility sits with us all.\n\ngillian.tett@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b4de95a2-c0da-4de8-8ad4-097f0d045633"}}, {"id": "6bedb04c-725e-41c2-ac75-1b24b1a4a7d8", "event_name": "Wall Street will stymie Donald Trump\u2019s US oil surge plan, say shale bosses", "blurb": "Output set to rise more slowly under new president than during Joe Biden\u2019s term", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "President Donald Trump\u2019s call for a new oil boom will be thwarted by Wall Street\u2019s reluctance to approve another drilling binge, shale bosses\u00a0have warned.\n\nTotal US oil output in Trump\u2019s second term will rise by less than 1.3mn barrels a day, said Rystad Energy and Wood Mackenzie, well below the 1.9mn b/d rise achieved under Joe Biden and much less than in the shale bonanza years in the previous decade.\n\nExecutives said investor pressure on companies and the economic realities of a sector always beholden to oil prices would be obstacles to Trump\u2019s quest to launch an era of \u201cAmerican energy dominance\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe incentive, if you will, to just drill, baby, drill\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.

He has also moved to eliminate Biden-era regulations that drillers say increased their costs and restricted activity.\n\nBut executives warned that even Trump\u2019s full-throated support for fossil fuels and deregulation could have limited impact.\n\n\u201cAs much as the incoming administration is very favourable around energy and power\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we don\u2019t see a significant change in activity levels going forward,\u201d said David Schorlemer, chief financial officer of ProPetro, an oilfield services company in the Permian.\n\nProducers\u2019 reluctance comes after two decades of soaring growth \u2014 and sometimes punishing oil price volatility.\n\nUS oil and gas production exploded in the past 15 years as drillers found ways to unlock vast deposits locked in shale rocks. Wall Street funded a headlong drilling race that made the US the world\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer.\n\nBut brutal price crashes in 2014 and 2020 triggered widespread bankruptcies, a more cautious approach from investors and a change in producers\u2019 behaviour \u2014 especially in the face of softer crude prices.\n\nA recent Kansas City Federal Reserve survey found that the average US oil price needed for a substantial increase in drilling was $84 a barrel, versus about $74 a barrel today.\n\nJPMorgan predicts that US oil prices will drift down to $64 a barrel by the end of this year and shale activity will \u201cslow to a crawl\u201d in 2026.\n\n\u201cIf prices are anaemic, you can remove all the red tape you want. It\u2019s not going to move the needle on production,\u201d said Hassan Eltorie, director of companies and transaction research at S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\nAmerica\u2019s second-biggest oil producer Chevron \u2014 a huge shale investor \u2014 plans to cut spending this year for the first time since the pandemic oil crash, budgeting $14.5bn to $15.5bn for 2025, down from $15.5bn to $16.5bn last year. Exxon, by comparison, will raise its capex in the coming years.\n\nConocoPhillips expects to lower spending by $500mn from last year, and Occidental Petroleum and EOG Resources are to hold activity levels roughly flat \u2014 decisions designed to please Wall Street.\n\n\u201cThe shareholders of these energy stocks\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. if you do more [capital spending] than they would allow, they will scream bloody murder and sell your stock,\u201d said Cole Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management, which invests in a handful of oil companies, including Chevron and Occidental Petroleum.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3f4c07ee-7a75-467d-9cc7-53e81c579874"}}, {"id": "9814223d-e44b-422d-a08e-02b9c4bdb07b", "event_name": "The Big Question: Are you expecting a bigger bonus this year?", "blurb": "A removal of the cap means financial rewards in the City are likely to be more lucrative than they recently have been", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "As bonus season gets under way for those who work in the City, we want to know if your payout will be bigger or smaller than last year\u2019s.\n\nThe financial rewards, usually handed out between mid-January and mid-February, have the potential to be even more lucrative than in previous years after UK and US banks lifted EU-imposed bonus caps.

They work wonders on industries previously fettered by regulation. But there is little evidence that this has been the case for US fossil fuels. That suggests President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to expedite oil and gas projects will deliver a trickle, not a flood.\n\nOil producers have been \u201cdrill, baby, drilling\u201d for quite some time. In 2024, US oil production averaged 13.2mn barrels a day, making it the largest oil producer in the world. That\u2019s two-and-a-half times what the country was producing in 2008. The supply of US gas, too, has roughly doubled during that period.\n\nTrue, this breakneck pace cannot continue forever. The industry will add an extra 270,000 barrels a day on average in 2025 and 2026, according to consultancy Argus Media, roughly a quarter of what it squeezed out in 2023. But that largely reflects the fact that a lot of the best acreage has already been exploited.\n\nTrumpian policies, like encouraging drilling in US coastal waters, will open up new territories. Even if they contain exploitable resources, though, the time it takes to develop a project extends beyond the length of a single four-year presidential term. This is no short-term fix.\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, what inhibits the flow of oil is not red tape, but low prices. Producing oil from US shale formations is relatively expensive. Companies need prices to be somewhere between $60 and $80 a barrel if they want to cover all their costs and pay dividends, estimates Christopher Wheaton at Stifel.\n\nShale is also highly sensitive to commodity price moves because, unlike traditional projects in which much of the cost is sunk upfront, maintaining shale output requires constant spending. By way of example, the record low price for US natural gas in 2024 has already caused production to nudge lower.\n\nThat rather limits Trump\u2019s room for manoeuvre, at least with oil. Gas may be a bit more responsive, given there is some hope that strong demand, not least from data centres, and the resumption of LNG export permitting might raise domestic prices. That would help producers justify more supply.\n\nAs it stands, the oil market is hardly undersupplied. A spluttering China translates into weak demand. Opec+, which wants to see prices stay high, is sufficiently worried that it is actively holding back supply. That means that any increase in US oil production is likely to push down prices and thus be shortlived. The only thing gushing in the oil patch is rhetoric.\n\ncamilla.palladino@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/389a05c0-dd8a-4645-820e-9e6741359144"}}, {"id": "ed8c4d2d-897a-44cb-ace4-abbe6e38c015", "event_name": "US stocks at most expensive relative to bonds since dotcom era", "blurb": "Level last seen in 2002 as tech-fuelled equity rally throws up red flag on \u2018Fed model\u2019 for comparing valuations", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "US equities have soared to their most expensive level relative to government bonds in a generation, amid growing nervousness among some investors over high valuations of megacap technology companies and other Wall Street stocks.\n\nA record-breaking run for US equities, which hit a fresh high on Wednesday, has pushed the so-called forward earnings yield \u2014 expected profits as a percentage of stock prices \u2014 on the S&P 500 index down to 3.9 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. A sell-off in Treasuries has driven 10-year bond yields up to 4.65 per cent.\n\nThat means the difference between the two, a measure of the so-called equity risk premium, or the extra compensation to an investor for the risk of owning stocks, has fallen into negative territory and reached a level last seen in 2002 during the dotcom boom and bust.\n\n\u201cInvestors are effectively saying \u2018I want to own these dominant tech companies and I am prepared to do it without much of a risk premium,\u2019\u201d said Ben Inker, co-head of asset allocation at asset manager GMO. \u201cI think that is a crazy attitude.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said the US\u2019s steep equity valuations, labelled the \u201cmother of all bubbles\u201d, were the result of fund managers clamouring for exposure to the country\u2019s buoyant economic and corporate profits growth, as well as a belief among many investors that they cannot risk leaving the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks out of their portfolios.\n\n\u201cThe questions we are getting from clients are, on the one hand, concerns about market concentration and how top heavy the market has become,\u201d Inker said. \u201cBut, on the other side, people are asking \u2018shouldn\u2019t we just own these just dominant companies because they are going to take over the world?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe traditionally constructed equity risk premium is sometimes known as the \u201cFed model\u201d, because Alan Greenspan appeared to refer to it at times when he was chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nHowever, the model has its detractors. A 2003 paper by Cliff Asness, founder of fund firm AQR, criticised the use of Treasury yields as an \u201cirrelevant\u201d nominal benchmark and said the equity risk premium failed as a predictive tool for stock returns.\n\nSome analysts now employ an equity risk premium that compares stocks\u2019 earning yield to inflation-adjusted US bond yields. On this reading, the equity risk premium is also \u201cat its lowest level since the dotcom era\u201d, said Miroslav Aradski, senior analyst at BCA Research, although it is not negative.\n\nThe premium could even understate how expensive stocks are, Aradski added, because it implicitly assumes that the earnings yield is a good proxy for the future real total return from equities.\n\nGiven that profit margins are above their historic average, if they were to \u201crevert towards their historic norms, earnings growth could end up being very weak\u201d, he said.\n\nSome market watchers look to altogether different measures. Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, is sharply critical of the Fed model and said the right way to compute the equity risk premium was to use expectations of cash flows and cash payout ratios.\n\nBy his calculations, the equity risk premium has declined over the past 12 months and is close to its lowest level in the past 20 years, but is \u201cdefinitely not negative\u201d.\n\nEquities\u2019 valuation relative to bonds is just one measure of exuberance cited by managers. Others include US stocks\u2019 price-to-earnings valuation against their own history or compared with stocks in other regions.\n\n\u201cThere are quite a few red flags here that should make us a bit cautious,\u201d said Chris Jeffery, head of macro at Legal & General\u2019s asset management division. \u201cThe most uncomfortable one is the difference between the way that US equities and non-US equities are priced.\u201d\n\nMany investors argue that high multiples are justified and can be sustained. \u201cIt is undeniable that [US stocks\u2019 price-to-earnings] multiple is high relative to history, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it is higher than it should be, given the underlying environment,\u201d said Goldman Sachs\u2019 senior equity strategist Ben Snider.\n\nOn Goldman\u2019s own model, which suggests what the PE ratio for the US blue-chip equity index should be, after taking account of the interest rate environment, labour market health and other factors, the S&P is \u201cin line with our modelled fair value\u201d, Snider said.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that earnings are growing and, even with unchanged valuations, earnings growth should drive equity prices higher,\u201d he added.\n\nUS stocks have now regained all the ground lost during a fall since December. That sell-off highlighted some investors\u2019 concerns that there was a level of Treasury yields that the stock market rally could not live with, because bonds \u2014 a traditional haven asset \u2014 would appear so attractive.\n\nPimco\u2019s chief investment officer said this week that relative valuations between bonds and equities \u201care about as wide as we\u2019ve seen in a long time\u201d, and the same policies that could take bond yields higher threatened to hit stocks.\n\nFor others, US stocks\u2019 declining risk premium is just another reflection of investors piling into Big Tech stocks and the risk that concentration in a small number of big names poses to portfolios.\n\n\u201cEven though the momentum is strong on the Mag 7, this is the year where you want to be diversified on your equity exposure,\u201d said Andrew Pease, chief investment strategist at Russell Investments, in reference to the seven major tech stocks.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f8b6dbb5-eb9b-4639-b72a-e7c9b2925bb3"}}, {"id": "17ee974c-2749-4973-aacf-6838b34327f0", "event_name": "ETFs increase efficiency of markets, new study shows", "blurb": "Academic findings on macro-market behaviour contradict widely accepted previous research", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "The growth of exchange traded funds has improved the efficiency of stock markets, according to new research that runs counter to some previous claims.\n\nThe global ETF industry has ballooned to almost $15tn in assets, a more than fivefold increase in the past decade, according to figures from consultancy ETFGI, with all but $1tn of this in passive, index-tracking funds.\n\nNew research from academics from the US, UK and France argues that this surge in passive money has made equity markets more efficient, contradicting some previous research that has found the opposite.\n\nThe ongoing academic debate may ultimately influence the thinking of regulators at a time when some on both the left and the right of the political spectrum have raised concerns over the increasing power of the triumvirate of BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors, which dominate the global ETF industry.\n\nThe latest academic analysis suggests the growth of ETFs has improved the efficiency of stock pricing at the market level, a concept dubbed \u201cmacro-efficiency\u201d, reducing the prevalence of mispricing.\n\nThis greater efficiency is most pronounced during periods of volatility, a time when defects in market structure are most likely to be exposed.\n\nIn addition, the analysis found the improvement in pricing efficiency was \u201clargely absent\u201d in emerging markets, where uptake of ETFs is typically far lower than in developed markets such as the US and Europe.\n\nAndrew Clare, professor of asset management at London\u2019s Bayes Business School and co-author of the paper, said the work drew on the past findings of late Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson, who found that markets are \u201cmicro efficient\u201d but \u201cmacro inefficient\u201d, ie, the efficient markets hypothesis works much better for individual stocks than for the wider stock market. Fellow Nobel laureate Robert Shiller was among those who corroborated Samuelson\u2019s findings.\n\nHowever, Clare and his colleagues found financial markets may have changed since Samuelson made his observations and macro efficiency has increased since the widespread take up of ETFs.\n\n\u201cOur findings have significant implications for investors. In equity markets that are more developed, and hence have higher levels of macro efficiency, a top-down approach to portfolio construction would appear to be increasingly necessary for effective risk management,\u201d said the paper, ETF adoption and equity market macro-efficiency, which is set to be published in The Journal of Portfolio Management.\n\nIf so, one question would be why? Widescale ETF adoption may be new but index-based mutual funds have been around for much longer. But Clare believed the two product types are used in different ways \u2014 mutual funds are \u201cmore of a buy-and-hold type of investment\u201d, while ETFs can be traded on a daily or even intraday basis, he said.\n\nMore rapid absorption of information into market-level pricing might also be thought to lead to greater volatility, as stock prices are more likely to rise and fall together in unison, without offsetting movements. However, Clare said the research did not find that.\n\nInstead, he argued that the findings were positive for the ETF industry, unlike some other analyses.\n\nResearch by Valentin Haddad, associate professor of finance at UCLA Anderson School of Management and his colleagues in 2022 is one such analysis. It concluded that the rise of passive investing was distorting price signals and pushing up the volatility of the US stock market.\n\nEarlier analysis cited in Clare\u2019s paper argues that rising ETF ownership could lead to mispricing effects, as an increase in commonality of ownership across a market might weaken the link between an earnings announcement and the price of the relevant stock.\n\nIn contrast, Clare\u2019s paper concludes that \u201cpassive management instruments may not be a source of market inefficiency as others have claimed in the past. Instead, our results suggest that they may improve equity market efficiency.\n\n\u201cETFs allow investors to manage portfolio exposures to aggregate risks in a more efficient manner than would be the case if these exposures could only be accessed by trading individual stocks.\u201d\n\nKenneth Lamont, principal of research at Morningstar, agreed with the \u201csentiment\u201d of the paper, in that \u201cETFs have been one of the key tools behind the democratisation of finance, allowing all investors to make low-cost, immediate bets on markets [which] has undoubtedly contributed to the increased efficiency of financial markets in recent years\u201d.\n\nHowever, Lamont argued that the growth of ETFs \u201chas been inextricably linked with the growth of modern financial markets in general. Divining which of the gains in market efficiency can be linked to ETFs\u00a0and which to the wide range of other evolutions in the financial markets such as improvements in data, the rise of high-frequency electronic trading, improvements in trading infrastructure etc, which have also developed in parallel to ETFs is probably impossible.\u201d\n\nUCLA\u2019s Haddad believed there were \u201creasons to be somewhat sceptical\u201d about the argument that if people increasingly trade the broad market, rather than individual stocks, that trading becomes more efficient.\n\n\u201cThe ETFs themselves do not try to time the market, it is the flow in and out of them that does so. If we think that these flows are mostly driven by individuals or unsophisticated institutions, it is difficult to expect them to make prices more efficient. Most modern evidence suggests for example that they extrapolate returns, as opposed to being contrarian which would be optimal.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Clare argued that he and his colleagues\u2019 findings meant regulators should welcome the growth of ETFs and \u201cbe cautious about restricting their development\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of criticism of ETFs and how they are making the world inefficient,\u201d Clare said. \u201cWe find the opposite. They are making the market more efficient rather than more inefficient, and more stable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good news story for the ETF industry.

That seems an appropriate name, too, for the massive artificial intelligence infrastructure project promising to invest as much as $500bn in the US over the next four years, announced by President Donald Trump on Tuesday evening. Backed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, Stargate reflects the alternative reality created by the fusion of the AI superbubble and Trump\u2019s re-election. Washington, it seems, is disappearing down its own wormhole.\n\n\u201cThis monumental undertaking is a resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential under a new president,\u201d Trump said of Stargate. Standing stiffly in their suits alongside Trump in the White House, Larry Ellison, Oracle\u2019s 80-year-old co-founder, Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s vauntingly ambitious chief executive, and Masayoshi Son, SoftBank\u2019s mercurial chair, all beamed with pleasure, like the personifications of old tech, new tech and global tech.\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of a golden age,\u201d Son said, playing back Trump\u2019s remarks in his inauguration address. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without you, Mr President,\u201d gushed Altman. The prominent presence of several other tech billionaires at Trump\u2019s inauguration also highlighted how much they are in thrall to the US president.\n\nCurtis Yarvin, the neo-reactionary blogger and champion of the Dark Enlightenment movement who has a cult following in some west coast circles, has argued that democracy is done and called for a more authoritarian kind of techno-monarchy. Trump\u2019s \u201cfirst buddy\u201d Elon Musk has already taken to calling himself the technoking of Tesla. But, surrounded by his nerdy courtiers, it could be Trump who has emerged as the technoking of America.\n\nTrump has made it clear that he wants to reassert US hegemony in technology over China, particularly in AI. He has already rescinded his predecessor Joe Biden\u2019s executive order on AI safety. He also seems intent on deregulating crypto and reversing the antitrust agenda of the Biden administration to give Big Tech even freer rein. Sniffing profits and new opportunities in the defence, nuclear and space industries, the biggest US tech companies have been quick to applaud Trump\u2019s moves.\n\nThese companies already rank among the richest and most powerful in history and need little help from Trump. The independent research firm Arete forecasts that five of them \u2014 Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft \u2014 will this year collectively increase their revenue to more than $2tn. In spite of laying out $300bn on capital expenditure, Arete predicts they will still hit record profit margins and generate free cash flow of $430bn.\n\nYet three things may yet check their dominance. The first is that competition is intensifying between the biggest tech companies themselves as they all make colossal bets on AI and try to disrupt each others\u2019 business models. \u201cBig Tech can no longer deliver growth by staying in their respective lanes,\u201d says Richard Kramer, Arete\u2019s founder. \u201cWe expect more Hunger Games-style competition between Big Tech, attacking each other\u2019s \u2018core\u2019 business, in consumer tech hardware, cloud services, content and ecommerce.\u201d\n\nThat competition is also increasingly acquiring a legal dimension as tech companies attack each other in court. Musk is suing OpenAI and Altman claiming that he, and others, were duped into investing in the AI start-up because of its \u201cfake humanitarian mission\u201d. He also trolled the Stargate announcement this week, posting on X: \u201cThey don\u2019t actually have the money.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft has testified against Google to break up its search monopoly. As Matt Stoller, author of the Big newsletter on monopoly power, has written, individuals, companies and states may pursue antitrust actions even if Washington holds back. \u201cAntitrust is a body of law that\u2019s designed for business leaders to fight with one another,\u201d Stoller wrote.\n\nHowever, some leading venture capital investors in Silicon Valley, led by Marc Andreessen, have also been warning of the dangers of large companies weaponising the government to crush start-ups and stifle innovation. They have been promoting the virtues of Little Tech, which they claim has always been the \u201cvanguard of American technology supremacy\u201d. Vice-president JD Vance, a former VC investor, has in the past supported antitrust interventions to promote competition, arguing against \u201cthis weird idea that something can\u2019t be tyrannical if it comes through the operation of a free market\u201d.\n\nOne of the biggest determinants of tech policy may simply be who has the greatest access to the technoking\u2019s ear.\n\njohn.thornhill@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ffcd84d1-822c-492c-94e2-07785cfe3524"}}, {"id": "c946c1a9-b143-4671-828e-7f7330226ae3", "event_name": "What happened to the Trump \u2018resistance\u2019?", "blurb": "Disorganised and dispirited, those opposed to the US president\u2019s policies have grown unexpectedly quiet", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "Eight years ago, a sea of angry women, many wearing \u201cpink pussy hats\u201d, descended on Washington a day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, in one of the largest political demonstrations in US history.\n\nVanessa Wruble was a driving force behind the Women\u2019s March in the US capital, inspired by the perceived threat Trump posed to reproductive and civil rights.

There has been no repeat of the demonstrations in airports and courthouses in 2017 that challenged one of Trump\u2019s first anti-immigration directives, a controversial 90-day ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nThe scarcity of anti-Trump voices outside a few prominent congressional Democrats has been so notable that the one woman willing to confront the president directly in recent days \u2014 an Episcopalian priest \u2014 has become a minor national celebrity.\n\nAt an inaugural prayer service in Washington on Tuesday, Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde asked the new president to \u201chave mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now\u201d, including immigrants, asylum seekers and families with LGBT+ children.\n\nBut in a sign of the public obloquy risked by the president\u2019s critics, Trump denounced Edgar Budde as a \u201cradical left hardline Trump hater\u201d, who had \u201cbrought her church into the world of politics in a very ungracious way\u201d and now \u201cowe[s] the public an apology\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s opponents have not been idle. On the day of his inauguration, attorneys-general from 22 states sued him in two federal district courts to block an executive order that refused to recognise children born in the US of unauthorised immigrants as citizens. They argued birthright citizenship under the US constitution\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment is \u201cautomatic\u201d. On Thursday, they won a minor victory when a federal judge temporarily blocked the order.\n\nSkye Perryman, head of Democracy Forward, a legal group that launched a number of challenges against Trump\u2019s policies during his first term, argued the lawsuits are a sign the nature of opposition to him has changed, rather than any unwillingness by his adversaries to take action.\n\n\u201cThe reaction this time is much more sophisticated and organised opposition to what is now a very far-right movement in the US,\u201d Perryman said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing an opposition that\u2019s focused on exploiting this administration\u2019s over-reach and disregard for the law.\u201d\n\nSome polls back her claim that Trump\u2019s most radical policies lack popular support. A Quinnipiac University survey from last month showed 55 per cent wanted to give undocumented immigrants a pathway to legal status, while 63 per cent said all children born in the US should continue to be automatically granted citizenship.\n\nBut there is little consensus in Democratic ranks over how best to confront Trump and mobilise opposition to his policies. After his first term, a simple call for \u201cresistance\u201d to Trumpism proved enough to rally voters \u2014 particularly swing voters in suburban districts \u2014 to their side. It helped propel Joe Biden to victory in the 2020 election and gave Democrats control of the US Senate in 2021.\n\nIn 2022, they outperformed in the midterm elections too, spurred by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to end federal protections for abortions.\n\nBut in 2024, Trump\u2019s temperament and the issue of abortion rights were clear to voters nationwide \u2014 and Democrats still lost the presidency and both houses of Congress.\n\nThat electoral hat-trick appears to have convinced some in the party to move closer to Trump on issues such as border control. Senator John Fetterman, an iconoclastic Democrat from Pennsylvania, visited Trump in his Mar-a-Lago resort before the inauguration.\n\nOthers on the Democratic left, such as New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, argue that only by clearly drawing distinctions with Trump \u2014 on issues such as immigration and his cosying up to wealthy corporate leaders \u2014 can the party regain its footing.\n\nBut some are nevertheless unimpressed by the timidity of the party\u2019s initial response. \u201cLast time the Democrats brought a knife to a gunfight,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cNow there\u2019s not even a knife.\u201d\n\nIn particular, she said, there was \u201cno one voice leading the charge against Trump and what the Republicans are doing\u201d. Democrats lack a figure with the stature and authority of Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker who dominated her party when he first took office in 2017.\n\nAnd there is no automatic mechanism for them to select a new leader who could be Trump\u2019s chief antagonist. Some polls show Kamala Harris remains the country\u2019s most prominent Democrat, but she has been wounded by her defeat to Trump in November, holds no elective office, and has been keeping a low profile in recent months.\n\nLow morale continues to dog the party. \u201cThe word that gets thrown around a lot right now is exhaustion,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, a non-partisan analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\n\nMuch of the resistance provoked by Trump\u2019s first victory arose because \u201cit was seen as a fluke\u201d, he said. This time he \u201cwon much more clearly\u201d, gaining a plurality of the popular vote.\n\nDemocrats also understand American public opinion has shifted rightward since Trump\u2019s first term. Four years ago there was widespread \u2014 and bipartisan \u2014 disgust at the January 6 2021 siege of the Capitol. But a poll by CBS this month showed only 30 per cent of Republicans strongly disapproved of the attack, compared to 51 per cent in January 2021.\n\nActivists admit to being in a state of shock. Transgender groups, for example, are reeling from a Trump executive order that said it was the policy of the US to recognise only two sexes, male and female.\n\nRodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, head of Advocates for Trans Equality, said transgender people were \u201cworried and anxious rather than outraged\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. but the outrage will come\u201d.\n\n\u201cResistance will grow as people understand the scope and scale of all these executive orders,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it takes time to realise what\u2019s at stake.\u201d\n\nYet Wruble thinks the next wave of resistance will look a lot different from the last one. \u201cOur methods of intervention failed us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a period of reflection. We need to come up with new responses.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by James Politi in Washington\n\nData visualisation by Sam Learner", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/862e0b9e-151a-4d7a-b020-8db473da94eb"}}, {"id": "b642c431-de12-410c-a79e-91d388bd4290", "event_name": "Donald Trump piles pressure on Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell to cut interest rates", "blurb": "US central bank widely expected to hold borrowing costs steady at meeting next week", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Donald Trump has raised the pressure on Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell to cut borrowing costs, setting up a potential clash between the two men less than a week before the US central bank meets to set interest rates.\n\nDuring an appearance in the Oval Office on Thursday to sign several new executive orders, Trump said he knew rates \u201cmuch better\u201d than the Fed, and he would like to see them come down \u201ca lot\u201d.\n\nThe US central bank is widely expected to hold its benchmark rate between 4.25-4.5 per cent next week, marking a pause after three consecutive cuts since September.\n\nThe Fed has signalled a slower pace of cuts this year with some officials concerned that\u00a0Trump\u2019s plan to raise tariffs, slash taxes and crack down on immigration will hinder efforts to beat back inflation to 2 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe concerns [at the Fed] are not just about tariffs, but also a recognition that fiscal policy is not going to help bring inflation down,\u201d said Mahmood Pradhan, economist at Amundi.\n\nBut the Fed\u2019s more cautious posture puts it on a collision course with the new US president.\n\nTrump on Thursday said he expected the Fed to listen to his demands and would speak to Powell \u201cat the right time\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think I know interest rates much better than they do, and I think I know them certainly much better than the one who\u2019s primarily in charge of making that decision,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0\u201cIf I disagree, I will let it be known.\u201d\n\nTrump elevated Powell to Fed chair during his first term in office, but was often critical of him, especially for not cutting rates quickly enough in 2019. The president indicated on the campaign trail last year that he would not try to remove Powell from his position before his term expires in 2026.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed continue to keep rates where they are and he thinks that it would be great to get a boost out of lower rates, then there\u2019s a real chance of conflict,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a centre-right policy institute.\n\nSome economists have said that if Trump\u2019s policies push up prices it could compel the Fed to hold back from further cuts or even raise borrowing costs.\n\n\u201cIf the administration do stuff that really starts to push up the rate of inflation, the Fed mandate is quite clear \u2014 they will push up rates. And they will get it in the neck [from Trump] if they do,\u201d said Mark Blyth, economics professor at Brown University.\n\nTrump used a speech to executives in Davos earlier on Thursday to say he wanted rates to come down \u201call over the world\u201d \u2014 and told the Opec cartel to bring down oil prices to make that happen.\n\nHe touched on the theme again in his Oval Office remarks to reporters a few hours later.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see oil prices come down, and when the energy comes down, that\u2019s going to knock out a lot of the inflation. That\u2019s going to automatically bring the interest rates down,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe also on Thursday raised new doubts about Washington\u2019s commitment to Nato and called for more defence spending by the US\u2019s allies in the treaty.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not protecting us,\u201d he said of the Nato countries. \u201cWe\u2019re protecting them. So I don\u2019t think we should be spending, I\u2019m not sure we should be spending anything, but we should certainly be helping them. But they should up their 2 per cent [of GDP on defence spending] to 5 per cent.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Nato comments came a day after newly sworn in secretary of state Marco Rubio \u201creaffirmed the US commitment\u201d to the group, according to a record of his conversation with the alliance\u2019s secretary-general Mark Rutte.\n\nAmong the other executive orders Trump signed on Thursday was one creating a national cryptocurrency stockpile and another to authorise the release of federal files on the assassinations of president John F Kennedy, ex-attorney-general Robert F Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve transparency and truth\u201d about the killings, said Trump. \u201cA lot of people are waiting for this for years, for decades, and everything will be revealed.\u201d\n\n", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8b80a0fd-d0a7-4cae-9f7a-f006928f790a"}}, {"id": "95220395-fe1e-4ebb-babe-5748ac53fab8", "event_name": "Donald Trump to put Steve Witkoff in charge of Iran file, officials say", "blurb": "Middle East envoy expected to take lead in addressing US concerns over Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme ", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Donald Trump is to put his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff in charge of addressing Washington\u2019s concerns over Iran, suggesting the US president is willing to test diplomacy before increasing the pressure on Tehran, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nWitkoff, a real estate investor who played a pivotal role in securing the Gaza ceasefire, was expected to spearhead efforts on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme as part of a broader remit by the president to \u201cstop the wars\u201d in the region, the people said.\n\nTrump in 2018 pulled the US out of Iran\u2019s nuclear accord with world powers, then imposed stringent sanctions and warned that it would be \u201cthe official end of Iran\u201d if it fought Washington and pursued nuclear weapons.\n\nDuring the transition to his new administration, Trump\u2019s team drew up possible measures to reinstate his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on Iran, through fresh sanctions or stricter policing of current measures.\n\nBut Trump and his aides have telegraphed in early meetings that they want to keep open a path to avoiding a broader confrontation with Iran.\n\nSome administration officials have told foreign diplomats and colleagues that they expect Witkoff to lead efforts to see whether a diplomatic accommodation is possible. Asked after this report was first published if he would put Witkoff in charge of Iran policy, the president said on Thursday: \u201cHe\u2019s certainly\u00a0someone I would use. He\u2019s done a fantastic job\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Steve has a wonderful way about him.\u201d\n\nTrump also said on Thursday afternoon that he would look to do a deal with Iran. When asked if he would support Israel striking Iran\u2019s nuclear\u00a0facilities, he said: \u201cIt would really be nice if that could be worked out without having to go that further step.\u201d\u00a0He added: \u201cIran hopefully, will make a deal.\u201d\n\nVarious presidents have elevated senior officials to negotiate with Iran after George W Bush began diplomatic efforts on Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme. It is unusual for a special envoy to take on responsibility for both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Washington\u2019s relations with Iran.\n\nWitkoff\u2019s principal focus will remain the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire. Trump has also picked Morgan Ortagus, a state department spokesperson in his first term with experience serving in the Middle East, to be Witkoff\u2019s deputy.\n\nUS officials say the full outlines of Trump\u2019s approach to Tehran, and Witkoff\u2019s remit, remain in flux. But some of the president\u2019s recent appointments have established a camp in the administration that would consider negotiating with Iran and is sceptical of a strike on its nuclear programme, which Iran hawks in both the US and Israeli governments have advocated.\n\nMichael DiMino, Trump\u2019s new top Middle East official at the Pentagon, was a former CIA official who advocated restraint in dealing with Tehran at a think-tank funded by the libertarian Koch family. Elbridge Colby, Trump\u2019s nominee for under-secretary of defence for policy, has cautioned against any military action against Iran.\n\nOthers in Trump\u2019s foreign policy team have taken a more hawkish approach, including national security adviser Mike Waltz and secretary of state Marco Rubio. During his confirmation hearing Rubio said he supported \u201cany arrangement that allows us to have safety and stability in the region but one in which we\u2019re clear-eyed\u201d.\n\nAsked about Witkoff\u2019s role, and the administration\u2019s approach, to Iran, Trump National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said: \u201cWe have no announcements to share at this time.\u201d\n\nWestern officials believe Iran is at its weakest point in decades after Israel\u2019s multifront war in the Middle East left Hamas and Hizbollah significantly diminished. Israel and the US claim a retaliatory attack on Iran last year took out much of its air defences \u2014 although this has been denied by Tehran.\n\nThe Islamic republic has also signalled it is open to talks, though analysts say it will be a significant challenge for Trump and Iran to agree to terms that would make a deal possible. The UN warned in December that Iran had taken steps to \u201cdramatically\u201d increase its stockpile of uranium enriched close to weapons grade.\n\nTrump in 2018 withdrew the US from a nuclear deal between six world powers and Iran. Britain, France and Germany are keen to reach a co-ordinated approach with the US on what to do when that deal in effect expires in October, according to diplomats.\n\nIran\u2019s vice-president for strategic affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif said in Davos this week that he hoped Trump would be \u201cmore serious, more focused, more realistic\u201d in his dealings with Iran.\n\nHe said the US withdrawal from the Iran deal had failed to \u201cdissuade\u201d Iran, but acknowledged the heavy economic costs on the Iranian people and government. Asked whether Iran would consider a deal that required the country to stop supporting regional proxy groups, he said: \u201cWe never had proxies.\u201d\n\nWitkoff\u2019s potential stewardship of Iran issues has alarmed some Iran hawks in Congress and elsewhere in Washington, who worry he will be too quick to drop pressure on Iran in seeking a possible deal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s already lifting pressure on Hamas, Hizbollah and Iran, and in the process abandoning American hostages and endangering Israel,\u201d said a senior Republican Congressional staffer. \u201cHe keeps saying he knows what Trump wants, but he doesn\u2019t understand what Trump believes.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Bita Ghaffari in Tehran", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/62e44630-6dd3-41b7-8b7c-1807a8593dde"}}, {"id": "78669b07-96ad-48a6-ba1c-d55a6a2a3278", "event_name": "Boeing books charges and warns on revenue and profit ", "blurb": "Aerospace group cites $2.8bn hit from last year\u2019s strike, lay-offs and rising defence business costs", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Boeing said it would report a much bigger fourth-quarter loss than Wall Street anticipated as it took $2.8bn in charges stemming from a six-week-long strike, higher costs in its defence business and cuts to its workforce.\n\nThe plane maker said it lost $5.46 per share between October and December while revenue was $15.2bn.

The new settlement was agreed with more than a dozen US states and other individuals who had filed lawsuits against the company. As part of the agreement, the Sackler family will pay $6.5bn over the next 15 years, while Purdue will pay $900mn.\n\nYet while attorneys-general across the country touted the headline multibillion-dollar figure of the deal\u2019s potential disbursements, the full details of how the payouts will be structured are unknown.

Without that document, questions also remain about how much of the $7.4bn will be dispersed to victims and recovery programmes.\n\nUntil recently, one member of the Sackler family had not signed on to the settlement. But in a court filing on Monday, mediator Shelley Chapman wrote the member had finally been brought onside, laying the groundwork for \u201cvarious other significant aspects of the mediation to progress\u201d.\n\nThe drugmaker initially filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in a New York federal court to manage the lawsuits over its role in the opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cFamilies throughout New York and across the nation are suffering from the immense pain and loss wrought by the opioid crisis,\u201d New York attorney-general Letitia James, one of the officials who helped broker the deal, said on Thursday. \u201cWhile no amount of money will ever fully repair the damage they caused, this massive influx of funds will bring resources to communities in need so that we can heal.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, Purdue reached an $8bn settlement with the Department of Justice in which the company plead guilty to three federal felony charges. As part of the settlement, the company admitted marketing OxyContin to healthcare workers suspected of diverting opioids, giving doctors kickbacks to write more prescriptions and coaxing them to write prescriptions for illegitimate reasons.\n\nThe latest Purdue settlement is one of the biggest potential payouts to emerge from the US opioid crisis, which has led to more than 600,000 deaths since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly 140,000 personal injury victims could benefit from the deal, according to court filings.\n\nThe US Supreme Court last summer struck down a previous $6bn deal agreed between the Sackler family and creditors, which was largely negotiated during the pandemic. The agreement relied on shielding family members from future lawsuits, which the high court said was impermissible without the family members filing for bankruptcy themselves.\n\n\u201cWhat the Sacklers want \u2014 what anybody wants when you settle something \u2014 is to be done with it,\u201d said Bruce Markell, a law professor at Northwestern University, referring to protection from future liabilities. \u201cA lot of Sacklers benefited from this. There were kids who were born after Purdue filed for bankruptcy who are probably still benefiting from the largesse.\u201d\n\nThe new deal is structured so that the Sacklers are not given automatic protection from liabilities, but victims will need to agree to not pursue further legal action in order to receive a payout, according to the New York attorney-general office.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision had left lawyers and companies trying to decide how to resolve so-called \u201cmass torts\u201d, where corporate product liability claims totalled in the thousands of victims and hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.\n\nThe funds committed by the Sacklers and Purdue will be used over the next 15 years to fund opioid addiction treatment and recovery programmes, Texas\u2019s attorney-general\u2019s office said.

Earlier this week, it said the lawsuits were part of the \u201cleft\u2019s resistance\u201d and the administration would face them in court.\n\nThe DoJ in a filing on Wednesday said the order was \u201can integral part of President Trump\u2019s recent actions, pursuant to his significant authority in the immigration field, to address this nation\u2019s broken immigration system and the ongoing crisis at the southern border\u201d.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/98681156-9d52-4221-9342-f0c37329e790"}}, {"id": "6587fd17-16d4-4444-ab8e-6059c5495b06", "event_name": "Donald Trump calls on Opec to push down global oil prices", "blurb": "US president tells World Economic Forum he will insist central banks lower interest rates \u2018immediately\u2019 afterwards", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Donald Trump has called on Opec to push down global oil prices and insisted that central banks around the world lower interest rates \u201cimmediately\u201d afterwards.\n\nIn a speech to executives in Davos on Thursday, the US president urged Saudi Arabia and other producers to lower the cost of crude oil, expressing dismay that they had not done so already.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask Saudi Arabia and Opec to bring down the cost of oil. You gotta bring it down. Which frankly I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t do before the election,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cRight now the price is high enough that that war will continue,\u201d he said, referring to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and suggesting that the elevated oil price was helping to sustain Vladimir Putin\u2019s war machine.\n\n\u201cYou gotta bring down the oil price, that will end that war. You could end that war,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump said that with the crude price lowered, he would \u201cdemand that interest rates drop immediately. And likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us.\u201d\n\nThe US president\u2019s appearance via video at the World Economic Forum marked his first address to a global audience since his inauguration earlier this week.\n\nHe used the speech to insist that companies around the world manufacture their\u00a0products in the US \u2014 or face sweeping tariffs on imported\u00a0goods entering the American market.\n\nTrump touted his economic agenda of radical deregulation and his plan to implement the \u201clargest tax cut in American history\u201d, calling it \u201cnothing less than a revolution of common sense\u201d.\n\nHis comments on the oil price came after he spoke to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Wednesday. During the conversation, Bin Salman pledged to invest as much as $600bn in the US over the next four years.\n\nBut on Thursday, Trump said he would be asking \u201cthe Crown Prince, who\u2019s a fantastic guy, to round it out to around $1tn\u201d.\n\nThe price of Brent crude fell by 1 per cent following Trump\u2019s comments, to just over $78 a barrel. A prolonged drop in oil prices could compromise Riyadh\u2019s ability to fund more investment in the US and would make it more difficult for American drillers to increase crude supply as quickly as Trump wants.\n\nThe US president also touted the merits of \u201cgood, clean, coal\u201d to power data centres needed for artificial intelligence. \u201cWe need double\u00a0the energy we currently have in the US, for AI to be as big as we want to have it,\u201d Trump said, adding that he would use emergency decrees to speed the construction of new power plants.\n\n\u201cNothing can destroy coal \u2014 not the weather, not a bomb, nothing,\u201d he said. The share price of Peabody, the largest US coal company, jumped 4 per cent on the remarks.\n\nTrump also spoke positively about his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, blaming his predecessor Joe Biden for the strained ties between Washington and Beijing and expressing hope that China could help end the war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cAll we want is fairness,\u201d Trump said, adding that he was seeking a level playing field with China. As things stood, the relationship was \u201cunfair\u201d he added.\n\nTrump also lashed out at the EU, describing fines levelled by Brussels against US tech companies for breaching competition rules as a \u201cform of taxation\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey are\u00a0American companies and they should not be doing that as far as I am concerned,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt is a form of taxation.

For two decades, the city had ridden the tailwind of the success of the tech industry, but high taxes, expensive housing and burdensome regulations for businesses have been compounded by the blows from the coronavirus pandemic and a fentanyl crisis.\n\nRemote working and fleeing businesses have meant more than a third of offices are empty, the highest of any major US city; retailers and hotels have suffered from the drop in worker footfall and tourism; homelessness and drug overdose deaths reached record levels in recent years and have overwhelmed some neighbourhoods with petty crime and drug markets.\n\nLurie campaigned on a \u201ccommon sense\u201d plan to turn that all around. The rhetoric is optimistic, but some doubt whether he can succeed where many of his predecessors have failed, particularly as this is his first role in public office. The 47-year-old founded anti-poverty charity Tipping Point Community in 2005 and has run it since then. Through his stepfather Peter Haas, the great-grandnephew of Levi Strauss, Lurie is an heir to the fortune of one of the wealthiest families in San Francisco.\n\nHis mayoral campaign pitched him as an outsider to the city\u2019s political establishment, which has faced criticism for excessive bureaucracy and corruption. Perhaps more effective was that he drastically outspent his rivals, including incumbent London Breed, putting nearly $9mn of his own money into his campaign and receiving a $1mn donation from his mother, Mimi Haas.\n\nIn his first speech as mayor, Lurie pledged to end unsheltered homelessness within six months and revitalise San Francisco\u2019s economy and reputation. First, he wants to combat the fentanyl crisis that has contributed to more deaths from overdoses than Covid-19 in the city since 2020, arguing that it is the only way to bring back workers and businesses. He has published a package of ordinances allowing private donations to fund shelter beds and cutting red tape to improve policing resources.\n\nLike President Donald Trump, Lurie has sought allies among wealthy tech executives. He appointed Sam Altman, co-founder and chief executive of OpenAI, and former Twitter chief financial officer Ned Segal as advisers to his transition team. He must use these connections to persuade industry leaders to bring more tech workers back into the city.\n\nThe frenzy in artificial intelligence has already gone some way towards reviving San Francisco\u2019s tech scene, and the opportunity it presents for the city is vast. OpenAI has quickly grown to one of the largest occupiers of commercial real estate, increasing its floor space as traditional tech companies have cut back, now leasing as much office space as Salesforce, the city\u2019s largest private employer. OpenAI\u2019s investment in the city means San Francisco is the undeniable centre of the AI world, attracting the best global talent. Other AI start-ups have followed in its wake.\n\nBut Altman, like other start-up founders in the city, has been lobbying for tax breaks. The question for Lurie is whether the potential benefits of continuing to cosy up to AI groups outweigh the risk of lost tax revenues in the short-term. San Francisco is facing a precarious financial situation. It is suffering from a predicted budget deficit of $800mn over the next two years as expenses have soared and revenues have slumped, particularly the money the city collects on transactions from its hard-hit commercial property market.\n\nThat crisis will deepen if Trump follows through on threats to withhold federal funds from \u201csanctuary\u201d cities, which limit co-operation with Washington DC\u2019s immigration policies. San Francisco, with its reputation as a bastion of progressive ideals, is an easy target.\n\nFor now, there are glimmers of hope. Tourism is still below 2019 levels but numbers are recovering, with 23.9mn visitors predicted this year. Accidental overdose deaths are at a five-year low, and both property crime and violent crime rates dropped last year to numbers not seen since 2001. How far the recovery goes, like San Francisco\u2019s fortunes in the last two decades, will be closely linked to how the tech industry, and AI, evolves.\n\ntabby.kinder@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/967d10a2-2fca-4b60-9794-2bf41a374f07"}}, {"id": "4b19e9ef-152c-438d-804d-d4bd2f7f643d", "event_name": "Saudi Arabia aims to invest $600bn in US, crown prince tells Donald Trump  ", "blurb": "Call between Mohammed bin Salman and US president comes as kingdom seeks to deepen ties with western ally  ", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Saudi Arabia aimed to invest at least $600bn in the US over the next four years, as the kingdom sought to deepen ties with its most important western ally after the return of Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nThe prince said in a Thursday phone call to congratulate Trump on his inauguration that the new US administration\u2019s proposed reforms would \u201ccreate unprecedented economic prosperity and opportunity\u201d, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe White House did not immediately provide a summary of the call. Secretary of state Marco Rubio and Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto leader \u2014 often known by his initials MBS \u2014 also spoke on the phone to discuss developments in the Middle East, the state department said on Wednesday.\n\nTrump said on Monday that he would consider making Saudi Arabia his first foreign trip as president again if Riyadh agreed to buy $500bn worth of US products, as he claimed the kingdom did in his first stint in power.\n\n\u201cI did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450bn worth of our products,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after his inauguration. \u201cIf Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450bn or $500bn \u2014 we\u2019ll up it for all the inflation \u2014 I think I\u2019d probably go.\u201d\n\nWhen he took office for his first term in 2017, Trump departed from tradition by making Saudi Arabia his first overseas destination as he attended a summit of Arab and Muslim leaders in Riyadh. Newly elected US presidents typically visit neighbouring Canada or Mexico first.\n\nThe statement about the call between Prince Mohammed and Trump did not provide details on the sectors or industries that would receive the $600bn of investment, but it said the amount could go \u201cpotentially beyond that if additional opportunities arise\u201d.\n\nIt is unclear how much of that the $450bn repeatedly touted by Trump materialised in the form of deals and trade between the two countries during the president\u2019s first term.\n\nThe $600bn investment pledge represents more than half of Saudi GDP, according to official figures, and comes as pressure grows on the kingdom\u2019s budget due to softened oil prices and a widening deficit. The announcement follows comments by officials last year that Saudi Arabia would further scale back its overseas investment and shift focus towards delivering a series of mega projects, including tourist resorts and a futuristic city in the country\u2019s north-west.\n\nSaudi Arabia is also facing a daunting set of deadlines to build infrastructure for events including the Asian Winter Games in 2029, Expo 2030 and the 2034 World Cup.\n\nTrump maintained close ties with Saudi Arabia during his first term, while the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund invested billions of dollars in companies run by Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and former Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin shortly after Trump left the White House.\n\nThe Trump Organization also signed deals to license Trump\u2019s brand for real estate developments in Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Gulf.\n\nRubio and Prince Mohammed discussed Gaza, Lebanon and Syria, as well as the threat posed by Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s main regional rival.\n\nIsraeli strikes on the Islamic republic in October hit a host of Iranian military facilities, including missile factories and air defence systems.\n\nThe military capabilities of Iran\u2019s so-called axis of resistance, including proxies and allies such as Lebanon\u2019s Hizbollah and Gaza-based Hamas, have also been severely degraded after 15 months of conflict with Israel. Islamist rebels in Syria last month also overthrew the regime of former president Bashar al-Assad, another Tehran ally.\n\nTrump said on Monday that he expected Saudi Arabia to eventually normalise ties with Israel and join the Abraham Accords, an initiative agreed during his first term that normalised relations between Israel and several Arab states including the United Arab Emirates.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/cf49bdec-7e54-46ab-a707-f788d5dfd7c7"}}, {"id": "e08286b8-cf65-4ab6-a840-de33400d0f40", "event_name": "Trump and the troublesome priest", "blurb": "The president complained about the bishop\u2019s mixing of religion and politics but in his version of Christianity the two are intertwined", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Donald Trump says he was \u201csaved by God to make America great again\u201d. Yet the best rebuttal to his presidency so far has come from a priest \u2014 the Episcopal bishop of Washington.\n\nThe Rt Rev Mariann Budde\u2019s sermon on Tuesday went where business leaders and even Democratic politicians have struggled to go. While Trump sat a few metres away in the congregation, she asked him to show mercy to gay, lesbian and transgender people and to immigrants who are \u201cscared\u201d by his policies.\n\n\u201cOur God teaches us that we are to be merciful to the stranger, for we were all once strangers in this land,\u201d Budde said at the service. It wasn\u2019t a fleeting rebuke to Trumpism; it was an eloquent 15-minute argument for a different politics.\n\nTrump sat there, fidgeting then fuming in the National Cathedral. His vice-president JD Vance, a Catholic, dissented by whispering to his wife. Perhaps they weren\u2019t expecting it. Because at the inauguration the previous day, they were given a very different religious reception.\n\nPreachers described Trump\u2019s return as a \u201cmiracle\u201d. One pastor, Lorenzo Sewell, invoked Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech in his honour.\n\nIn 2023, the charismatic Sewell was locked out of his Detroit church because its constitution had been changed and he was able to disenfranchise rank-and-file members. Shortly after the inauguration, he launched a crypto token, telling X users: \u201cI need you to go buy the official Lorenzo Sewell coin.\u201d The currency\u2019s price then quickly plunged more than 90 per cent.\n\nWho represents the Christian view of Trump? Is it Sewell with his pro-Trump, pro-prosperity talk of self-reliance, or the liberal Budde, who wants to speak for the marginalised? And, if Christianity can encompass both outcomes, is it much use for understanding and confronting Trump?\n\nBudde backed up her address with references in the Bible. She is in line with Pope Francis, who has criticised Trump\u2019s planned mass deportations of immigrants as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d.\n\nIn contrast, pro-Trump spirituality often seems to rely on taking words from their context. Sewell stripped King\u2019s dream of its intended meaning. (As for Sewell\u2019s oratory, let me just say: the phrase \u201cFree at last\u201d is not meant to sum up what the audience feels when you stop talking.)\n\nOr take the conflation of Christianity and growth. Another conservative speaker at the inauguration, Rabbi Ari Berman, suggested that George Washington had called faith and morality indispensable to \u201cAmerican prosperity\u201d. In fact, Washington said they were essential to \u201cpolitical prosperity\u201d. The context, back in 1796, was an appeal for national unity, and a warning not to trust in \u201cthe absolute power of an individual\u201d. Trump would have fidgeted through that speech, too.\n\nBut pro-Trump pastors are accepted as a valid part of the church like any other. And the pews are with the president, too. According to Michael Emerson, a researcher on religion, practising Christians are now heavily Republican, because liberal Protestants and Catholics have disproportionately stopped going to church.\n\nLast year Trump won around 60 per cent of the Christian vote, and more than 80 per cent of white evangelicals. He paid hush money to a porn star, has pledged to veto any federal abortion ban and he did not seem to place his hand on the Bible at the inauguration. But some white evangelicals see him as a useful vessel, someone who will allow them to steer the conversation.\n\nIronically, having invoked God multiple times in his inaugural address, Trump complained that Budde\u2019s sermon had mixed politics and religion. One thing Sewell and Budde agree on is that you can\u2019t keep politics out of Christianity. If the church decides simply to bless whoever is in power, it ends up compromised.\n\nThe question becomes: is religion downstream from politics? Will Trump\u2019s supporters simply retrofit their faith on to their preferred politics, and his opponents do the opposite? The answer is probably: mostly, but not always. Surely there\u2019s no point in listening to a preacher if you don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever change your mind.\n\n\u201cWhen we know what is true, it\u2019s incumbent upon us to speak the truth even when, especially when, it costs us,\u201d Budde said. Her achievement shouldn\u2019t be measured in how many people attend her next service. It should be measured in how many other people feel a duty to speak out against what they know is wrong.\n\nhenry.mance@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6860dbe6-d56a-4d64-9c8a-53c03d414525"}}, {"id": "0a6f41db-ed10-4c89-bafb-92a82a181dd3", "event_name": "Trump\u2019s Panama Canal threat revives memories of 1989 US invasion", "blurb": "Panamanians fear Washington\u2019s retaliation over Chinese interests in strategic waterway   ", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "In the Panama City neighbourhood of El Chorrillo, a neglected monument to the hundreds of Panamanians who perished during the 1989 US invasion offers a chilling reminder of what can happen if the Central American country falls foul of Washington.\n\nWith US President Donald Trump this week threatening to \u201ctake back\u201d the Panama Canal, residents who survived the battles 35 years ago are angry that they are once again at the whim of their country\u2019s main ally.\n\n\u201cTrump should respect the Panamanian flag, just as we respect that of the United States,\u201d said Isaias Blades, a street vendor who as a child sheltered from US military helicopters. \u201cIn 1989 we had to walk beneath gunfire, as tanks rolled around us\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009once again the US wants to dominate Latin America.\u201d\n\nThe invasion overthrew the military dictatorship of General Manuel Noriega, who was captured, flown to the US and jailed on drug trafficking charges. Panama has been a democracy and staunch US ally ever since.\n\nBut the spectre of fresh US intervention in Panama has been revived by Trump, who has said that the country\u2019s famous canal \u2014 which was completed in 1914 and controlled wholly or jointly by the US until its full handover to Panama in 1999 \u2014 should now be returned to Washington.\n\n\u201cWe have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made and Panama\u2019s promise to us has been broken,\u201d Trump said during his inaugural address on Monday, claiming that China \u201cis operating\u201d the canal. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t give it to China, we gave it to Panama and we are taking it back!\u201d\n\nThe Panama Canal, an 82km system of waterways and three-lane locks that connect the Caribbean to the Pacific, binds Panama to the global economy, with 5 per cent of world maritime trade, worth about $270bn, passing through it on as many as 13,000 individual crossings a year. More than 70 per cent of that traffic originates from, or is destined for, a US port.\n\nChina\u2019s growing investment in Panama \u2014 including ports at either end of the canal operated by Hutchison Ports, an arm of Hong Kong-listed conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings \u2014 has raised hackles in Washington.\n\nAfter Panama switched recognition from Taiwan to China in 2017, Beijing built a big convention centre in the Central American nation and is constructing a fourth bridge across the canal. It is now Panama\u2019s second-biggest investor, after the US.\n\nTrump has complained about US ships being \u201cripped off\u201d with high fees for transiting the canal, though a neutrality treaty signed as part of the canal handover accords originally negotiated by President Jimmy Carter in 1977 obliges Panama to treat all countries equally on tariffs, making it difficult to offer the US a special deal.\n\nIlya Espino de Marotta, the deputy administrator of the Panama Canal, said China has no influence on the waterway, and that any contracts awarded to Chinese companies were done so transparently.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s run 100 per cent by Panamanians,\u201d she said in an interview in her office overlooking the canal. \u201cAnd we are neutral towards all countries\u201d.\n\nPanama\u2019s government ordered an \u201cexhaustive\u201d audit of Hutchison\u2019s operations on Monday, shortly after Trump\u2019s inaugural address. The company first won its port concessions in Panama in 1997, but they were renewed in 2021 and now run to 2047.\n\nTrump\u2019s concern with the Panama Canal dates back to his first administration. When he met then-Panamanian president Juan Carlos Varela at the White House in 2017, his public comments were complimentary.\n\nBut in a private conversation Trump raised the issue of canal tariffs and ownership and expressed his dissatisfaction with the arrangement, according to people familiar with the meeting.\n\nFew believe that the president is serious about a military invasion of Panama to seize back the canal. But if he were to order in troops, the country, with a population of just 4.5mn, has no army and little experience of fighting wars.\n\n\u201cWe are worried,\u201d said a senior Panamanian official, speaking off the record. \u201cWe think there could be some kind of retaliation if Trump doesn\u2019t get what he wants. So let\u2019s see what might be on the table for negotiation.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the handover treaty, US military vessels have priority to cross the canal, though, like all other ships, they have to pay tolls.\n\nAn invasion would also test the US. The military\u2019s Southern Command, covering Latin America and the Caribbean, moved from Panama to Miami in 1997 and Washington closed its extensive air force, naval and army facilities in the Central American nation in 1999. The air base has since been repurposed into a business park, while Washington\u2019s only nearby military facility is an anti-drug base in Honduras.\n\nBut the biggest damage would be diplomatic and political. Panama has remained one of Washington\u2019s closest allies in the region and has elected right-of-centre, pro-business governments, such as its current leader, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino.\n\nPanama uses the US dollar as its currency, is popular with US companies as a logistics base and is sought after by retired Americans. Baseball is preferred over football, and US-style malls line the multilane highways around the capital.\n\nA Panamanian businessman with interests in the US said that while Chinese investment had grown, most businesses preferred to make deals with American companies. \u201cIt\u2019s night and day between the Americans and the Chinese \u2014 culturally and in business,\u201d he said.\n\nGen Laura Richardson, who stepped down as commander of SouthCom last November, has been outspoken about the growing threat she says is posed by Chinese investment in Latin America. \u201cStrategic competition matters,\u201d Richardson told the FT last year. \u201cWe have to be investing and we have to be competing on critical infrastructure projects for\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009like-minded democracies\u201d.\n\nThe US State Department confirmed on Thursday that secretary of state Marco Rubio will travel to Panama next week.\n\nRyan Berg, a Latin America expert at the CSIS think-tank in Washington, said he \u201ckeeps going back and forth\u201d over whether Trump\u2019s military threat was serious or whether \u201che would say \u2018yes\u2019 if the US were to get contracts to operate the ports\u201d currently run by Hutchison.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s about Chinese influence, then having US companies operating the ports would solve a lot of the issues,\u201d Berg said, pointing to US concerns about Beijing using the Hutchison concessions for spying on shipping or as a way to block the canal in the event of hostilities occurring over, say, Taiwan.\n\nJorge Eduardo Ritter, who served as Panama\u2019s foreign minister and its first minister of the canal, said Beijing was filling a space that Washington had neglected. \u201cAfter the cold war, the US stopped paying attention to what it considers its own backyard,\u201d Ritter told the FT. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when China came in.\u201d\n\nData visualisation by Alan Smith and cartography by Steven Bernard", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/949b8d11-d2e9-464a-a5e8-be17677b6fd9"}}, {"id": "85946c2e-01e0-477d-9e9b-a155d3038b35", "event_name": "Will Trump\u2019s fight against the \u2018deep state\u2019 upend government?", "blurb": "Also in today\u2019s newsletter, why the first few days of Trump\u2019s presidency have left China cautiously optimistic ", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning and welcome to White House Watch. Steff will be back in the saddle on Tuesday. For now, let\u2019s dive into:\n\nDonald Trump has wasted no time in bringing his campaign of vengeance to the Oval Office.\n\nOn day one he stripped security clearances from perceived foes and granted temporary clearances to those he deemed \u201cqualified and trusted\u201d. He ordered the removal of security detail assigned to John Bolton \u2014 his former national security adviser-turned-foe \u2014\u00a0after threats on his life in 2019, and got rid of a Pentagon portrait of retired General Mark Milley, his former top military adviser who became an arch-critic.\n\nThis may just be the beginning.\n\n\u201cNever again will the immense power of the state be weaponised to persecute political opponents,\u201d Trump said in his inaugural address. Hours later he authorised sweeping reviews of US intelligence and other agencies to correct \u201cpast misconduct\u201d.\u201cOrdinarily there may be nothing wrong with retrospective investigations into potential government wrongdoing,\u201d said Ryan Goodman, professor at the New York University School of Law. However, Goodman added that Trump\u2019s pre-existing list of enemies made these actions quite troublesome.\n\nIt may still be \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d whether Trump is sending a message for civil servants to \u201cstay out of the way\u201d of his radical agenda or \u201cto rearrange the bureaucracy so that it\u2019s more completely at the service of the president\u201d, according to Yuval Levin, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But it\u2019s clear that intelligence agencies are a particular focus.\n\nKash Patel, Trump\u2019s controversial pick to head the FBI, has long argued for the removal of security clearances to eradicate the \u201cdeep state\u201d.This could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d across the government, a former US intelligence official said. \u201cThis is a clear sign that Trump will use clearances for political reasons. That will make people wary to speak their minds,\u201d the person added.Trump\u2019s plans go far beyond America\u2019s security apparatus. The executive order on \u201cweaponisation\u201d called for scrutiny of agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and justice department.\n\nThe view from China on Trump\u2019s second presidency is: so far, so good.\n\nWhile Trump did order an investigation into US-China trade and threatened a 10 per cent tariff related to fentanyl, that\u2019s small potatoes compared with earlier claims that he would immediately impose 60 per cent tariffs. It\u2019s also less severe than the 25 per cent tariffs he vowed to impose on Mexico and Canada.\n\nTrump gave China further hope that he would hold his punches against the world\u2019s second-largest economy when he hinted at a potential deal linking tariffs to ownership of TikTok. \u201cThere is a possibility that the two sides can strike a deal \u2014 you can sense there is cautious optimism,\u201d said Zhao Minghao, professor at the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cBut we will need to see if there is a good match between what Trump and Beijing can offer each other.\u201dEconomists, however, warned that it\u2019s too early to say whether an outright trade war can be averted. After all, the Trump administration is filled with China hawks (notably, secretary of state Marco Rubio, who has long been tough on China, was the first cabinet member to be confirmed). \u201cThis is more of a holding pattern for now,\u201d said Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC. \u201cIt is somewhat encouraging\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009But I think it would be the wrong conclusion to say that China is now entirely off the hook.\u201d\n\nWhat questions do you have about Trump\u2019s trade agenda?

The new US president has jeopardised more than $300bn in federal funds for green energy and infrastructure projects after his decision to pause disbursements from Joe Biden\u2019s industrial policies. What\u2019s most vulnerable are loan requests or commitments that have yet to be finalised to cleantech companies under the Department of Energy\u2019s Loan Programs Office, the country\u2019s green bank, warn lawyers.\n\nThe move marks Trump\u2019s first attempts to undo Biden\u2019s economic legacy, which aimed to revitalise the country\u2019s industrial sector while slashing emissions. The financial scale of the president\u2019s pause is likely much wider as the policies also direct smaller pockets of funding to initiatives to build out hydrogen hubs, electric vehicle charging networks and clean up agricultural emissions.\u00a0There is also at least another $300bn in federal funds that will start to become available this year that are now likely to be frozen.\n\nToday\u2019s Energy Source looks at the US gas-fired power plant renaissance that is poised to take place under Trump. The president has declared a \u201cnational energy emergency\u201d to speed up the construction of energy infrastructure and vowed to unleash the country\u2019s oil and gas production. But the expected surge in domestic gas demand from the country\u2019s AI revolution may pose a threat to his international aspirations.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nAmanda\n\nThe world\u2019s largest turbine manufacturers are leaning into their gas business as Trump\u2019s mission to unleash US fossil fuel production and launch a massive AI infrastructure project create a prime opportunity for gas-fired power.\n\n\u201cThe tone this week has been very clear that the country needs particularly more dispatchable power. Gas is the best-equipped technology to be that,\u201d Scott Strazik, chief executive of GE Vernova, the largest manufacturer of gas turbines, told Energy Source.\n\nYesterday, GE Vernova reported orders for gas turbines doubled last year to 20GW, helping drive fourth-quarter revenue to record highs. Its shares are up more than 300 per cent since it began trading last year, and its rival Siemens Energy has also seen an astronomical rise in its share price.\n\nTheir performance is the latest reminder of the change in fortune for US gas as a fossil-friendly administration and soaring power demand from AI data centres and the onshoring of manufacturing fuel the hunt for cheap, around-the-clock sources of power.\n\n\u201cGas is back in vogue,\u201d said Akshat Kasliwal, a power analyst at PA Consulting. \u201cGas-powered facilities for years were in the trenches and they faced an anaemic outlook, but that\u2019s now all changing once again.\u201d\n\nAs many as 80 new gas-fired power plants will be built in the US by 2030, according to consultancy Enverus, adding 46 gigawatts of capacity \u2014 the size of the electricity system in Norway and nearly 20 per cent more than was added in the past five years.\n\nWood Mackenzie and S&P Global Market Intelligence are even more bullish, predicting US gas-fired capacity additions will be 35 per cent and 66 per cent higher, respectively, over the five years, compared with the buildout in the previous half decade. In addition to AI data centres and manufacturing, the conversion of coal plants to gas is also driving growth.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of opportunity,\u201d said Caitlin Tessin, vice-president of market innovation and Gulf Coast business development at Canadian pipeline giant Enbridge, which transports 20 per cent of US gas. The company plans to invest \u201cbillions\u201d to expand its infrastructure in the next few years.\n\nThe gas-fired power plant boom will occur under Trump, who ordered the \u201cunleashing\u201d of US fossil fuel production on his first day in office, expediting permits for energy infrastructure and promising to export more molecules abroad.\n\nUS power demand is expected to grow 16 per cent by 2029 after two decades of nearly flat growth, according to think-tank Grid Strategies. The US Department of Energy says electricity demand from data centres used for AI will triple in the next three years.\n\nNew gas-fired power plant announcements have reversed forecasts for the country\u2019s gas capacity. As recently as December 2023, surveys of facilities from the US Energy Information Administration had expected a net decrease in gas-fired generation capacity from 2025-2030, according to an analysis by BloombergNEF.\n\nSome companies are delaying retirements of gas plants or building scale through acquisitions to keep up with demand. Last year, Wood Mackenzie revised down 2035 expectations for total US gas plant retirements by 10 per cent.\n\nEarlier this month, Constellation Energy, one of the country\u2019s largest electricity providers, announced it was buying Calpine, the biggest independent power producer of gas, in a deal worth nearly $27bn.\n\nArtem Abramov, head of cleantech at Rystad Energy, warns the jump in demand for gas at home may pose a threat to Trump\u2019s calls to unleash exports abroad. The industry is poised for a boom in liquefied natural gas exports in the coming years as more terminals come online.\n\n\u201cBy the end of [Trump\u2019s] term\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the industry will realise that we don\u2019t have enough supply in the country to both keep satisfying the LNG demand from Europe and Asia and domestic demand,\u201d Abramov said. Rystad Energy revised its 2035 forecasts for US gas-fired generation up 20 per cent in the past couple of years.\n\nThe expansion of gas-fired generation adds to mounting doubts about the country\u2019s progress on decarbonisation. The Biden administration had set a target to reduce US emissions by 50-52 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade when it rejoined the Paris Agreement, which Trump pulled the country out of within minutes of entering office.\n\nUS gas-fired power plants had surpassed 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions last year, up nearly 4 per cent annually and the highest on record, according to data from Ember, an energy think-tank. None of the planned gas plants tracked by Enverus will come equipped with carbon capture systems.\u00a0(Amanda Chu)\n\nEnergy Source is written and edited by Jamie Smyth, Myles McCormick, Amanda Chu, Tom Wilson and Malcolm Moore, with support from the FT\u2019s global team of reporters.

This week, a man who took satisfaction in an insurrection against the US on his behalf became the 47th US president. His sidekick, the world\u2019s richest man, dabbled in fascist-style salutations. Apart from that, how is everyone feeling?\n\nA lot of fearful attention is being paid to what Donald Trump might do with tariffs. Rightly so; he is, after all, the self-declared \u201ctariff man\u201d (on which, do listen to Alan Beattie\u2019s podcast interview with tariff guru Doug Irwin). But there is a risk of being all-consumed by trade policy when there are many other economic challenges on the way.\n\nAlready, Trump has fired a few shots across the world\u2019s bows concerning economic matters that were hardly debated in the months before his return to the White House. By executive order, he has jettisoned (the US\u2019s participation in) the global deal on multinational corporate taxation that his first administration did a very good job of advancing. Too few paid attention to the signs, although his nominee for Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, railed against the deal in his appointment hearing. Trump himself now vows retaliation against countries that push ahead with taxing US multinationals\u2019 profits in their territories.\n\nAnother economic consequence for the rest of the world that has barely been thought about is that his promised crackdown on immigration could redirect large immigration flows from Latin America towards Europe, as my colleague Laura Dubois wrote about last week.\n\nSo it\u2019s overdue, I think, to survey what could come our way that we at present least expect. In short, what are the black swans of Trumponomics? Below are some of my suggestions, though I suppose once we recognise them, they are no longer strictly speaking black swans. The \u201cgrey swans\u201d of Trumponomics, perhaps? Here we go.\n\nThen there\u2019s the big one: the end of US democracy. It\u2019s hard to even begin to think about what the economic repercussions would be and, frankly, that is not the biggest thing to be concerned about. It is also in the nature of black swans that they are hard to spot or even imagine. For both reasons, my \u201cgrey swans\u201d list is necessarily incomplete.

Procter & Gamble reported a solid set of earnings yesterday, with sales up 3 per cent. An important milestone: price increases did not contribute to sales growth for the first time since 2019. In consumer goods, at least, the war on inflation feels like it has been won. Email us with other victories: robert.armstrong@ft.com and aiden.reiter@ft.com.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven tech stocks have not had a great month (a good day yesterday aside). Below is the performance of Bloomberg\u2019s Mag Seven index relative to the performance of other large-cap US stocks. The Big Techs have been underperforming since Christmas:\n\nThe Mag Seven are such a huge part of the US stock market that a change in their fortunes amounts to a change in the character of the whole market. So what is going on here? It would be most welcome if 2025, and the Trump administration, brings the broadening of US stock market returns that portfolio managers have awaited for so long.\n\nAny time we see a change in stock market dynamics, the first question to ask is whether a changing interest rate environment has something to do with it. In this case the answer to that question is interesting. Here is the relative performance of the Mag Seven going back to January 2024, plotted against the 10-year Treasury yield:\n\nSince the middle of last year, the correlation between rates and the Mag Seven has been rough, but notable. Flat or falling rates have coincided with Big Tech underperformance, rising rates with outperformance. This could be coincidental, of course, or there could be a third factor at work which affects both series. It is true there has not always been a positive relationship between rates and Big Tech performance; in fact, the very opposite relationship \u2014 falling rates helping Big Tech \u2014 was touted for a long time.\n\nThere is, however, a neat explanation for what is going on here. Higher rates reflect worries about inflationary pressures, and therefore tighter monetary policy, which in turn means slower growth. And in a slowing economy, investors want to own companies that do not depend on economic growth for revenue and profit gains. The Big Tech companies fit the bill. The Mag Seven, in other words, have become a flight-to-safety trade.\n\nReinforcing this interpretation, the sectors that have been outperforming while the Mag Seven have been underperforming are cyclicals. Over the past month, the leading industries have been energy, materials, industrials, and financials. The prospect of a US economy that is boosted by Trump tax cuts and deregulation \u2014 but, crucially, is not suffering from inflation \u2014 is catnip for all four. The worst performing industry in the past month fits this theory, too: consumer staples and food stocks, the stuff of recession investing, have performed terribly.\n\nA few weeks ago we described the market as being \u201cin suspense\u201d \u2014 with uncertainty as the dominant theme. But as cyclicals have continued to outperform the Mag Seven, that interpretation no longer looks as compelling. Growth expectations are taking hold.\n\nMore on this (suspiciously tidy) theory tomorrow.\n\nLate on Monday, Donald Trump announced he would hit Mexico and Canada with 25 per cent across-the-board tariffs by February 1. America\u2019s neighbours are its top bilateral trading partners. One might therefore expect the threat to spook the market, either by hurting specific companies or by increasing inflation expectations. But the equity market sat on its hands.\n\nThe only notable market response was in currencies. The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso had rallied Monday afternoon, when it appeared tariffs were not on the day one agenda. But they plummeted first thing on Tuesday, and have crawled back up since then:\n\nThere is a lively debate on whether or not Trump\u2019s tariffs will be inflationary for the US economy as a whole \u2014 with some good points on either side, and some evidence of inflationary fears in the bond market. Unhedged is suspending judgment on this for now. We still do not know the extent of the tariffs or how other countries, in this case Canada and Mexico, will retaliate.\n\nBut there are sure to be notable impacts, inflationary and otherwise, on specific sectors of the economy. To start, note that the US\u2019 neighbours are two of its biggest trade partners:\n\nThe tariffs will not be a huge drag on US economic growth. Our colleague Chris Giles recently pointed out the US is quite a closed economy, when compared to its developed world peers: US goods trade is only 19 per cent of GDP, versus 30 per cent for the EU, and 53 per cent for Canada. And compared to the massive size of the US economy, exports to Canada and Mexico are small: both are just over 1 per cent of GDP.\n\nIf the tariffs go through, the economic pain would be felt more in Canada and Mexico. Stephen Brown of Capital Economics notes to us that Canadian goods exports to the US are worth 20 per cent of Canada\u2019s GDP \u2014 25 per cent tariffs could cause GDP \u201cto fall by somewhere in the region of 3 per cent, triggering a recession\u201d, he says. The impact on Mexico\u2019s economy would also be large: exports to the US are 25 per cent of Mexico\u2019s GDP. \u201cThe hit on Mexico\u2019s economy would likely be severe, with a potential reduction in GDP growth by as much as two percentage points,\u201d says Andres Abadia of Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nBut some US companies and industries will be disrupted. The US is heavily dependent on Canada and Mexico in key sectors, particularly energy and minerals, cars, lumber and agriculture:\n\nThe US gets more than half of its imported oil from Canada, but oil markets should settle pretty quickly if trade walls go up. Other markets face harder adjustments. While the US has a big lumber industry and exports much of its own food, it will take time for homebuilders, retailers, nuclear power companies, and manufacturers to rejigger supply chains \u2014 especially with the threat of tariffs on other countries in the background. US carmakers have also offloaded a lot of their manufacturing to Mexico; reinvesting in US factories or finding other parts suppliers will take time, too. We\u2019ll hold off on calling the price effects all-out inflation, but transitory price shocks from 25 per cent tariffs seem like a certainty.\n\nThe stocks of the biggest homebuilders, carmakers, and grocery chains have barely moved on this news. Commodities such as oil and uranium are down. This may be evidence of the markets having already priced tariffs in, or remaining in a wait-and-see mode. But, if Trump follows through on his threats, we predict the impact extends beyond the currency markets.\n\n(Reiter)\n\nFar from home.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b0044ca5-a400-4a37-8d74-73e138c486b6"}}, {"id": "34c665e8-3230-41bd-bd9e-5c4b5feda680", "event_name": "Will Europe put \u2018boots on the ground\u2019 in Ukraine?", "blurb": "Trump presidency revives Macron\u2019s idea of sending western soldiers as deterrent against future Russian aggression", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "It is an open secret that western special forces are present in Ukraine as \u201csneakers on the ground\u201d.

At the time, it was ruled out as impracticable and too risky. But since then, Ukraine\u2019s military has struggled. The prospect of Nato membership has dwindled. Trump, seeking to disengage the US from European security, has said he wants a ceasefire \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. And Kyiv has hinted at its readiness for a deal, as long as its allies provide strong security guarantees.\n\nAs a result, on-off talks have resumed about how western troops, specifically European forces, could help sustain the ceasefire that Trump hopes to broker with Moscow. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that if Europe is serious about providing an effective deterrent, 200,000 troops will be needed, at a \u201cminimum\u201d.\n\nNot at all. That is far more than the number of troops that took part in the D-Day landings of the second world war.\n\nUkrainian officials believe that between 40,000 and 50,000 foreign troops operating as a security force across the 1,000km frontline could be feasible, according to people involved in the discussions between Kyiv and its western partners.\n\nTalks are, meanwhile, under way among European allies, with British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte expected to discuss the issue at an \u201cinformal retreat\u201d hosted by the EU on February 3.\n\nSo far, only the Baltic states have signalled support for the idea, as long as it is a broader mission with other allies. Poland has ruled out sending troops and insists that it should not be Nato\u2019s border states with Russia that are involved with troops on the ground in Ukraine.\n\nGermany\u2019s outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz was fiercely opposed to the deployment of German troops in Ukraine. Friedrich Merz, the Christian-Democratic leader likely to become chancellor after elections on February 23, has expressed support for Ukraine, but has not explicitly endorsed the idea of deploying troops.\n\nWhen Macron floated the possibility last February, the idea was that European troops could take on important support roles \u2014 such as defending critical infrastructure, training Ukrainian forces, repairing weaponry, or patrolling the Belarus border. This would allow more of Kyiv\u2019s 800,000-strong army to focus on frontline operations, where fewer than half are currently deployed.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s re-election changed the discussion. Now the focus is on how European troops might be used as a peacekeeping force, while helping to sustain Ukraine\u2019s military.\n\nThe mission would have three aims: to reassure Ukraine it has western support; deter Russia from attacking again; and show the US that Europe is committed to guaranteeing Ukraine\u2019s security. As Zelenskyy said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, if Europe failed to act decisively, the continent could slide into irrelevance. It was \u201cnot even clear\u201d, Zelenskyy said, that Europeans would have a role in any peace negotiations.\n\nFor cash-strapped European states, deploying troops may be a more feasible alternative to indefinitely providing Ukraine with billions of euros in military aid.\n\nThe force would have to be \u201crobust enough to not be a soft target that Russia could immediately test, and big enough so that it does not require immediate reinforcement and is not seen as a backdoor commitment by Nato\u201d, said Camille Grand, a former senior Nato official now at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nSuch a force could total 40,000 troops, Grand estimated, and would probably be formed under an ad-hoc coalition led by the UK, France and the Netherlands, plus contributions from the Baltic and Nordic countries.\n\nNato\u2019s role would be deliberately kept to a minimum to limit the risk of escalation with Russia. Even so, Grand suggested that under the \u201cBerlin-plus format\u201d, the EU could use Nato\u2019s strategic planning capabilities for peacekeeping operations, as in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It also allows for UK participation.\n\nYes \u2014 although this would not be a traditional peacekeeping operation like the UN\u2019s Blue Helmets, which monitor ceasefires, count shells fired and other infractions, but are not authorised to use lethal force and have to remain neutral.\n\nThe European troops would obviously be on Ukraine\u2019s side. However, they would not fight on the frontline. As such, they would form a \u201cstabilisation force\u201d or a \u201cdeterrence force\u201d rather than a fully neutral \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d force.\n\nOne model is South Korea, which has a sizeable US military presence although South Korean troops do the fighting. Another is KFOR, the Nato-led \u201cpeace support operation\u201d in Kosovo.\n\nKFOR has sustained multiple casualties from the Serbian side since it was deployed in 1999. But that has not meant Nato was \u201cat war\u201d with Serbia. A similar logic could hold with the stabilisation force in Ukraine should it face a Russian attack.\n\nPossibly not. The very notion is premised on there being a decent peace settlement with Russia that allows Ukraine to maintain sovereignty, control its territory, retain its army and remain a democracy that the west is happy to work with.\n\nRussia may never agree to that. Moscow might also break any deal it does sign, as it did when it invaded Ukraine in 2022, in breach of the Minsk agreements it signed after annexing Crimea in 2014 and 2015.\n\nEuropean allies often say their ultimate goal is to build a \u201cstronger Ukraine\u201d, which, according to one western official, would be \u201cable to continue imposing heavy costs on Russia, stop Russian troop advances, and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009sustain that for as long as necessary in terms of material, manpower and finance\u201d.\n\nBut Europe may balk at sending troops into a \u201chot war\u201d for fear of escalating the conflict with Russia. Even if European leaders do decide to send troops, their parliaments and voters may disagree. The US may also refuse to provide the logistical support that the operation would need.\n\nStill, the risks of sending in troops may pale in comparison with those of inaction. As Starmer said during his recent visit to Kyiv: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty. If Russia succeeds in its aggression, it will affect us all for a very long time.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Christopher Miller in Kyiv", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/609cfeac-1af4-4f40-a634-74d6c12e60b8"}}, {"id": "03d53ced-8b07-491a-898a-548bb9ac47ef", "event_name": "Eagles, flags and a thumbs-up: what Trump\u2019s White House website tells us", "blurb": "His revamped online presence portrays the president as part action hero, part hard-nosed CEO", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "The video that autoplays on the new White House website starts with the pulse of helicopter blades. There are flags, salutes and a lone bald eagle gliding across the sky. No one smiles \u2014 though President Donald Trump offers a manly thumbs up. In its exultation of American power it might as well be a Michael Bay blockbuster. It even comes with its own tagline: \u2018America is BACK\u2019.\n\nIf the start of the first Trump term was characterised by administrative chaos and public disdain from the liberal great and good, the second is shaping up to be far more slick. Establishment pushback has dwindled and the vision of leadership Trump wants to portray has been packaged with skill. Online he is part action hero (\u201cI will be fighting for you with every breath in my body\u201d) and part hard-nosed CEO.\n\nRevamping whitehouse.gov and removing all traces of the last occupant is now as much a presidential tradition as redecorating the White House. And it offers better insights than custom carpets and a Diet Coke button. The new site is as dark as a Trump Tower lobby while its layout is streamlined and organised. In his official portrait, the president\u2019s narrowed gaze and raised eyebrow look like a still from his reality show The Apprentice. It\u2019s a long way from the cheerful grin he sported during his first term.\n\nThe message being broadcast is that the Trump administration 2.0 has come prepared and ready for a fight. On Facebook, the official White House account claimed in a post that NOTHING WILL STAND IN OUR WAY.\n\nAlong with promises of \u201cunleashing\u201d American energy and ending inflation, some of the most telling clues are in what has disappeared. When Joe Biden became president in 2021, the website added the pronoun options \u201cthey/them\u201d to its contact form. It also scattered hidden messages in the code designed to appeal to software engineers who might want to work for the government. Francis Arnold, a professor at Caltech and co-chair of the former president\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, pointed out one that contained the line: \u201cHope over fear. Unity over division. Science over fiction. Truth over lies.\u201d\n\nThe new website has purged mentions of any pronouns other than he and she. A Spanish language translation has also gone. So have all mentions of climate change \u2014 save for Trump\u2019s promise to end the previous administration\u2019s \u201cextremism\u201d and exit the Paris Climate Accord.\n\nEverything is sleek, pared back and imperious. Via the National Archives, which preserves \u201cfrozen\u201d versions of previous White House websites, you can see how friendly Bill Clinton\u2019s taupe-coloured, bloggy-looking site was by comparison. Access for ordinary Americans was promoted, with users offered the chance to send the president \u201celectronic mail\u201d (Clinton was the first US president to send emails, though he claims to have sent only two). It also offers an explanation of the website itself for those confused about what they were looking at: \u201cusing a service on the Internet called the World Wide Web (WWW), people all over the world can locate documents.\u201d\n\nTravel forward to the George W Bush administration and the site is more austere, fitting for posts on the war on terror. It features an uplifting tribute to the character of the people of America for showing \u201ccalm in times of danger\u201d. By the 2010s, Barack Obama\u2019s sunnier version reflects improvements in digital photography and the rise of Instagram aesthetics. It is dominated by a picture of the glossy green White House lawn.\n\nThe US was one of the first countries to create government websites and is the only one that can use \u201cgov\u201d as the sole domain name. Still, according to a UN survey it ranks a lowly 19th in the list of best, most useful government sites. Top is Denmark, which welcomes visitors with the line: \u201cOnce we were brutal Vikings. Now we are one of the world\u2019s most peaceful societies.\u201d Cycling and gender equality posts take precedence. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen gets a pared back CV and little else.\n\nIn the UK, the Number 10 website is similarly modest, displaying a potted history of Sir Keir Starmer, a rather awkward prime ministerial photo and posts about his government\u2019s plans. There are no videos featuring the Red Arrows and no proud British bulldog \u2014 more\u2019s the pity. On X, the prime minister\u2019s official account has a series of dry pronouncements. It is markedly less entertaining than the unofficial outpourings of Larry, the Number 10 cat.\n\nThe rest of the world should take note of Trump\u2019s showmanship. The lesson from the latest White House website makeover is that visual messages can be just as effective as verbal ones.\n\nelaine.moore@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e9220dae-f39d-4da9-a194-6856569d7373"}}, {"id": "3f0f9044-2908-40fe-8004-a5605e82c717", "event_name": "Donald Trump\u2019s Mexico tariffs would shift plants to Asia, warns car parts maker", "blurb": "Sumitomo Electric head says president\u2019s proposed 25% duty would amount to the US \u2018strangling\u2019 itself", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on Mexico would amount to the US \u201cstrangling\u201d itself and are likely to force production to shift to south-east Asia, the head of one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of car circuitry has warned.\n\nOsamu Inoue, president of Sumitomo Electric, which makes parts for Volkswagen, Toyota and Stellantis, among others, said Trump\u2019s threatened 25 per cent tariffs on Mexican goods would do more harm to US suppliers, which account for almost a third of car parts investment in Mexico.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s strangling your own neck,\u201d he said. \u201cUp until now, many companies set up in Mexico to make things to send to the US, so if that supply chain comes apart then it will have a huge impact.\u201d\n\nMexico is the world\u2019s fourth-largest exporter of car parts, with shipments totalling $126bn and accounting for 42 per cent of the US\u2019s imports of such products.\n\nThe country specialises in labour-intensive parts such as electrical cables, airbags and motors for electric cars. US companies make up almost 30 per cent of the industry\u2019s investment in the country, according to Mexico\u2019s National Auto Parts Industry Association.\n\nJapan\u2019s Sumitomo Electric vies with Yazaki as the world\u2019s largest maker of wire harnesses, which hold together the nearly three miles of electrical cables in every car that carry instructions to steer wheels, slam brakes and open the boot. One in every four cars globally contains its wire harness.\n\nMexico has become an important production hub for Sumitomo and other wire harness makers because of its cheaper labour and proximity to the US, but Trump could cause that to unwind.\n\nThe president has threatened to introduce 25 per cent tariffs on all products from Mexico and Canada as early as February 1 unless they control the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants into the US.\n\nIf the tariffs are introduced, Sumitomo and other suppliers are likely to shift more production to south-east Asian countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines, where tariffs of 5 per cent apply to US-bound exports.\n\n\u201cEven paying tariffs, it\u2019s still cheaper to make them in Vietnam and the Philippines currently,\u201d said Inoue. \u201cIf tariffs will really be 25 per cent on Mexico and then settle at \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 10 or 20 per cent on south-east Asia, we would need to review our production accordingly.\u201d\n\nMexican trade experts and companies view the scenario of higher tariffs on its exports compared with Asia as the worst outcome, as it would lose relative competitiveness\u00a0to countries such as Vietnam.\n\nThe labour-intensive production of wire harnesses is not likely to move to the US either, added Inoue, given the high minimum wages and difficulty in retaining workers.\n\nManufacturing of the vital but obscure low-cost part shot to global prominence in 2022, when BMW and Volkswagen were forced to shut wiring factories in Ukraine because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion.\n\nInoue said that if the war ended, it would increase production in Ukraine because of rising wages in neighbouring Romania, which became an alternative alongside Morocco and Tunisia.\n\nAs well as wire harnesses, Sumitomo Electric is one of the world\u2019s top suppliers of optical fibre cables used by data centres, semiconductor materials and submarine cables to transmit power from offshore wind farms to land.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e10058e3-ffbb-4a24-9201-63e1c239ac7a"}}, {"id": "ceb0e622-bb65-4894-847c-90bfc2de0c7d", "event_name": "Federal Reserve to keep rates on hold for \u2018foreseeable future\u2019, Pimco says", "blurb": "US central bank will wait for more details of Trump\u2019s policies before resuming cuts, says bond manager\u2019s investment chief ", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "The Federal Reserve is poised to keep interest rates on hold \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d and could even boost borrowing costs, as central bankers await clarity on Donald Trump\u2019s policies, said bond fund giant Pimco.\n\nDan Ivascyn, the $2tn asset manager\u2019s chief investment officer, said he expected the US central bank to keep rates steady until there was \u201cmore clarity either on the data front or the policy front\u201d.\n\nIvascyn\u2019s remarks come as a debate swirls on Wall Street about the future of the Fed\u2019s rate-cutting cycle over concerns that if Donald Trump follows through on his plans to enact sweeping tariffs, it could fuel higher inflation at a time when the US economy has proved more resilient than expected.\n\n\u201cA lot of the policies being introduced can be very, very positive for growth [and] productivity over the long run,\u201d Ivascyn said in an interview with the Financial Times, adding that there was a \u201ctension between what may make sense over the long run, but lead to some pressures over the short term\u201d.\n\nIvascyn said that rate increases were \u201ccertainly possible\u201d, although not his baseline scenario, pointing to several recent surveys that had signalled an uptick in consumers\u2019 inflation expectations \u2014 often a leading indicator.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not out of the woods yet from an inflation perspective,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates by a full percentage point last year, but officials in December forecast just two quarter-point reductions in 2025, compared with the four that had been projected in September.\n\nFed chief Jay Powell said in December that labour market risks had diminished, while inflation was moving \u201csideways\u201d, meaning the central bank would probably take a \u201cmore cautious\u201d approach to rate cuts this year.

The threat of US tariffs on Europe compounded the worries of executives and politicians at the Swiss gathering, and they warned that a rising US economic tide might fail to bolster sentiment on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nChristine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, said it was \u201cnot pessimistic\u201d to say that Europe was facing an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d.\n\nEuropeans had to be realistic, Lagarde told a panel discussion. \u201cWe are now getting this huge, big push, because another big player in the global economy is organising things in a different way, and is threatening some of the partners and the players with which that country was used to operate.\u201d\n\nForecasts from the IMF this month sharply upgraded economic prospects for the US this year, predicting 2.7 per cent growth, far above the Eurozone\u2019s predicted 1 per cent expansion.\n\nThe currency area\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, has experienced two years of contraction and is forecast to expand by just 0.3 per cent this year, the fund said. Meanwhile the US took a record share of cross-border greenfield investment projects in the 12 months to November, according to preliminary data from fDI Markets, an FT-owned company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty consensual that things are going really well for America and it looks really negative for Europe,\u201d said the head of a large sovereign wealth fund. \u201cPeople are worried about Germany and France\u2019s lack of leadership, the advance of the far right, the regulation of AI and the strength of the union.\n\n\u201cThe question is, is there enough of a crisis feeling to get Europe to rally? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nThe key risk in the US is that Trump\u2019s agenda ends up stoking up inflation and preventing the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates. The IMF warned of the risk of rising prices if Trump overstimulated the US economy while curbing the supply side of the economy through his immigration crackdown. A \u201cboom-bust cycle\u201d could follow in the longer term because of his financial deregulation drive, it said last week.\n\nBut such worries were overshadowed by the bullish short-term prospects, economists said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a big increase in animal spirits. You can see it in corporate sentiment, in consumer sentiment. There\u2019s also a rising probability that taxes won\u2019t be higher in 2026. That will be very good for aggregate demand,\u201d said Mike Medeiros, macro strategist at Wellington Management.\n\nWhile stronger US demand will benefit countries that rely heavily on exports to the US, investors in Davos spoke of the risk that growth in Europe might undershoot already dismal forecasts.\n\nStrained public finances in countries, including France and the UK, could leave them exposed to a further jump in longer-term borrowing costs driven by tax cuts in the US, they added.\n\n\u201cThe sovereign debt issue is really important. You see what it did to the UK a couple of weeks ago and the constraints that it puts on,\u201d said Kasim Kutay, chief executive of Novo Holdings, the $187bn investment company of the Novo Nordisk Foundation.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, European Commission president, told the WEF that the EU and US should negotiate to preserve trade relations, given that with trade volumes between them at \u20ac1.5tn and massive transatlantic investment, \u201ca lot is at stake for both sides\u201d.\n\nBrussels hopes that threats of steep tariffs will be a precursor to deals that avoid some of those barriers, as they did in Trump\u2019s first term. But the gulf with Brussels was in evidence this week as Trump announced the US\u2019s departure from the Paris climate agreement, a cornerstone of EU policy, and the World Health Organization.\n\nThe European economy had shown \u201cresilience\u201d in the face of shocks such as Covid-19 and the energy price surge following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, said Valdis Dombrovskis, EU economy commissioner. But he acknowledged that a deeper fragmentation in the global economic system would be \u201cvery costly for the EU, given the EU is a trading superpower\u201d.\n\nAt the same time, a deregulation drive in the US could further dent European competitiveness if governments fail to marshal an effective response.\n\nOne big global investor said they felt von der Leyen had been underplaying how difficult it would be to harness and galvanise a group of nations with widely varying views.\n\n\u201cThere needed to be a much more honest discussion about EU bureaucracy, obsessive regulation and the disparate views among a large number of countries,\u201d they said.\n\nRegulation of technology and artificial intelligence will prove to be a key test, executives said.\n\n\u201cOne thing that is going to guarantee that the continent is going to subside further into museum status is just taking a doctrinaire, conservative approach to regulation and not being open to the fact that maybe as technology evolves, Europe needs to evolve with it,\u201d said one technology executive.\n\nCarlos Cuerpo, Spain\u2019s economy minister, told the Financial Times he had come to Davos to counter the view that Europe was moribund, touting his country\u2019s own stellar record, after it outpaced US performance last year with estimated growth of 3.1 per cent and record job creation.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting that perception, because it is important that there is a positive message coming from the EU,\u201d he said. He emphasised the need for urgency in proceeding with \u201cour own road map\u201d, referring to the competitiveness report of former ECB president Mario Draghi.\n\nBut European officials struggled to project that positive message to executives in the Swiss resort. \u201cThe sentiment here is just how negative European CEOs are on Europe,\u201d said the US banking executive. \u201cThere is a stark contrast to the US, where it is all about animal spirits and euphoria.\u201d\n\nAsked if the election of Trump represented a wake-up call for Europe, Lagarde replied: \u201cI respectfully think that it does.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Stephen Morris and Arash Massoudi in Davos and Claire Jones in Washington\n\nData visualisation by Stephanie Stacey, Keith Fray, Ray Douglas and Alan Smith\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nHere\u2019s how Europe shrugs off its peak pessimism / From Gwenaelle Avice Huet, Executive Vice-President, European Operations, Schneider Electric, Paris, France", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7071e5cb-b9ad-490e-8702-44e9434aab1f"}}, {"id": "baf77f67-2a5a-4c09-8d28-25d8098f6847", "event_name": "Musician Leon Bridges: \u2018There\u2019s a specific Texas pride in Fort Worth\u2019", "blurb": "The Grammy Award winner loves his hometown for its tacos, dive bars and custom-made cowboy boots", "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "I\u00a0moved to Fort Worth when I was two years old, so I\u2019m Texan through and through.

There\u2019s a specific Texas pride here \u2013 in our roots and in our culture \u2013 and I think my music reflects that. It\u2019s Texas twang meets R&B and the whole Western aesthetic that goes along with it.\n\nThe city has seen the addition of many cool smaller hotels recently: Bowie House is one of the best. It\u2019s a great environment to meet people, and it\u2019s also near Dickies Arena, so people are drawn there from all over to see musicians such as Paul McCartney and Janet Jackson.

I still like to go and play impromptu shows with the original musicians from back in the day.\n\nCherry Coffee on Magnolia is always a stop for an Americano and gluten-free cake. It was started by friends, so I like to support them. Paris Coffee Shop is another old-school favourite. It\u2019s set in the Near Southside District and is a great spot for breakfast or lunch. Heim Barbecue is the place for classic Texan barbecue \u2013 brisket and pulled pork \u2013 Calisience does the best tacos and burritos and Shaw\u2019s Patio Bar & Grill serves late-night burgers and wings.\n\nThere is so much happening in Fort Worth now.

The factory will be used to build a new mid-size pick-up truck.\n\nStellantis is also investing at its plant in Detroit, Michigan, that will make a new Dodge car, plus its Toledo site in Ohio that produces Jeep trucks, and its facilities at Kokomo in Indiana that manufacture vehicle engines.\n\nFilosa said the plans \u201centail a multibillion-dollar investment in our people, great products, and innovative technology, all here in the US\u201d.

In the event, the first shots in his war on the globalised economy happened on quite a different front. In his flurry of orders and memos this week, Trump definitively withdrew already shaky US support for the global compromise on taxing the profits of multinational corporations, a reform painstakingly worked out over the past decade. He also threatened punitive retaliation on any country levying \u201cextraterritorial\u201d or \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d taxes on US multinationals.\n\nThe new administration\u2019s challenge to the global deal is bad news all round. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it was clear to cash-strapped governments and their taxpayers that the old web of bilateral treaties designed to avoid double taxation increasingly facilitated double non-taxation for multinational companies. The ability to avoid tax by allocating profits in low-tax jurisdictions was not politically or financially sustainable.\n\nThis problem affected the US, too. Domestic rules making it easy to park accounting profits in tax havens reduced the US tax take and discouraged companies from investing or redistributing their funds at home. That is why, ironically, the first Trump administration helped drive reform forward. Much early political lifting was done by the then Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and his French counterpart.\n\nAgreement on profit-sharing and a minimum corporate tax rate was reached in 2021, but failed to be passed by Congress under the Biden administration. Some of the reforms are already being implemented in many countries, however, potentially boosting global tax revenues by roughly $200bn.\n\nThe US interest in reform had been prompted by other countries rebelling against the presence of large US businesses \u2014 in particular tech companies \u2014 that paid vanishingly little in tax. The UK, France, Italy and others passed laws to levy digital services taxes on such companies\u2019 local revenues. Turnover taxes are typically not covered by tax treaties, and they incurred Washington\u2019s ire. When the international tax deal was struck, these countries offered not to levy their DSTs in order to facilitate a multilateral approach.\n\nUS withdrawal from the reform will first of all hurt America itself. Other countries may continue to apply the global minimum tax rule against US companies or decide to reactivate their DSTs, unless Trump somehow bullies them into submission. If he manages to torpedo the rules\u2019 adoption by the rest of the world as well, we would return to the under-taxation of the past, with the same incentives for US and other multinationals to salt away profits offshore.\n\nA better outcome is conceivable. The EU has said it aims to hold discussions with the new administration on how to achieve the goal of ensuring effective minimum taxation of multinationals. Even if a change of heart seems unlikely in the White House, other countries should strive to tax multinationals\u2019 profits sensibly within a coalition of the willing. They have a number of options to deal with the US and other non-collaborating nations. Countries with DSTs could simply let the levy work; those without could introduce one. A co-ordinated approach at the EU level could be pursued, although that would not be straightforward. The repercussions if the Trump administration retaliated, meanwhile, could be grave.\n\nTrump has threatened both tariffs and punitive US taxes on citizens and companies from countries that defy his demand. Those countries are not powerless to push back. But the stakes are high. With a stroke of a pen, Trump has raised the risk that a whole web of cross-border investment stakes might be unwound.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nA history of discriminatory targeting of US companies / From Anne Gordon, Vice President for International Tax Policy, National Foreign Trade Council, Washington, DC, US", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9a7c3f74-cb95-491a-9ec0-a10987b21634"}}, {"id": "f18e86e3-f84b-4347-9f36-7405ae6fc12f", "event_name": "OpenAI spars with Elon Musk over $500bn Stargate project", "blurb": "Tesla boss in rare break with Donald Trump over AI initiative, saying \u2018they don\u2019t actually have the money\u2019 ", "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0", "body": "OpenAI hit back at Elon Musk\u2019s criticism of Stargate, the new $500bn artificial intelligence infrastructure project hailed by Donald Trump as a \u201cresounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential under a new president\u201d.\n\nIn a rare break with Trump, Musk on Tuesday evening poured cold water on the project, writing: \u201cThey don\u2019t actually have the money.\u201d He added that he had it \u201con good authority\u201d that SoftBank had secured less than $10bn.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s chief executive Sam Altman responded on Wednesday that Musk\u2019s claim was \u201cwrong, as you surely know\u201d.\n\n\u201cI realise what is great for the country isn\u2019t always what\u2019s optimal for your companies, but in your new role i hope you\u2019ll mostly put [the US] first,\u201d he wrote on X.\n\nWhile Stargate\u2019s founding investors \u2014 SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle and MGX, the Abu Dhabi state AI fund \u2014 will put some of their own capital to work in the company, a large portion of the initial $100bn was expected to come from new investors who had not yet been identified, said one person involved in the project.\n\nAnother person involved said the funding would be a combination of equity from the founding partners and co-investors, as well as debt, but they added: \u201cWe are prepared to deploy $100bn immediately.\u201d\n\nMusk, who co-chairs the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, has been in a long-running feud with OpenAI, Altman and the start-up\u2019s biggest backer Microsoft.

He\u2019s there again this week and shared this early snapshot from conversations at the convening of top corporate and political leaders:\n\n\u201cEvery business, you will see pulling back from DEI,\u201d Nikki Haley, the US politician who now serves as vice chair of consultancy Edelman, told a packed room full of executives. Haley said she welcomed a retreat from diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and understood the feelings of white men who felt they were treated unfairly.\n\nIn private conversations, other US and European executives similarly confessed they felt corporations had gone too far and expressed relief the pendulum was swinging back away from DEI. But others noted that diversity was linked to business outperformance, with 44 per cent of the fastest-growing and most profitable companies saying the impact of their DEI efforts is strongly positive, according to AlixPartners research.\n\nAnd, in practice, DEI describes a broad group of activities ranging from gender and racial quotas to pay-equity analysis and diversity training. So it remains unclear what a retreat from DEI would mean exactly.\n\n\u201cWe have to judge results, not press releases,\u201d cautioned Lareina Yee, McKinsey senior partner. But Intesa Sanpaolo, the 90,000-employee Italian bank, is leaning into DEI programs.\n\n\u201cWe believe there is a value in diversity, particularly because the young people are asking for this,\u201d Intesa Sanpaolo chief financial officer Luca Bocca explained. The bank has had a requirement for the last several years that 50 per cent of all new executive appointments must go to women and has no plans to abandon that.\n\nRunning a business is rewarding in plenty of ways \u2014 not least in terms of salary. But it can also be extremely lonely. Having friends at work becomes complicated (or even impossible), and you can\u2019t be sure if people like you, or if they\u2019re just saying what they think you want to hear. If you\u2019re the boss, how can you learn to live with those downsides?

It also has partnerships with tournaments including the French and Miami Open.\n\nPrivately owned Lacoste, founded more than 90 years ago by tennis player Ren\u00e9 \u201cthe Crocodile\u201d Lacoste, has under Guibert emerged from a decade-long turnaround that has turned it from being a purveyor of discount polo shirts into a more premium sports and casual wear brand.\n\nSales rose 8 per cent to about \u20ac3bn last year in a testing retail market, putting it on track to reach \u20ac4bn in sales between 2028 and 2030.\n\n\u201cI think we can maintain a growth rate of 5 to 10 per cent, depending on market conditions, which will get us to that figure in the coming years,\u201d said Guibert, who previously worked for French luxury group PPR \u2014 now Kering \u2014 and ran entertainment and electronics retailer Fnac.\n\nLacoste is the biggest label in the Swiss family-controlled MF Brands, which also owns Gant and The Kooples.\n\nTo shake up Lacoste, Guibert took inspiration from the success of Spanish fast-fashion group Zara as well as sports group Nike in the period before 2017 \u2014 when it positioned itself at the premium end of the market before running into difficulties.\n\nLacoste bought back licences for its shoes, leather goods and undergarments and took back control of its distribution networks, moving to a 70 per cent proportion of sales in its own retail stores and 30 per cent through wholesalers, from the inverse ratio previously, in order to better control the brand image and pricing.\n\nCapital investment was doubled to between \u20ac100mn and \u20ac150mn a year, with a push into digital as it rushed to catch up with competitors. It also expanded into womenswear and brought in new design leadership, culminating in a return to presenting collections at Paris Fashion Week in 2024.\n\nNow Guibert has ambitions to move into hospitality as more consumers focus spending on experiences rather than physical goods \u2014 something luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Dior have already picked up on.

Leaving\u00a0Paris\u00a0is not good for America or the world.\u201d\n\nThat was Elon Musk in 2017, when Donald Trump announced that the US would withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change. Musk was joined in a chorus of critical statements by high-profile chief executives including Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google.\n\nThis week, Trump declared a US exit from the Paris accord for the second time, on the day of his inauguration, as he had promised. Musk, far from repudiating the president, got so excited while celebrating Trump\u2019s return that he gave a crowd two straight-armed gestures that looked to some observers like fascist salutes (Musk described this suggestion as \u201cdirty tricks\u201d). Cook, Zuckerberg and Pichai were all in attendance as Trump was sworn in. They and other major US corporate leaders have been silent on Trump\u2019s Paris agreement decision. It\u2019s a stark illustration of how far the culture has shifted among top executives in the country when it comes to public positioning on green policy.\n\nTrump\u2019s declaration on the Paris accord was one of several first-day executive orders that shredded Joe Biden\u2019s climate policy, as the new president aims to speed fossil fuel development and slow low-carbon energy growth. In today\u2019s edition, we look at the implications for clean energy businesses and investors \u2014 and why Trump would be politically wise not to push his anti-green drive as far as he might like.\n\nFaced with what he considers a catastrophic energy shortage, the new US president has slammed the brakes on one of the country\u2019s fastest-growing sources of power.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s flurry of executive orders on Monday, in which he announced a \u201cnational energy emergency\u201d while imposing an indefinite ban on new approvals for wind farms, looks incoherent if one assumes that his main concern is truly energy security and affordability.\u00a0It makes sense only through the prism of a culture war in which \u2014 at least in Trump\u2019s eyes \u2014 fossil fuels are associated with conservative values and renewables with the left.\n\nWhile the subjects of Monday\u2019s 26 executive orders ranged from foreign terrorists to renaming the Gulf of Mexico, the several dedicated to energy or climate issues made clear that this field is right at the top of Trump\u2019s second-term agenda.\n\nIn addition to the well trailed declaration pulling the US out of the Paris agreement, there was the hammer blow aimed at the wind farms Trump has so often excoriated. The latter suspends the approval of new wind projects pending a federal review, sending a chilling signal to investors and developers in what had become one of the world\u2019s most important wind power sectors, providing 10 per cent of US electricity generation. Shares in wind turbine maker Vestas fell by 5.5 per cent (wind farm developer \u00d8rsted fell by more than 17 per cent, having announced a major US asset writedown shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration).\n\nThe wind farm order was couched in language about environmental concerns, ordering a review to \u201cconsider the environmental impact of onshore and offshore wind projects upon wildlife, including, but not limited to, birds and marine mammals\u201d. This strikes quite a contrast with the silence on the welfare of birds and mammals in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, which Trump yesterday declared open for oil and gas drilling in a third declaration. Two other orders instructed federal agencies to identify measures to promote fossil fuel production, and to find restrictive energy regulations to be junked.\n\nGreen optimists can point out that, despite Trump\u2019s long-standing scepticism towards clean energy, investment in that sector surged during his first term in office. Installed renewable capacity (not including hydroelectric power) rose from 141GW in 2016 to 235GW in 2020, according to BloombergNEF.\n\nTheir pessimistic counterparts will note that Trump\u2019s antipathy towards renewables seems to have hardened since then. In 2018, his energy department issued an announcement titled: \u201cBIDDING BONANZA! Trump Administration Smashes Record for Offshore Wind Auction\u201d. After Trump\u2019s strike against the sector at the outset of his second term, it\u2019s hard to imagine any such green energy cheerleading from his second administration.\n\nFurther bad news for green investors came with the order to halt all disbursement of grants and loans under the Inflation Reduction Act, putting more than $300bn of potential federal funding at risk, according to FT analysis. The Biden administration, seeing this coming, had rushed to deploy funds during its last months in office.\n\nA bigger question is over the future of the tax credits created by the IRA, which account for the lion\u2019s share of its projected economic impact. Academics at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business have estimated that the total value of the climate and energy-related fiscal support under the legislation would amount to $1.05tn between 2023 and 2032.\n\nEliminating the IRA tax credits would require legislation to be passed by Congress, and it\u2019s far from clear that this is on the cards. The bulk of the green investments stimulated by the legislation have been in Republican-voting congressional districts \u2014 notably in Texas, now a hub for renewable energy. Last August, 18 US House Republicans wrote to speaker Mike Johnson pleading for the law to be kept in place, given its positive impact on local employment.\n\nFor Trump, policy on low-carbon energy is a matter of conflicting priorities. On one hand, supporting continued investment into the sector will create jobs, boost energy security, bolster the US\u2019s long-term economic competitiveness and help it in its strategic contest with China.\n\nOn the other hand, undermining green investment will play well with a large number of Trump\u2019s supporters who view it as part of a leftwing agenda, and especially with the oil industry magnates who have been major donors to his and his allies\u2019 campaigns.\n\nYesterday\u2019s executive orders have still left a huge amount to be decided, pending the outcome of the slew of reviews that they announced, and the legal and legislative challenges the administration will face on many of its goals. But as Trump\u2019s second term proceeds, we\u2019ll discover which of those competing priorities will win out.\n\nGoing quiet European asset managers are following their US rivals in \u201cpulling back\u201d from public positioning on climate action.\n\nHot seat Brazil\u2019s government has appointed diplomat Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago as president-designate of this year\u2019s COP30 climate summit.\n\nBig spender Microsoft has agreed to buy about $200mn worth of carbon credits linked to Brazilian forest projects.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e45f915c-5af6-4759-ad96-0cf518923748"}}, {"id": "d497080e-816d-48ff-88fb-754fd98dee33", "event_name": "The strange liberal nonchalance about Trump\u2019s return", "blurb": "Having supposedly worried too much about him last time, people are overcorrecting", "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Even the anti-Donald Trump graffiti on the streets of West Hollywood is scarce and halfhearted now. Eight years ago, California was the \u201cresistance\u201d state. It is a different mood that a visitor encounters in 2025: resignation, boredom with the subject, a we-had-it-coming attitude among thoughtful Democrats and, at times, something approaching curiosity about the economic potential of America under a deregulating president.\n\nA great liberal shrug is going on. It has been happening around the world since Trump clinched his win in November, and it is natural. You can\u2019t be angry all the time. In the autocracies of 20th-century Europe, people of dissenting conscience often made what was known as an \u201cinner migration\u201d. That is, rather than flee or fight, they withdrew into private life as the political realm darkened around them. To detach like this is clever, not weak.\n\nJust don\u2019t overdo it, that\u2019s all. I sense that liberals have allowed a healthy acceptance of electoral reality to cross into a hope that Trump\u2019s second term won\u2019t be so bad. Please.\n\nThree things softened the impact of Trump last time. None of them applies now. First, he craved re-election. This made him willing to provoke the median voter to a certain point, but no farther. (The speed with which he disowned the faintly theocratic Project 2025 last summer showed how much this supposed hothead seeks to avoid needless unpopularity.) Unless something happens to the 22nd Amendment, Trump is now liberated from the innate discipline of electoral politics. Even the midterms mean little, as the race to succeed him will begin straight after. Second-term presidents have two years.\n\nWhat else? His first administration was peopled with enough old-fashioned Republicans \u2014 Gary Cohn, Rex Tillerson \u2014 to curb his excesses. He is now spoilt for officials and cabinet secretaries who are in the Maga mould. Tulsi Gabbard could be at the helm of US intelligence soon. There is nothing Stoic or urbane in brushing that off.\n\nAbove all, the world in 2017 was stable enough to absorb a certain amount of chaos. Inflation was low and Europe at peace. The last major pandemic in the west was a century in the past. It is into much frailer webbing that Trump will hurl his tariffs and foreign escapades this time.\n\nWe could go on in this vein, citing practical and contingent reasons to worry. We could mention the federal judiciary, which is more Trump-tinged now than it was when he first took office. Will it constrain him? We could also mention that he will be 82 when he stands down. Last time, he had to think about the legal exposure, earning potential and social reputation he would have in his post-presidential life. Will that be such a factor now?\n\nIn the end, however, my argument \u2014 and a lot of political commentary \u2014 comes down to instinct. There is a hubris in Maga-world right now that just wasn\u2019t there in 2017, in part because Trump hadn\u2019t won the popular vote. Talk of much higher economic growth, territorial conquest, putting a US flag on Mars: if this doesn\u2019t reek to you of pride before a fall, of imminent over-reach, then we just have different antennas. (And I hope mine is wrong.) In all democracies, a party is never more dangerous than when high on fresh electoral success. The difference with the US is the size of the stakes for the outside world. Think of George W Bush after his historically good midterms in 2002, or Lyndon Johnson\u2019s escalation in Vietnam after 1964, when his vote pile could be seen from space.\n\nYes, a war of choice is improbable under Trump. (Though events can push leaders into uncharacteristic actions. Remember, the perception of Bush before September 11 was that he was a do-nothing isolationist.) More likely, a tariff spree will set off an uncontrollable world response, or the economy will be run too hot, or the constitution will creak to breaking point as Trump seeks to reward friends and hound enemies. At the least, there will be internal recriminations when it becomes clear that public debt, urban squalor and America\u2019s other issues aren\u2019t amenable to a techno-libertarian fix.\n\nWhatever the precise form of the coming chaos, the relative lack of worry about it is what stands out from eight years ago. The liberal line in 2025 seems to go something like this: we overdid the panic about Trump last time, so let\u2019s not repeat the mistake. Neither half of this proposition survives the slightest intellectual audit. The panic was borne out, unless the two impeachments \u2014 one for seeking to overturn an election result \u2014 somehow don\u2019t count. Also, even if the first term wasn\u2019t so bad, why assume the second will be just the same? Trump and his movement are much more serious entities now. His inaugural speech this week was formidable in vision and expression.\n\nNone of this means that people who dislike Trump should take the man\u2019s advice to \u201cfight, fight, fight\u201d. Protest and activism have been dead-ends for the Democrats. But if smugness was bad, so is cringing self-doubt. The lesson of the 2024 election for liberals was, or should have been, narrow: stop choosing useless candidates. This has somehow grown into a broader crisis of confidence about whether their underlying assessment of Trump as a menace was ever right. Being vindicated over the coming years is going to be no fun at all.\n\njanan.ganesh@ft.com", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e11b77b4-eb8a-438c-ba74-39715781bf35"}}, {"id": "4affbb5c-9efa-4dca-8226-692048023bd8", "event_name": "\u2018A fantastic woman\u2019: can Giorgia Meloni be Europe\u2019s Trump whisperer?

But the US president has so far overlooked Rome on this issue, telling reporters on Monday that \u201cSpain was very low\u201d and threatening to impose tariffs on the alliance\u2019s biggest laggard on military spending.\n\nTrump has said Nato\u2019s new spending target should be 5 per cent of GDP, a difficult goal for countries such as Italy, France and Germany whose economies are barely growing and which are struggling to rein in public spending and debt.\n\nMeloni\u2019s supporters say her \u201cprivileged relationship\u201d with the US administration gives her a better chance than any of her EU peers to make the case against tariffs and other punitive measures.\n\n\u201cWith any important decision that affects Italy and Europe, Giorgia Meloni will have the chance to be heard,\u201d said Lucio Malan, a senator from her rightwing Brothers of Italy party. \u201cThe voice of Italy will be heard\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that is something.\u201d\n\nBut Meloni could still struggle to act as Europe\u2019s interlocutor with Trump, said Beniamino Irdi, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear how much interest Trump has in cultivating a real relationship with Europe,\u201d Irdi said. \u201cHe has always had a tendency to prefer bilateral relations with nation states that actually have the authority and power to make things happen.\u201d\n\nMeloni\u2019s contacts seem to have paid off even before Trump\u2019s inauguration. After seeing the Republican in Mar-a-Lago earlier this month, she secured the release of an Italian journalist from Iran. In return, Italy released Mohammed Abedini \u2014 an Iranian national who was sought by the US for allegedly smuggling drone technology to Tehran.\n\nThe prisoner swap has boosted Meloni\u2019s approval ratings \u2014 now higher than when she took office more than two years ago. \u201cBy having the guts to go to Trump she expressed real leadership and effectiveness and this was absorbed by public opinion,\u201d said Lorenzo Pregliasco, founder of YouTrend, an Italian pollster.\n\nBrothers of Italy has long cultivated ties with US Republicans and the Trump world, with Meloni attending the National Prayer Breakfast during the first Trump presidency.\n\nIn 2018, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideologue Steve Bannon was the main attraction at the party\u2019s annual political festival in Rome. In 2023, US billionaire and tech mogul Elon Musk was the top guest. He and Meloni have since forged strong personal and political ties, with her government pursuing negotiations with his SpaceX company for secure military communications.\n\nStefano Stefanini, Italy\u2019s former ambassador to Nato, said that in the months ahead, Meloni could probably play a \u201cuseful softening role\u201d in her talks with Trump on Ukraine and security, including trying to persuade him to accept a more gradual increase in defence spending.\n\n\u201cThere is no way Italy is going to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence,\u201d he said. \u201cItaly might reach 2 [per cent] or even 3 per cent, and she might get away with it convincing Trump that Italy \u2014 as well as other European countries \u2014 are moving towards the target gradually.\u201d\n\nBut on issues such as a ceasefire deal between Russia and Ukraine, it was unclear to what extent the US president would listen to her, Stefanini said.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009of any foreign leader who really had influence on Trump\u2019s decisions.\u201d\n\nMeloni might have more success in shielding some Italian products from Trump\u2019s tariffs, Stefanini said. But that could lead to friction between Rome and the European Commission, which runs trade policy on behalf of the bloc.\n\n\u201cBy having a successful bilateral relationship with Washington, Meloni can show other European leaders that it is the best way to deal with the Trump administration\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009not through Brussels,\u201d Stefanini said.\n\n\u201cThat will weaken the EU, but a weak EU is something that Trump wants.\u201d", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e800e6b6-912d-4123-a70b-c422518727ad"}}, {"id": "c2c1c803-9d5e-4c18-8426-3aa6ce9fdc58", "event_name": "Donald Trump vs the \u2018deep state\u2019: president\u2019s vendetta agenda takes shape", "blurb": "The US president is already making good on his promise to go after his enemies", "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Donald Trump relished the thought that his return to the White House would give him the power to take down the \u201cdeep state\u201d actors who once opposed him \u2014 and almost sent him to prison.\n\nJust hours after he was sworn in as the US\u2019s 47th president, his vengeance campaign was under way.\n\nAmong the early targets was John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser and one of the president\u2019s harshest critics. First Bolton\u2019s security clearance was revoked. Then Trump ordered the removal of the protective detail assigned to Bolton in 2019 after threats to his life from Iran.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have security detail on people for the rest of their lives \u2014 why should we? I thought he was a very dumb person,\u201d said Trump on Tuesday.\n\nBolton said he was \u201cdisappointed but not surprised\u201d.\n\nThat may just be the beginning as Trump moves to crush perceived opponents in government, homing in on targets from intelligence agencies to the military, financial and business regulators, and within the law enforcement apparatus itself.\n\nIt could mark a new era for the US \u2014 and the way it is ruled, with favour and punishment dispensed according to the whims of a leader, not the judgments of career officials guided by the long-agreed rules of their institutions.\n\nFor Trump, it is a moment of vindication as he roots out the officials who thwarted his agenda during his first term or deepened his legal jeopardy as federal criminal cases mounted against him in 2023.\n\n\u201cNever again will the immense power of the state be weaponised to persecute political opponents,\u201d he said in his inaugural address at the Capitol on Monday.\n\nHours later, he signed an executive order on the \u201cweaponisation\u201d of government, authorising sweeping reviews of US intelligence and other agencies to correct \u201cpast misconduct\u201d through \u201cappropriate action\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an open-ended, anti-resistance move,\u201d said Yuval Levin, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, referring to the order.\n\nHe said it was \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d whether Trump was simply sending a message for civil servants to \u201cstay out of the way\u201d of his radical agenda or \u201cto rearrange the bureaucracy so that it\u2019s more completely at the service of the president\u201d.\n\nIntelligence agencies are a particular focus for Trump. In another of the executive orders signed during Monday night\u2019s blitz, Trump stripped the security clearances of 50 former intelligence officials, claiming that they co-ordinated with former president Joe Biden\u2019s campaign to discredit reporting about his scandal-prone son Hunter Biden.\n\nThe order echoed language used by Kash Patel, Trump\u2019s controversial pick to head the FBI who is awaiting Senate confirmation.\n\nPatel has long argued for the removal of security clearances to eradicate the \u201cdeep state\u201d.\n\nA former US intelligence official said the measure would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d in the agencies. \u201cThis is a clear sign that Trump will use clearances for political reasons. That will make people wary to speak their minds.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything that suggests clearances are being manipulated for political purposes will hurt trust with the intelligence community,\u201d said Emily Harding, director of the intelligence, national security and technology programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nTrump has also sent a clear message to the Pentagon, where just minutes after his inauguration officials removed a portrait of his former top military adviser \u2014 and eventually arch critic \u2014 retired General Mark Milley. On Monday, Trump also fired Linda Fagan, the commandant of the coastguard, with a senior official saying she had \u201cexcessive focus on diversity, equity and inclusion\u201d and mishandled border security.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s plans go far beyond America\u2019s security apparatus. The executive order on \u201cweaponisation\u201d called for more scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, along with other enforcement agencies such as the justice department.\n\nPam Bondi, Trump\u2019s pick for attorney-general, has vowed that the \u201cinvestigators will be investigated\u201d and \u201cthe bad\u201d prosecutors would be prosecuted.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that this authorises the very weaponisation itself of the government against perceived enemies,\u201d said Ryan Goodman, professor at the New York University School of Law.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily there may be nothing wrong with retrospective investigations into potential government wrongdoing,\u201d he added. But this order \u201chas been teed up with nominees in mind who would come into the government with an enemies list. That is a very worrisome combination for the state of democracy in the country.\u201d\n\nTrump previously called for the prosecution of opponents, including Nancy Pelosi, former Democratic Speaker of the House, and former vice-president Kamala Harris, whom he defeated in the 2024 general election. He has also threatened to appoint a special prosecutor to \u201cgo after\u201d Joe Biden.\n\nBiden himself took this threat \u2014 and others \u2014 seriously enough to issue pre-emptive pardons to members of his own family and top potential targets such as Milley and members of the panel that probed the January 6 2021 attack on the Capitol Building, including former congresswoman Liz Cheney, just before he left office.\n\nTrump is also taking aim at federal workers, vowing to strip employment protections, which were strengthened under Biden, for tens of thousands of career civil servants in \u201cpolicy-related\u201d jobs \u2014 a way to easily fire government workers who balk at his agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, as he was stripping security clearances from his perceived foes, he issued a separate executive order to immediately grant temporary clearances to \u201cqualified and trusted personnel\u201d of his choosing.\n\n\u201cOur foreign adversaries are salivating at this Trump Executive Order that grants immediate Top Secret clearances to individuals without the proper vetting and background checks,\u201d Olivia Troye, a former Trump administration official turned critic of the president, wrote on X.", "region_codes": ["US"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/cfe4f220-23c2-40a7-b3aa-da9eba080ee1"}}]
