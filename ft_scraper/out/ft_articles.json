In 2015, the then chancellor George Osborne introduced rights allowing individuals to move their defined benefit pension scheme to a defined contribution pot.\n\nMore than 100,000 transfers were undertaken in the five years after that, according to LCP, and six-figure transfer values were the norm. In many cases these transfers were undertaken specifically so the value of those pension pots could be passed on when the member died.\n\nIn last year\u2019s Budget, chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that unused pension funds will be included within IHT from April 2027.\n\n\u201cApplying inheritance tax to pension balances could prove to be a real gold mine for the government for many years to come,\u201d said Tim Camfield, senior consultant at LCP, who carried out the analysis.\n\nWhile he acknowledged that some retirees may react to tax changes by drawing down on pension assets faster, the changes will still generate significant tax revenue because such withdrawals will be subject to income tax, he said.\n\n\u201cEither way, as the DB transfer generation gets older, the government will start to see a multibillion pound revenue stream from the income tax or IHT on their pension pots,\u201d Camfield added.\n\nAccording to a freedom of information request from investment platform Interactive Investor to the Office for Budget Responsibility, an estimated 31,200 more estates will be subject to IHT in the three years from the 2027-28 tax year than if pensions had not been included in estates.\n\nThe OBR estimates that 66,600 people will pay inheritance tax in 2029-30, up from 40,100 in the current tax year.\n\nLCP calculates that these numbers should continue to surge because the peak in transfer activity from DB schemes to DC schemes was in 2017-18, after which tighter rules around financial advice followed by a fall in transfer values led to a dramatic reduction in the volume of transfers.\n\nThe typical person who transferred was in their late fifties, according to LCP. As these people gradually die over the coming years, any unspent balances in their transferred pension fund will be potentially liable to IHT.\n\nRob Morgan, chief analyst at wealth manager Charles Stanley, said that enhanced death benefits tended to be \u201cthe overriding factor\u201d for people choosing to transfer out of DB into DC.\n\n\u201cOn the basis that people will mostly have only done this where there is ample income and assets elsewhere, we can infer that there will be IHT consequences in many cases,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nData from the Financial Conduct Authority shows that between April 2015 and September 2018, more than 170,000 people who received advice transferred their DB scheme to a DC pot, with an average transfer value of over \u00a3350,000. This suggests the total amount transferred in this period was over \u00a350bn.\n\nShaun Moore, tax and financial planning expert at Quilter, a wealth manager, said a freeze in the inheritance tax threshold \u2014 which is set to last until 2030 \u2014 plus the inclusion of pensions from 2027 would enable the government to \u201ccash in on an ever-expanding pool of taxpayers\u201d.\n\nThe IHT tax-free threshold has been set at \u00a3325,000 since 2009. The impact of the frozen threshold alongside inflation and rising asset values means more people have been dragged into paying inheritance tax, with the trend likely to continue.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6608ece0-7522-4f36-b1f0-d1ff66c269c3"}, {"title": "Defined benefit pension reform \u2018unlikely to be silver bullet\u2019 say trustees", "description": "UK government argue that funds should release surpluses back to companies for investment", "author": "Mary McDougall", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.767Z", "content": "Pension trustees warn that allowing companies to access surpluses trapped in defined benefit pension schemes is unlikely to deliver the jolt to the economy that the government hopes for.\n\nThe UK government said this week that lifting the restrictions on companies using money from their DB pension schemes \u2014 in excess of what they owe members \u2014 would \u201cunlock billions to drive growth\u201d.\n\nAccording to an FT analysis of company accounts there are over 30 companies in the FTSE 100 with DB schemes with surpluses of at least \u00a3100mn and a funding ratio of at least 110 per cent. Most declined to comment when contacted by the FT.\n\nEnergy company SSE said it was looking at the opportunities the reforms represent, but noted any impact would be relatively small.\n\nSchroders said after the announcement its would use \u2018\u2019approximately 10 per cent\u2019\u2019 of its scheme\u2019s DB section\u2019s surplus per year to support funding for defined contribution members.\n\nMost schemes can already access surpluses in their DB schemes, provided they passed a resolution in 2016 permitting them to do so, according to pensions consultant LCP. But in practice few do.\n\nOnly \u00a3180mn of surplus was accessed by companies between 2018 to 2023, according to government estimates last year. Any surplus extracted is taxed at a rate of 25 per cent, having been lowered from 35 per cent last year.\n\nWhere DB and DC pension funds are set up within the same trust, DB surpluses can be transferred to DC members if the scheme rules permit it without incurring a tax charge.\n\nTrade groups have broadly welcomed the government\u2019s proposals, provided appropriate guardrails are in place to protect members, but trustees have privately expressed doubts.\n\n\u201cWhy would I want to give away my comfort blanket?\u201d said one trustee of a FTSE 100 company pension scheme. He was sceptical that he would be prepared to release its surplus to executives, noting that for many years the scheme was in deficit and a fall in government bond yields could make its funding position more vulnerable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the silver bullet that the government hopes for,\u201d said another, adding that the total DB scheme surplus was only about \u00a368bn on a buyout basis \u2014 the level at which companies with the right permissions can access their surpluses.\n\n\u201cFirst you have to work out how much to give members, then you have to agree how much to give the company factoring you will have to pay 25 per cent tax,\u201d he said, adding that the time it takes to make these decisions was also \u201cnot trivial\u201d.\n\nRob Gardner, former co-chief executive of pensions consultancy Redington and founder of Rebalance Earth, a flood mitigation investor, said if he were a trustee weighing the return of a surplus to an employer there would be \u201csignificant challenges\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy fiduciary duty is to act in the best interests of members, and the potential long-term risks to them may outweigh the short-term benefits to the employer,\u201d he said.\n\nThe government estimates that around 75 per cent of the UK\u2019s \u00a31.2tn defined benefit corporate pension schemes are in surplus, worth a total of around \u00a3160bn. Some 96 per cent of these schemes \u2014 which provide pensions to 8.8mn people \u2014 are closed to new members.\n\nMinisters have been working out how to extract money from DB schemes after a rapid rise in interest rates radically improved scheme funding levels in 2022. The government\u2019s plans follow a consultation by the Conservative government last spring.\n\nPolicymakers also hope trustees will be emboldened to invest in more risky assets, rather than preparing schemes to be sold to insurance companies in a process known as buyout.\n\nBut Sankar Mahalingham, managing director at professional trustee firm Law Debenture, said it was \u201cunlikely that there will be a large number who will suddenly take a very different look at their investment strategy\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Pension Protection Fund, schemes had a net deficit on a buyout basis of almost \u00a3500bn as recently as 2019. That figure is now a surplus of \u00a368bn.\n\nWhen the Financial Times asked the Treasury if it would lower the \u2018buyout basis\u2019 threshold, a spokesperson said that \u201cschemes will continue to have to satisfy stringent funding requirements to be eligible to extract surplus\u201d.\n\nThe previous government\u2019s consultation explored enhancing protection from the Pension Protection Fund to 100 per cent to encourage trustees to be more comfortable with taking on more risk and releasing surpluses, as well as assessing if the tax rate for tapping surpluses should be lowered.\n\nThe Treasury told the FT it would set out these details \u201cin the spring\u201d.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c4df1f70-dd8d-4876-aa35-5d189657be66"}, {"title": "Starmer refuses to tear up workers\u2019 rights bill as compromises loom ", "description": "Prime minister will listen to business over exact details, as some within Labour push for \u2018serious tooth removal\u2019  ", "author": "Jim Pickard", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.714Z", "content": "Sir Keir Starmer is resisting pressure from business and some within his own party to tear up a new workers\u2019 rights bill, even as government officials conceded that details of the policy were still up for grabs.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s allies told the Financial Times he was fully committed to the \u201cmake work pay\u201d plan, which is seen in Number 10 as essential to tackling low pay, improving insecure employment and raising productivity even though it is expected to cost businesses \u00a35bn.\n\nBut senior Labour figures argue it may have to be made more business-friendly in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cIt needs serious tooth removal,\u201d said one Labour official close to Starmer. Another influential adviser said: \u201cThere is a view in the Treasury and DBT [business and trade department] that this shouldn\u2019t upset the growth apple cart too much.\u201d\n\nThe workers\u2019 rights package was a key promise in Labour\u2019s manifesto, but business leaders have warned that piling even more costs on to companies will imperil the growth ambitions that Starmer and chancellor Rachel Reeves have set out as their core mission for the government.\n\nStarmer insisted in the House of Commons this week he would not abandon the principles of the legislation. \u201cWe believe in giving people proper dignity and protection at work,\u201d he said, calling the bill \u201cgood for working people and good for the economy\u201d.\n\nOne Starmer aide said: \u201cWe want the economy to grow and are prepared to take on the political fights to get that, but we also want some of the proceeds of growth to flow into the pockets of workers, especially tackling low pay and insecure employment.\u201d\n\nThe aide added: \u201cWe have consulted on the application of how we do that. So the measures may adjust to reflect that policy objective, but they will not limit our ambitions.\u201d\n\nMinisters are consulting businesses, unions and others on details of the Employment Rights bill, which is due to report to the House of Commons before Easter, in an increasingly tense political atmosphere.\n\nBusinesses are already smarting from last year\u2019s tax-raising Budget and a hike in the minimum wage that comes into force this April, while companies such as J Sainsbury and Airbus have already blamed higher costs for recent job cuts in the UK.\n\nNicola Smith, director of policy at the Trades Union Congress, said she believed ministers had strengthened their commitment to some parts of the bill, including a near-ban on employers using \u201cfire and rehire\u201d tactics to impose changes in contracts, which the legislation will allow only where a business is close to insolvency.\n\n\u201cFrom where I\u2019m sitting, we don\u2019t see any change of ambition,\u201d she added.\n\nThe proposals in the controversial package include scaling back zero-hours contracts and giving staff full rights of redress from their first day of employment.\n\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch this week branded it the \u201cunemployment bill\u201d and called on Starmer to ditch the entire package.\n\nOne imminent compromise will see ministers address concerns that employers could find themselves in endless consultation with unions over unconnected redundancies at different sites under the legislation as currently drafted.\n\nAt present, they are required to consult only when they make 20 or more workers redundant at a single site.\n\nMinisters have said they will bring forward amendments to the bill at the next stage of the parliamentary process \u2014 and both business and unions believe the timing of this next stage could slip into March.\n\nCraig Beaumont of the Federation of Small Businesses said two areas of focus for business lobbyists were around the proposals for day one protection against unfair dismissal, and the mechanism of the proposed \u201cban\u201d on exploitative zero and low hour contracts. However, he acknowledged the FSB was \u201cpitching for the stars\u201d in urging ministers to change the day one right to a protection that kicked in after a year.\n\nAngela Rayner, deputy prime minister and champion of the bill, has told colleagues that the idea of improving workers\u2019 rights is one of the Labour government\u2019s few popular policies, and a key weapon in the party\u2019s fight against Reform UK in working class seats.\n\n\u201cThe government is committed to implementing day one rights, ending insecurity, and strengthening the voice of working people,\u201d said one ally of Rayner.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4eb5e8ca-aba5-4426-8dce-4410dd313330"}, {"title": "City firms urge Rachel Reeves to curb cash Isas", "description": "Companies have told chancellor that scaling back tax breaks on savings accounts could boost UK financial services", "author": "Akila Quinio", "published_date": "2025-01-31T21:03:24.005Z", "content": "Big City firms are urging Rachel Reeves to scale back tax breaks for cash Isas, a form of saving beloved by millions of Britons, in an effort to boost UK financial services and the economy by channelling money into stocks.\n\nCompanies including insurance group Phoenix and the London Stock Exchange Group have told the chancellor that almost \u00a3300bn held in cash Isas could generate better returns for savers if invested in stocks and shares, while supporting the City\u2019s dwindling equities market.\n\nOne senior banker said the issue had been raised by several finance executives at a recent meeting with Reeves and that she had not rebuffed the idea.\n\n\u201cThe state should not be giving a tax break for us all to park our money in cash,\u201d said Andy Briggs, chief executive of Phoenix, which operates the Standard Life brand.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that Rachel Reeves will conclude that it makes sense to refocus Isa tax incentives to make them consistent with the government\u2019s very welcome growth agenda,\u201d added Briggs, who was at the meeting.\n\nScrapping the cash Isa would be the biggest shake-up of the savings market since the products were first introduced by then-Labour chancellor Gordon Brown in 1999.\n\nCash Isas allow savers to earn tax-free interest on up to \u00a320,000 a year and are by far the most popular of the UK\u2019s Isas. Surveys show that many Britons prefer keeping wealth in cash rather than investing in the stock market because they view it as safer.\n\nOne Treasury official lobbied on scrapping cash Isas by City firms said \u201cthey also like the idea that it could provide growth for their asset management arms. They say there is a huge amount of capital that could be doing much more.\u201d\n\nPeople close to the discussions said Reeves would be reluctant to change a popular form of savings, but the idea has not been ruled out.\n\n\u201cThey are quite important products for a lot of people so changing cash Isas would be quite a big deal,\u201d said another official.\n\nThe UK offers several different Isas, including a product for cash and another for stocks and shares\n\nBut the financial services industry has raised concerns that cash Isas are housing money that could be earning more in London-listed companies while supporting the UK\u2019s capital markets. Banks earn fees by helping companies sell shares to retail and institutional investors, while asset managers have suffered in recent years from investors pulling money from their UK equity funds.\n\nSteven Fine, chief executive of investment bank Peel Hunt, told the FT that he had \u201cconsistently been in touch\u201d with the Treasury about Isa reform, \u201cideally to limit or remove cash, with the balance in London-listed stocks and shares.\u201d\n\nAnother banker said that the government could limit the amount of cash held within an Isa, for example up to \u00a35,000, while the remaining, larger portion could be held in stocks and shares.\n\nThe chair of a UK asset manager said the industry has been calling for Isa reform, noting that there should be \u201ca single Isa, encouraging people to have more allocated into British stocks and shares.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury said: \u201cWe want to help people save for their future goals and build greater financial resilience across the country.

A further 9 per cent will need to change to accommodate climate benefits, such as sustainable farming practices.\n\nThe National Farmers\u2019 Union has warned that the sector is already being forced to scale back food production in favour of alternatives such as rewilding or growing crops for biofuels in order to keep their businesses viable.\n\nLosing additional farming land would also increase the UK\u2019s dependence on imported foodstuffs.\n\nThe estimates were published as part of the government\u2019s consultation into a long-awaited \u201cland use framework\u201d that aims to balance competing demands on England\u2019s land, from housing and renewable energy to food production and nature restoration.\n\n\u201cThe primary purpose of farming will always be to produce the food that feeds the nation,\u201d said environment secretary Steve Reed. He stressed that the framework would help decision makers protect \u201cour highest quality agricultural land and make decisions about the long-term future of farm businesses\u201d.\n\nAlongside the estimates, the government said that any impact on food production from the land use changes could be offset by using technology and sustainable farming techniques to increase crop yields.\n\nSuccessive governments have shied away from embarking on the framework over fears of the backlash it would receive from farmers.\n\nNFU president Tom Bradshaw said: \u201cWe must have a land use plan in place, underpinned by sound science and evidence, that has British food at its heart.\u201d\n\nBut Victoria Vyvyan, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said it could mean farmers being told \u201cwhat they are and aren\u2019t allowed to grow, plant and rear on their land\u201d and called for safeguards to prevent \u201cmission creep\u201d from officials.\n\n\u201cWhenever the state gets involved, its tendency is to only become ever more prescriptive,\u201d she added. \u201cToday, the framework might be light touch, but tomorrow it won\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nLiberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael, chair of the cross-party environment, food and rural affairs committee, said the framework was \u201clong overdue\u201d.\n\n\u201cFarmers need to be able to plan ahead and they and other stakeholders have long called for clarity amidst a myriad of often conflicting demands,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo-thirds of England\u2019s land is agricultural, according to official statistics, with 38 per cent made up of arable land and 29 per cent grassland. The country\u2019s population is predominantly urban, with 83 per cent of people living in built-up areas.\n\nEngland\u2019s farmers are already under pressure from the impact of heavy flooding, high inflation and huge cuts to their subsidy payments.\n\nMany are also furious about the Labour government\u2019s decision to\u00a0overturn inheritance tax rules, which means some will be liable to pay tax on inherited agricultural and business assets that were previously exempt.\n\nFarmers also face a shift to a new post-Brexit subsidy scheme that offers them incentives to restore the natural environment, sometimes at the expense of food production.\n\nThe Environmental Land Management schemes, or ELMs, provide payments for farmers to adopt sustainable farming practices such as soil management, or to take land out of farming altogether. Scotland and Wales have separate devolved systems.\n\nThe schemes have been criticised by farming groups such as the NFU, which say farmers are being paid to inadvertently lower the country\u2019s food production, despite the last government\u2019s commitment to maintaining food self-sufficiency.\n\nThe sector had hoped that a land use framework would offer clarity about the intentions behind farming policy.\n\nDowning Street said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to be clear that this isn\u2019t about the government dictating how land is used, or taking valuable, productive land away from farms.\n\n\u201cThe government recognises that land is in high demand, and that is why we are starting a national conversation with those involved, whether it be landowners, farmers, developers and more, about how we use it to its full potential, not least for food production.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9581872d-d6b8-4db4-b58f-698507644ddc"}, {"title": "UK to rely on skewed US trade figures to skirt Trump tariffs ", "description": "Long-standing statistical quirk means both sides report a trade surplus with the other ", "author": "Valentina Romei", "published_date": "2025-02-01T12:21:05.495Z", "content": "Sir Keir Starmer is using a long-standing statistical quirk to bolster his attempts to fend off Donald Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs, relying on US data that shows the UK is one of the few major economies with which America has a trade surplus.\n\nBritish ministers are focusing on the US data in their discussions with officials in the Trump administration, because its methodology is more helpful to their cause than the UK\u2019s own statistics.\n\n\u201cUsing America\u2019s own trade data provides a shared and strong foundation when engaging in discussions with our American friends,\u201d joked one senior British official.\n\nAccording to US figures, America ran an overall trade surplus with the UK in 2023, amounting to $14.5bn. That puts Britain in a favourable position as Trump threatens tariffs targeting countries with significant deficits.\n\nHowever, the Office for National Statistics reports that the UK ran a trade surplus with the US of \u00a371.4bn, or around $89bn, in 2023.\n\nTrump has threatened punitive tariffs on countries with which the US runs trade deficits, though his focus appears to be goods rather than services.\n\nWhile the bulk of the UK trade balance with the US is services, in 2023, the country reported a small goods trade surplus with the US of about $3bn. This still contrasts with the $9.7bn goods trade surplus the US reports with the UK.\n\nStarmer and Lord Mandelson, the new UK ambassador to Washington, are arguing that Trump should spare Britain from any general application of tariffs given the trading position between the two countries.\n\nThe statistics offices across the Atlantic are aware of the differences and have been co-operating to realign the data since 2017. Both highlighted how the differences are larger when measuring trade in services.\n\nTrade asymmetries are common and differences \u201ccan be caused by a range of conceptual and measurement variations between the estimation practices of different countries,\u201d warned the ONS.\n\nA key issue in the UK-US figures is the treatment of Crown Dependencies, the three offshore island territories in the British Islands that are self-governing possessions of the British Crown.\n\nThe US Bureau of Economic Analysis includes trade with Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man in the UK data, while the ONS does not.\n\nGiven that Jersey alone hosts over 35,000 financial firms managing more than \u00a3450bn in assets, this omission has a material impact.\n\nThe US reports exporting $4.8bn more in services to the UK than it imports, while the UK claims to export nearly \u00a370bn more to the US than it imports.\n\nThe UK said the exclusion of the Crown Dependencies from the UK trade data is in line with the European System of Accounts.\n\nThe US Statistics Office said it \u201cwill explore the feasibility of modifying its data collection instruments to exclude these dependencies from its geographic definition of the United Kingdom\u201d. This is something many UK officials might not want to happen just yet.\n\nAn analysis by HM Revenue & Customs into US-UK trade asymmetries on vehicles does seem to not settle the issue.\n\nBefore 2022, US-origin goods that cleared EU customs in another EU country before coming to the UK were counted as European imports. This makes it harder to compare with US data.\n\n\u201cThis explains the negative asymmetry,\u201d the analysis stated.\n\nThe study refers to negative asymmetries when US exports of vehicles to the UK are larger than the corresponding UK imports from the US.\n\nFrom 2022, UK imports from the US on a country-of-origin basis should be comparable with US exports to the UK. \u201cInstead, there is positive asymmetry in 2022, which cannot be explained,\u201d concluded the analysis.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b7c434eb-e634-44a7-9997-4781196f6638"}, {"title": "Retirees can struggle to shift the \u2018saver mindset\u2019", "description": "Spend or save is a tricky balancing act as we age", "author": "Moira O'Neill", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.744Z", "content": "After a lifetime of being a responsible saver, perhaps denying yourself luxuries in the pursuit of a comfortable retirement, your hard work has paid off. Your pension can provide a more than comfortable investment income. Plus, your calculations (often with the reassurance of a financial adviser) tell you that there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll run out of money. Yet spending still scares you.\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem? It\u2019s not maths, it\u2019s psychology. And it can have a pernicious and damaging effect on the experience of retirement.\n\nFinancial advisers say navigating the change in mindset from saver to spender is a challenge many clients are unprepared for. A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found around age 62, more than half of the sample have incomes higher than expenditure, and this figure increases to about 80 per cent by the end of retirement.\n\n\u201cIt is incredibly common to work with clients who have more than enough wealth to last them their lifetime, if not several, yet most feel at some level that they may still run out of money,\u201d says Katherine Waller, co-founder of wealth manager Six Degrees.\n\nOne problem is the preconditioning that comes through a savings habit lasting 30 to 40 years. Dan Haylett, director of TFP Financial Planning, says: \u201cWe\u2019re spoon fed saving and associate money in the bank with security. But in a modern retirement we need to flick the switch to spending.\u201d\n\nAnother issue is that there are no retirement \u201crole models\u201d to learn from. People retiring now have a very different experience to that of their parents and grandparents. Someone with a defined benefit pension retiring 25 years ago went from a regular income through their work salary to another secure guaranteed (albeit lower) income through the pension scheme. \u201cWe\u2019re now going from income, to no income and a pot of money that we have to deplete intentionally,\u201d says Haylett. \u201cAlso, that\u2019s a pot of money that gives us social status and a feeling of achievement. The sense of loss from spending it is huge in modern day retirement. People struggle with it.\u201d\n\nVicky Reynal is a psychotherapist who focuses on people\u2019s relationship with money. When it is hard to shift from saving to spending, she says it might be because saving was a psychological defence against negative feelings. \u201cChanging our behaviour could leave us feeling too vulnerable or unable to manage the emotions that emerge as we try to spend our hard-earned money,\u201d she says.\n\nMost experts cite childhood as a key influence. It doesn\u2019t matter how old we are, our spending is still influenced hugely by what we\u2019ve observed when growing up. Haylett says: \u201cThere\u2019s no blueprint if you look to parents or grandparents. For them, frugality was a badge of honour.\u201d\n\nIn the worst cases, the emotions preventing spending may be strong feelings of anxiety and fear. \u201cSome people\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. cling anxiously to every penny just in case a catastrophic \u2014 and unrealistic \u2014 series of events could materialise,\u201d says Reynal. \u201cSpending threatens a sense of security and evokes almost primal fears.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, people often overestimate how long they\u2019ll live, says Haylett. \u201cIf you\u2019ve had four aunts live to 101, I get it. But not many people know someone aged 100. I think the idea of a 100-year life is completely ruining people\u2019s retirement.\u201d\n\nIn the UK, people aged 65 can expect to live on average a further 19.7 years for men and 22.0 years for women, according to ONS data. This is projected to rise to 21.9 years for males and 24.1 years for females aged 65 years in 2045.\n\nOne way is to think of money left behind after death as a \u201clost opportunity\u201d. Haylett says: \u201cIf I fast forward 20-30 years and you still have 70 per cent of your net wealth on the table, people say it feels stupid and they have missed out.\u201d The potential for the government to tax it at the end is another incentive to spend and enjoy it now.\n\nBut the balance is difficult to get right, especially since advisers disagree on whether retirement spending should follow a U-shaped path or a straight line.\n\nMany advisers talk about the three phases of a 30-year retirement, roughly divided into 10 years each. First is \u201cgo-go\u201d, when people have lots of energy and may want to explore the world and spend money. Then comes \u201cslow-go\u201d, when spending slows. Finally, they enter the \u201cno-go\u201d, or resting years, when health may be poor. Spending is higher at the start and at the end too, if long-term care is needed.\n\nThe prospect of a large care bill at the end of life is what most people\u2019s anxiety centres around. \u201cPeople usually want a back-up plan in place,\u201d says Waller.\n\nThis is often your housing wealth. But it might also include gifting to family in tiers, holding some gifts back for later in retirement. Or using a gift and loan trust, where you can have access to the capital, but won\u2019t benefit from any investment growth.\n\nAnalysis by Interactive Investor, an investment platform, shows that someone living until age 100 could need an extra \u00a3260,000 pension wealth to give them a comfortable retirement, compared with someone who lives until 83 years old. The average nursing home costs around \u00a361,000 each year, so two years in a care home could cost around \u00a3122,000.\n\nDoug Brodie, founder and chief executive of Chancery Lane Retirement Income Planning, disputes the fact that spending is higher at the start of retirement. While some of his clients plan to spend an extra \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000 a year on holidays in the early years of retirement, he says in every single case he\u2019s found they don\u2019t. He puts this down to lifestyle being fixed by the time they reach retirement. \u201cIf you have all the time on your hands, would you go and spend a week living in a fancy hotel in Paris? Most people say \u2018that\u2019s not the lifestyle that makes me feel comfortable.\u2019 You\u2019ve spent 40 years embedding your lifestyle with kids, family and local relationships.\u201d\n\nMore often than not, Reynal says the feeling evoked around spending is guilt, either over its profligacy or the fact that money spent on themselves will reduce the amount their children inherit. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s the guilt of not having been better parents emotionally,\u201d she says.\n\nAll advisers agree that it\u2019s important to try to identify these unconscious discomforts \u2014 and this can be done in conversation with family or a trusted adviser. \u201cTalking can be emotive but writing it down or seeing it in writing can be different,\u201d says Waller.\n\nMoira O\u2019Neill is a freelance money and investment writer.

Following the Budget in October, this has changed to \u201cspend your pension before Rachel Reeves does.\u201d\n\nInheritance tax will be extended to unspent pension pots from 2027 \u2014 prompting the well-advised wealthy to have a radical rethink of their retirement plans. Whether retirees opt to take money out of pensions and spend it, gift it to the next generation or leave it where it is, it is set to be a \u201cgold mine\u201d for the Treasury, generating \u00a340bn in additional taxes over the next two decades, according to former pensions minister Sir Steve Webb.\n\nThis will be music to the ears of whoever might be chancellor by the year 2030 (I bet it won\u2019t be Reeves) when tax revenues from this change are predicted to accelerate. But could behavioural changes offer a near-term boost for the property market and the consumer economy?\n\nWebb is well placed to calculate the potential upside. Now a partner at consultancy LCP, he has based his estimate on the huge number of final salary pensions that were transferred out of defined benefit schemes between 2015-2020, typically by men in their late 50s working for blue-chip companies.\n\nThe era of ultra-low interest rates ensured high transfer values, tempting over 100,000 retirees to trade the security of an income that would die with them for a more flexible investment pot they could pass to their heirs free of IHT (and in some cases, free of income tax) \u2014 until now.\n\nSpouses and civil partners aside, from 2027 anyone inheriting a pension pot could have to pay IHT and income tax at their highest marginal rate. To avoid this \u201cdouble taxation\u201d, financial advisers and their clients are weighing up the merits of upping pension withdrawals. These would be subject to income tax, but prudent use of gifting allowances (including the so-called \u201cseven year rule\u201d) could lessen IHT liability, or remove it altogether.\n\nGifting property deposits to children or grandchildren will be the first thought for many. Last year, the bank of mum and dad spent \u00a39.2bn supporting 335,000 house purchases in the UK, according to Legal & General, with almost half of buyers under 35 receiving family assistance. If this ratio rises as Reeves tweaks mortgage affordability for first-time buyers, it could boost property prices and stamp duty revenues.\n\nDavid Hearne, a chartered financial planner at FPP, says the measures will reshape the great generational wealth transfer. Many of his clients are now considering making regular pension withdrawals (incurring income tax on the way out) and funding pension contributions for their adult children, who will receive tax relief and employer contributions on the way in.\n\nHe predicts equity release to extract value from the family home will be a popular tool. Money taken that way can be spent or gifted, with debts reducing the value of the estate and lessening the sting of IHT bills.\n\nTo encourage wealthy retirees to spend and enjoy their money, Hearne keeps a big reel of 40-per-cent-off stickers on his desk as a conversation starter. \u201cSpending \u00a320,000 on the trip of a lifetime could be seen as only costing \u00a312,000 as the money won\u2019t be subject to 40 per cent IHT when you die,\u201d he says.\n\nAs advisers and their clients rejig plans, could this pulling forward of spending help to turbo-charge VAT receipts and boost the lacklustre UK economy?\n\nDespite LCP\u2019s punchy predictions, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, has doubts. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge difference for the overall economy\u201d, he says, \u201calthough it could be for individuals or their heirs.\u201d\n\nMuch will come down to timing. If retirees pull more out of pension pots sooner than expected, this will reduce their spending power in later years. And while the wealthiest can spend (or gift) with confidence, the biggest worry for those less affluent is balancing investment risk against longevity risk.\n\nThose in my own circle who netted tidy sums by transferring their defined benefit pension into a Sipp have had a nerve-racking week as DeepSeek roiled global stock markets.\n\nRun down the pension too much, and they risk running out of money in retirement. Plus, they will have given up any spousal benefits in their defined benefit scheme and will need to provide enough for a surviving partner. This, and the lottery of care costs, could be a brake on spending and gifting.\n\nDifficult choices lie ahead. But with more than half of all those retiring between now and 2060 forecast not to be saving anywhere near enough, these are nice problems to have.\n\nClaer Barrett is the FT\u2019s consumer editor and author of the FT\u2019s Sort Your Financial Life Out newsletter series; claer.barrett@ft.com; Instagram and TikTok @ClaerB\n\nclaer.barrett@ft.com", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0093bbce-ea65-4488-9b0c-9f79836ac08e"}, {"title": "Britain must decide if it is to remain a serious player on defence", "description": "Fiscal constraints put Starmer and Reeves in an unenviable situation, but Trump has changed the terms of the debate", "author": "Camilla Cavendish", "published_date": "2025-01-31T18:00:15.102Z", "content": "Mercurial Donald Trump may be, but he has a gift for shifting the debate. And sometimes, he is right. When it comes to defence spending, the only surprise is how long Europe\u2019s Nato members have managed to freeride on American taxpayers.\n\nEurope is rearming, and not only because of the fear that Trump will call for members to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence at Nato\u2019s June summit. Russia\u2019s nuclear rhetoric, cyber attacks, the sabotage of undersea cables in the Baltic Sea and China\u2019s vast new military command centre demonstrate that, as Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, said last year, \u201cthe world has got rougher\u201d.\n\nRussia\u2019s neighbours have been upping their game for some time. Poland\u2019s military outlay is already 4 per cent of GDP and its armed forces are now the third biggest in Nato. In Sweden, every household recently received a government leaflet, \u201cIn Case of Crisis or War\u201d, advising on emergency evacuation and how to store food if power fails.\n\nIn Britain, the threat still feels remote. The government refuses to say when it will meet its target of raising defence spending from 2.3 per cent to 2.5 per cent, fearing unpopular deep cuts elsewhere.\u00a0But time is not on its side.\n\nThe UK still has a good story to tell. Our special forces, our intelligence services and our nuclear deterrent are a strong card for London in its relationships with Brussels and Washington. We play a leadership role in the Joint Expeditionary Force of northern and eastern European Nato members, we provide nuclear attack submarines to Australia through the Aukus partnership with the US and we are part of the Global Combat Air Partnership to build a next-generation warplane, with Italy and Japan.\n\nWithout commensurate funding, however, these involvements accelerate overstretch. Defence experts repeat the phrase \u201chollowed out\u201d. Britain is relying on shiny totemic kit \u2014 its aircraft carriers and Trident \u2014 to project a level of underlying muscle that it no longer has.\n\nEven the 2.3 per cent is not quite what it seems, since it includes pensions. New \u201chunter killer\u201d submarines have been stuck in port because of a lack of repair docks. General Sir Patrick Sanders, former chief of the general staff, has warned that Britain is no longer capable of launching the kind of operation it did in southern Iraq in 2003. The defence select committee complained a year ago that it could not even adequately judge Britain\u2019s readiness, because the Ministry of Defence is so much more secretive than Nato allies.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is waiting for the strategic defence review in the spring. The reviewers include Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser once described by Trump as \u201ca deep state stiff with a nice accent\u201d (she hails from County Durham). Hill knows better than most that Trump takes a maximalist position. Her memoir quotes the president, in his first term, complaining that advisers who criticised his threats to leave Nato were \u201cruining my leverage\u201d.\n\nBut even if Trump settles for more like 3.5 per cent, the UK is still in a fix. Starmer needs to decide, now, what spending envelope to give the reviewers. Some Labour backbenchers have warned that dithering is a grave mistake. Not all MPs or voters would support cutting transport, say, to fund defence. But few would want to see Britain let down Ukraine, after all we have done.\n\nBritain now faces an existential question: are we going to remain a serious player or be exposed as a Potemkin power, talking a big game while resources dwindle? There is always disagreement behind the scenes on whether we should be fighting \u201cthe last war\u201d or the next one. But the experience in Ukraine suggests winning requires both cutting-edge technology and conventional weapons, not one or the other. And that mass matters: in terms of troops, tanks and artillery. The ceasefire envisaged by Marco Rubio, US secretary of state, is likely to require America\u2019s European allies to help maintain a frozen zone between Ukraine and Russia, perhaps for some time.\n\nThere are always tensions, too, between the different armed services. But without a bigger fiscal envelope, it is unlikely that Britain can continue to be a serious player on both land and sea.\n\nThe fiscal constraints make this a hellish situation for the government. Chancellor Rachel Reeves didn\u2019t mention defence this week in her speech on growth, but it is a core part of the industrial strategy, and rightly so. Although the ministry of defence does not publish a complete analysis of where it sources weaponry, we know that parts of the F-35 fighter jets are being made here. The Typhoon weapons system, according to BAE Systems, has contributed \u00a31.4bn to the UK economy\u00a0in export sales. The industry supports an ecosystem of suppliers which contribute to regeneration.\n\nBehind the scenes, there has been lobbying for both London and Brussels to exempt defence from fiscal rules on national security grounds \u2014 this seems unlikely to appeal to Reeves.\n\nBut there is yet another challenge brewing, from calls to boycott the defence industry. In 2020, the Supreme Court over-ruled the then Conservative government\u2019s attempts to stop the Local Government Pension Scheme divesting from defence, after an action brought by the Palestine Solidarity campaign. A number of local authorities have dumped defence stocks.\n\nSuccessive governments have performed a delicate dance of the veils on defence, trying to maintain prestige while fudging resources. But now the music has stopped. The decision that Reeves and Starmer make in the coming months will have an impact on the UK\u2019s alliances, our perceived position in the world, and our perception of ourselves.\n\ncamilla.cavendish@ft.com", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/74ea2a31-c023-4aa8-a103-e42dae3528d5"}, {"title": "What\u2019s behind the boom in car parking charge tickets?", "description": "The industry, which has attracted lots of private equity investment, is becoming increasingly punitive", "author": "Alistair Gray", "published_date": "2025-01-31T12:33:46.864Z", "content": "Parking in the UK has become a major annoyance for drivers. There are the fiddly apps, the cashless machines that never seem to work and the ever-increasing rates. Fall foul of the rules and you can expect a parking charge notice to be posted through your door within days.\n\nMotorists have taken to online message boards to rail against what they see as profiteering, alleging unfair fees, confusing signage and heavy-handed enforcement, with many believing the process has become more vindictive in recent years.\n\nDrivers are certainly getting more fines. In the 2023-24 tax year, private car park operators handed out a record near-13mn parking charge notices. In the six months to last October, they were being issued at a rate of one every two seconds.\n\nPrivate parking companies have grown rapidly over the past decade and now manage more than 50,000 sites across the UK, up fivefold from 2012, according to the International Parking Community (IPC), a trade body. Over the same period, penalty ticket issuance has skyrocketed, rising more than eightfold.\n\nOperators say their growth has been commensurate with a rise in demand for parking spaces and an increase in the number of people repeatedly flouting the rules.\n\nWill Hurley, chief executive of the IPC, is keen to point out that most people pay for their parking without incident \u2014 99.77 per cent of \u201cparking events\u201d are \u201cseamless\u201d, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely right that we look to improve,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut unfortunately the sector only gets talked about when something goes wrong.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s a sector that has enjoyed bumper profits recently. Seven of the UK\u2019s top 10 largest private car park operators have brought in record operating profits in the last three years, according to a Financial Times analysis of Companies House filings.\n\nThe industry has also undergone significant change. A wave of takeovers since 2017 has brought most of the biggest players under the ultimate ownership of private equity groups such as Wall Street behemoth KKR.\n\nHurley claims that, across the industry, the money from \u201cpaid-for parking\u201d far exceeds that from \u201cenforcement\u201d. That isn\u2019t true of every car park operator. In its latest accounts, ParkingEye, the fifth-largest operator by revenue, claims it earns most of its turnover \u201cfrom the issue of parking charge notices\u201d. Smart Parking, the UK\u2019s 11th largest car park operator, earned almost 90 per cent of its global revenue last year \u2014 the majority of which originated in the UK \u2014 from issuing penalty tickets, according to its 2024 annual report.\n\nMost of the top 10 did not respond when contacted by the FT. National Car Parks, the largest operator, declined to comment and Q-Park, the second largest, says it operates barriered facilities and does not issue parking tickets. Apcoa says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of its income is \u201cderived from client management fees where we do not take a share from parking/penalty charge notices\u201d. (Creative Car Park, NCP and Q-Park have not achieved record profits in the past three years.)\n\nAlthough often described as parking \u201cfines\u201d, the tickets issued by private companies are technically parking charge notices, invoices that allege a motorist breached the contract to which they implicitly agreed by parking on private land.\n\nOnly local authorities can issue fines, says Scott Dixon, a consumer advocate and founder of The Complaints Resolver blog. Parking charge notices often \u201clook the same [as local authority tickets] and that [means] most motorists see them as fines to pay off as soon as possible,\u201d he explains.\n\nMore than 80 per cent of paid parking charge notices are settled soon after they are issued, according to a submission to parliament by Euro Car Parks. Those who have paid the charges generally aren\u2019t allowed to appeal them subsequently.\n\nParking companies can obtain car owners\u2019 details from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), which sells them on request to approved members of the parking industry\u2019s two trade associations \u2014 the British Parking Association and the IPC. Last year, the DVLA netted at least \u00a331.9mn from the practice. The RAC Foundation, a think-tank, uses the number of vehicle keeper requests made by car park management companies as a proxy for the number of penalty tickets issued \u2014 and FT Money has done the same.\n\nSo how did we get here? Many consider the original sin to be the ban on vehicle clamping on private land, introduced by the government in 2012.\n\nAccording to Hurley, the lack of deterrent resulted in many more people breaking the rules. Others disagree.\n\nSteve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, says: \u201cWhat no one foresaw [in 2012] was the scale at which parking firms would subsequently go after registered keepers. A big part of the issue is that cheap camera technology and ready access to DVLA data means pursuing car owners to \u2018enforce\u2019 parking offences is less expensive than driving around to apply wheel clamps used to be.\u201d\n\nThere have been numerous calls for reform. In 2022, the government attempted to regulate the industry and impose a \u00a350 cap on most charges. That year, car park operators launched multiple legal challenges, leading the government to withdraw its proposals.\n\nLast October, the industry set up its own code of conduct and in January 2025 formed a new panel \u2014 that it claims is independent \u2014 to oversee it.\n\nHurley, whose IPC organisation was not involved in 2022\u2019s legal challenges, says: \u201cWhat I want to achieve is for people to read the signage, follow the signage and then avoid a parking charge, because ultimately it\u2019s really easy not to get a parking charge if you\u2019re told how to avoid it.\u201d\n\nThe first item on the new panel\u2019s agenda was to stop motorists being penalised for taking more than five minutes to pay for parking.\n\nIn December, Excel Parking dropped its court claim against Rosey Hudson, a 31-year old from Leicestershire, whom it had charged nearly \u00a32,000 in accumulated penalty tickets. Her case, disputed by Excel, was that she was delayed in paying for her parking on multiple occasions due to a poor mobile phone signal when trying to use the car park\u2019s app.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2024, Excel Parking tripled its operating profits to \u00a35.1mn and last year its operating margin stood at 28 per cent, the highest level since it started filing public accounts. Owner and founder Simon Renshaw-Smith was paid a dividend of \u00a3522,000 last year on top of at least \u00a3150,000 for his role as a director. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExcel has nearly halved its headcount since 2017 and slashed its wage bill by over a third, according to its 2024 annual report.\n\n\u201cWe need parking to support our high streets, towns and city centres, but something is clearly going wrong,\u201d says Catherine Atkinson, the Labour MP for Derby North, who has raised the issue of unfair parking charges in parliament.\n\nShe says that many of her constituents paid for parking but had received parking charge notices for exceeding grace periods allowed by car park operators. \u201cFor a lot of people, it\u2019s been because they\u2019ve been older or assisting others, or they\u2019ve really struggled with [parking payment] apps and broken machines.\u201d\n\nAtkinson called for \u201can independently set code of practice\u201d and says she will broach the subject with parking executives at a roundtable in February.\n\nBack when the government tried to set new rules for the sector, parking companies made the argument that a full impact assessment had not been carried out. A survey by audit firm Mazars on behalf of the BPA argued that the government\u2019s fee caps would bankrupt almost half of private car park operators affiliated with the trade body within a year.\n\nSpeaking to MPs in 2021, Philip Boynes, chief executive of ParkingEye, said the drop in revenues resulting from the changes would be \u201cunsustainable\u201d without significant cost-cutting and job losses.\n\nBoynes told the MPs that the \u201caverage profit of a car parking operator was about 2.1 per cent\u201d, citing a report by IbisWorld.\n\nThe FT\u2019s analysis shows that ParkingEye\u2019s operating margin that year was 15 per cent, up from 5 per cent in 2020. From 2015 onwards, aside from the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, the company\u2019s margins have remained above 20 per cent.\n\nBoynes did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nParkingEye issued roughly one in five of all UK parking charge notices last year. It is owned by the world\u2019s largest infrastructure investor, Macquarie, which previously owned distressed utility provider Thames Water. ParkingEye manages car parks for clients ranging from McDonald\u2019s to the NHS.\n\nIn 2023 the company made an operating profit of \u00a315.5mn from revenues of \u00a357.5mn \u2014 a margin of 27 per cent.\n\nParkingEye says it \u201coperates responsibly and fairly\u201d. The company adds its growth has \u201cbeen in response to the increase in demand [from] landowners who wish to ensure an increasing motorist population can access [facilities] that might otherwise become congested by non-compliant motorists who misuse the parking facilities\u201d.\n\nThe industry\u2019s own code of conduct, which came into effect last year, was largely similar to the government\u2019s original, but omitted the proposed \u00a350 cap on parking charge notices and restrictions on debt recovery fees.\n\nAt the time, the RAC Foundation said the industry\u2019s code \u201cconveniently avoided some of the biggest issues [that] badly need[ed] to be addressed to prevent drivers being taken advantage of.\u201d\n\nSir Greg Knight, the former Conservative MP who introduced legislation to regulate the sector, is urging the new government to \u201ctake up the gauntlet\u201d and introduce a \u201cnational parking code\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe present situation is highly unsatisfactory; parking companies are in effect policing their own rules,\u201d he says. \u201cThe threat of legal action was unfortunate, but the government appears to have let this matter drift.\u201d\n\nThe government says it is \u201cdetermined\u201d to protect motorists and \u201cdrive up standards in the industry\u201d. It adds that it will \u201cset out further details on the private parking code of practice as soon as possible\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn my book, this is unfinished business,\u201d says Knight.\n\nAdditional reporting by Alistair Gray.

On the North Downs Way, just outside Sevenoaks and 20 miles from the centre of London, a dog-walker pauses and steps to one side of the narrow, muddy path to make space for a group of young people coming the other way. But a strange thing happens. As the man and the dog wait, the people just keep coming \u2014 two or three abreast, all seemingly in their 20s, smiling and chatting animatedly as they pour out of the woods along the path, a gregarious Gen-Z column almost 400-people strong.\n\nThough he didn\u2019t know it, the man was witnessing the latest outing of Overground, one of a new breed of walking groups that is taking an activity previously associated with sedate middle-age and reinventing it for a Gen-Z and millennial audience. Information is shared on TikTok and Instagram, and the groups often meet in the Home Counties or within a short train ride of other major cities.\n\nFor many of the organisers, it\u2019s about building community, harnessing the mental-health benefits of spending time in nature, encouraging participation from under-represented groups and getting away from hectic city lives. And for an increasingly sober demographic, the early starts on weekend mornings are no problem.\n\nBefore starting their hiking group Dykes Who Hike in March 2024, neither Lucy Cooper nor Yas Message had been big hikers. \u201cWe wanted to see more of the countryside whilst making new connections. . . without relying on alcohol,\u201d says Cooper.\n\nWhen the pair advertised their first hike on social media, the \u201cSeven Sisters walk\u201d from Seaford to Eastbourne, 60 people turned up. When 250 turned up for their second, they realised they might need to formalise a ticketing system to avoid hikes becoming \u201ctoo intimidating for people to enjoy\u201d. Tickets now cost \u00a32, and all 200 spaces typically sell out in minutes; in the past year, new branches have sprouted in Manchester, Leeds, Shropshire and Birmingham.\n\nLast weekend I joined another new group, the Adventure Girls Club, meeting up with 12 women and two dogs at Bath station for a foray into the Downs. \u201cThe [traditional] hiking community can often focus on hiking the farthest, fastest or the most challenging route,\u201d says the group\u2019s founder Alice Keegan, \u201cwhereas I love to hike slowly, take in the views, notice the nature around me \u2014 a more mindful approach.\u201d\n\nKeegan, a qualified mountain leader, used to live in London\u2019s bustling Bethnal Green and work as creative director of a design agency catering to the music industry. Feeling burnt out, she took herself solo hiking in the Lake District and began to appreciate how beneficial the outdoors was for her mental health. Now she wants to support others to \u201cescape the stress of modern living\u201d.\n\nWe file out of town and wind up steep woodland footpaths towards Sham Castle, built in 1762 for Ralph Allen, one of the key figures in Bath\u2019s Georgian revival. As we meander through Smallcombe Wood, Keegan points out species of fungi including the frills of a turkey tail, and the black bulbs of King Alfred\u2019s cakes.\n\nBut if connecting with nature is a key obsession, it is the digital world that is enabling these new communities. Lauren La Faci, TikTok\u2019s London-based consumer communications lead, says that \u201cin recent months, hiking enthusiasts have been captivating millions with stunning landscapes and hiking tutorials\u201d. On the platform, #hiking has 5mn posts (and #hiketok has 270,000). In comparison, #swimming manages 2.1mn posts.\n\nFor Jeb Jagne, who founded Overground in July 2023, \u201cwalking became a way of taking a breather and a way to decompress\u201d after suffering a bereavement, relationship breakup and job loss within the course of a few months. Overground hosts monthly walks within an hour\u2019s train journey of the capital. On their first, 43 people showed up; now there can be as many as 500.\n\nThe walks are free and non-ticketed which means the organisers can\u2019t limit numbers. \u201cThere are already so many barriers when it comes to finding space in the outdoors, I wouldn\u2019t want to introduce another one,\u201d says Jagne. Overground is now fundraising to set up a training programme for people from marginalised groups to become mountain guides.\n\nJagne, who previously worked as a DJ and nightclub promoter, has been sober for the past year. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people meet at Overground and form solid friendships, move into new homes and even go on holiday together. The walks will always be our North Star but what really matters is being that first domino in forming a new connection.\u201d\n\nBack in Bath, 13km trodden and legs aching, the Adventure Girls Club troops back to the train station. The group splits, exchanging social-media contacts and \u201cnice to meet you\u2019s\u201d, returning to suburbia with new friendships forged \u2014 if a little muddier than four hours earlier.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/57e944be-a071-437f-8785-80b8d8c8ee3c"}, {"title": "New donations to FT charity appeal to be match-funded after deadline extended", "description": "Rosetrees Trust will match gifts to help reach new \u00a3200,000 target", "author": "Patrick Jenkins", "published_date": "2025-01-30T13:15:51.365Z", "content": "Thanks to your generosity, the FT\u2019s joint seasonal appeal in aid of Financial Literacy and Inclusion Campaign \u201cFLIC\u201d and school food charity Magic Breakfast has now reached its baseline target of raising \u00a3100,000.\n\nThe appeal, which was launched in early December, was due to close at the end of this week. But we are now extending the deadline by a week, until Friday February 7, thanks to a late intervention from the Rosetrees Trust, which has generously offered to match-fund donations to get us to a new \u00a3200,000 target.\n\nThe offer is only valuable if readers donate.

We are also supporting research that is looking at the mental health problems of young people, which [is] growing for a variety of reasons.\u201d Financial stress, often compounded by gaps in foundational financial understanding, is a proven contributor to mental health problems.\n\nRoss, whose charity is a leading backer of \u201cventure philanthropy\u201d in the area of medical research, is convinced of the related relevance of the FT\u2019s appeal and is a passionate advocate for a broader push to increase philanthropy. \u201cPeople who are well provided [for] financially should contribute to the needs of others,\u201d he said.\n\nRoss\u2019s family fortune stems from his parents\u2019 multiple business start-ups, which range from a market stall to a property investment empire. That wealth once topped \u00a3100mn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, but Ross has since given away a large portion of it.

But London-based Andy, 79, is not one of them. He and his wife do not plan to leave their four adult children an inheritance. Instead, the couple have spent what\u2019s left of their funds, sailing and travelling the world before they \u201cpop their clogs\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about equality of opportunity and fairness. It seems unfair that some kids get huge assistance while others get nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re arranging our finances so they have just enough to bury us.\u201d\n\nAndy, who asked us not to use his surname, worked in public education and retired in his early 50s. He says he\u2019s politically \u201cleftwing-ish\u201d, but his views aren\u2019t just about politics \u2014 it\u2019s also a question of parenting.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a helicopter parent\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I hate when I see kids who are 40 and their parents are still looking after them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a noteworthy stance, given the monumental wealth transfer that\u2019s expected globally over the next few decades. A record \u00a35.5tn in wealth is due to be transferred to the next generation in the UK alone. With over 90 per cent of the country\u2019s wealth currently held by Generations X and older, many Boomers and millennials are set to become \u201cinheritance millionaires\u201d.\n\nYet Andy is not entirely alone. In the US, a 2015 survey by HSBC found that one in four Americans planned to spend their money rather than pass it down, a phenomenon known as SKIs \u2014 \u201cspending the kids\u2019 inheritance\u201d. A Hargreaves Lansdown survey in 2021 found around 11 per cent of parents in England choose not to leave an inheritance to their families.\u00a0(In Scotland, there are \u201cforced heirship\u201d rules.)\n\nTheir motivations range from hedonism (wanting to spend the money themselves), not wanting to spoil their children, or philanthropy. Others \u2014 such as actor Daniel Craig \u2014 say they simply find the concept of an inheritance \u201cdistasteful\u201d.\n\nI should mention here that my own parents also belong to this contrarian group. Since as early as I can remember, I\u2019ve known they don\u2019t believe in leaving a large inheritance \u2014 something my dad has spoken publicly about himself. They have instead pledged the overwhelming majority of their wealth to their charity, The Safer Roads Foundation, along with other humanitarian causes.\n\nThe Bank of Mum of Dad has taken excellent care of my sibling and me (including generously paying off our student loans, and allocating funds for a future deposit on a flat \u2014 both immense gifts, and more than many will receive in inheritance). So now, it\u2019s pretty much closed for business.\n\nTo be clear, they haven\u2019t cut us out in anger. Nor are they Marxists \u2014 politically they\u2019re pretty centrist. They simply feel that there are life-saving causes that will benefit from their money more than their two well-educated adult children.\n\nRenaissance philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli once wrote that \u201cA son can bear the loss of his father\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. but the loss of his inheritance may drive him to despair.\u201d For anyone wondering if I\u2019ve succumbed to despondency, fear not: I\u2019m genuinely proud of my parents\u2019 legacy. I feel incredibly fortunate for the support I\u2019ve had during their lifetime. There\u2019s a silver lining too, in that I won\u2019t be at risk of any familial angst once they die (40\u00a0per cent of people report conflict over inheritances).\n\nIf anything, I\u2019m intrigued as to why it\u2019s so provocative, especially among their peers. On the rare occasions that it\u2019s come up, I\u2019ve encountered shock or thinly veiled criticism of my parents. Sometimes I\u2019m met with reassurance that I am in fact in their will and this is a motivational ploy (I checked. If it is a bluff, they\u2019re not breaking the act yet).\n\nAndy also says his friends have been critical of his stance. That\u2019s despite all his children \u201clanding on their feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are horrified,\u201d he says. \u201cThat includes my well-balanced friends\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009They can\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nOnline forums froth with furious commentators wondering how people can \u201cwatch their kids living in a \u2018hole\u2019 while they go and enjoy their cruises.\u201d Anonymous op-eds voice dismay over parents \u201cselfishly\u201d spending their inheritance. There is near delirium each time a member of the super-rich \u2014 including Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg \u2014 publicly vows not to leave their wealth to their offspring. Sure, there\u2019s being charitable, they say, but to such extremes?\n\nFundamentally, wanting to shrink your children\u2019s inheritance is seen as counter to the primitive desire to protect one\u2019s offspring \u2014 no matter how well off they are. The majority of people are dedicated to hoarding for their family, with more than \u00a3100bn inherited and gifted in the UK alone each year, according to Demos, a think-tank.\n\n\u201cTaking care of the kids is the cultural norm. So it\u2019s countercultural if you will,\u201d says psychology professor Janet Reibstein and author of Good Relations. \u201cIt\u2019s seen as neglecting the natural role of parent and child.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a luxury itself to contemplate trimming your will, given many families are scared they won\u2019t get a choice amid rising social costs. Fewer than 30 per cent of Brits expect to benefit \u2014 or have benefited from \u2014 an inheritance, according to a 2022 YouGov poll. The ONS reported that the median inheritance for those who received one was \u00a311,000 (this excludes lifetime gifts), and on average occurs in one\u2019s 60s.\n\nIndeed, political interventions that limit the wealth that\u2019s passed down tend to\u00a0spark controversy, including recent reforms to UK inheritance tax (IHT), often described as \u201cBritain\u2019s most hated tax\u201d. Today, around 4 per cent\u00a0of estates are affected by IHT \u2014\u00a0charged at 40 per cent\u00a0on any part of an estate worth over \u00a3325,000 (or over \u00a31mn\u00a0when a main residence is passed down to children and reliefs are pooled with a spouse). The decision to include pension wealth within the scope of IHT from 2027 has come under fire from some corners of the media, while ending the exemption of agricultural property from IHT caused farmers to march on Downing Street.\n\nInheritance naysayers have a simple argument: lots of money isn\u2019t always the best thing for us. It can damage people \u2014 and wealthy kids need specific guardrails, a theory exposed by the Carnegie Conjecture, which holds that people receiving a substantial inheritance are much more likely to leave the workforce. The party line is that guardrails are crucial, whether parents are handing over life-changing amounts or just a generous leftover that might ease their children\u2019s paths.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s tough love.\n\nJoe Reilly, an adviser to US family offices and host of The Inheritance Podcast, says too much money is a real concern.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a source of anxiety for parents, knowing their children are growing up in affluence\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It can impede their search for internal meaning,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cWealth doesn\u2019t have to deprive motivation, but getting rid of all the challenges does.\u201d\n\nSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says hyper-successful entrepreneurs in particular want their children to make their own way (though this is softened with substantial gifts during their parents\u2019 lifetime).\n\nPart of the issue, according to Reilly, is that inheritance was historically reserved for the aristocratic class, who would reserve \u201ca lot of time and effort\u201d learning to adapt to a big wealth influx, including focusing on public service \u2014 though many still squandered it. Today, inheritance comes to broad swaths of the middle class, who have little or no training.\n\nReceiving a hefty inheritance can come with real baggage, says author Eliza Filby. In her book, Inheritocracy she cites several examples of people who inherited large sums who felt guilt, and a loss of meaning. There\u2019s a danger of \u201ceconomically infantilising\u201d your offspring too, she says, especially in light of the \u201cnepo baby\u201d debate.\n\nTo counter this, family office adviser Elena Nu\u00f1ez Cooper works with clients to adopt a policy of \u201csevere responsibility\u201d with their children. This includes teaching them tough financial lessons from a young age and training them to be philanthropists. It also means managing rich people\u2019s funds so they \u201cdie with zero\u201d, with the majority allocated to a charitable foundation \u2014 ideally led by their conscientious, financially savvy children.\n\n\u201cKids do not benefit from an attitude of \u2018you\u2019re going to inherit later\u2019,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez says. \u201cI work with the children of billionaires who have everything, and they\u2019re a lot worse off in the long run.\u201d\n\nFor parents it can be a big ideological step to consider trimming their children\u2019s or grandchildren\u2019s inheritance instead of boosting it \u2014 even if they are well set up.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps an even tougher pill to swallow for the offspring expecting to receive a chunky inheritance, says financial psychotherapist Vicky Reynal. \u201cWe all have a normal amount of greed,\u201d she says. \u201cMost people want to be wealthier.\u201d\n\nThe framing around cuts in inheritance is therefore key. This includes \u201chighlighting that it has nothing to do with not loving or caring about them,\u201d Reynal notes. Their responses may vary depending on the individual\u2019s maturity and how early on these expectations are set.\n\nProfessor Reibstein goes further. She says that families where there\u2019s little philanthropic precedent will need to work hard to rewrite their \u201cculture\u201d if they want to take this route \u2014 otherwise, \u201cyour children will feel it as a blow.\u201d\n\nHargreaves Lansdown analyst Cooper stresses that it doesn\u2019t have to be all or nothing. Simply, leaving your kids everything doesn\u2019t have to be the default.\n\n\u201cYou can think about giving them comfort without spoiling them,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of adding to their quality of life versus taking away the impetus to work.\u201d\n\nWhatever route you choose, however, experts agree: communicate your wishes early. Emotionally, being disinherited without being told can be devastating. But the other danger, Cooper says, is people can be in for a financial shock when an expected inheritance doesn\u2019t materialise.\n\n\u201cYou absolutely cannot rely on an inheritance,\u201d she warns.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to escape the fact that for many an inheritance can make an outsized difference, especially in light of rising house prices \u2014 the average first-time buyer deposit in London is now over \u00a3140,000, according to Zoopla \u2014 and diminished pensions. That includes segments of the middle class, many of whom are poorer than their parents. Inheritance is bridging that intergenerational gap, says Filby.\n\n\u201cWhether or not you\u2019re from a wealthy family\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[inheritance] is more important in determining your lifetime income than it has been in the past,\u201d says David Sturrock at the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nThe IFS forecasts inheritance will make up a record average 14 per cent of lifetime earnings for the 1980s-born generation. That means for some families, an inheritance will dictate whether they own a house, clear their debts, or can retire comfortably, Sturrock explains. In rare cases, it could be a pathway to social mobility.\n\nYet few born into the top quartile can make that argument. Statistically, most adult children in this camp will enter their 40s with a decent income and firmly on the housing ladder \u2014 often funded by historic parental gifts. A bulky inheritance in this group\u2019s case has been described as insurance against calamity, or laziness.\n\nFor Andy, this is precisely the problem.\n\nHis advice is to think about inheritance as a sporting analogy. Imagine, he says, if there was a rule in F1 whereby if you won the first race, you\u2019d do five fewer laps in the next race.

The sector is reliant on overseas students who typically pay two or three times domestic rates.\n\nOfficial data shows a more than 50 per cent drop in new EU students after Brexit, while universities increased recruitment from other markets in Asia and Africa, including India, Nigeria and Pakistan.\n\nBoris Johnson promised in 2020 that his Brexit deal would not interrupt the \u201cva-et-vient\u201d of people-to-people contacts with the EU, but in practice the intake of UK universities has shifted substantially.\n\nJamie Arrowsmith, director of Universities UK International, which represents the industry, said the changes had brought greater diversity to British campuses, but had narrowed the field of subjects studied as international students tended to favour science and business studies courses.\n\n\u201cWhile the diversity in terms of country of origin has changed, diversity in courses has been lost,\u201d he added.\n\nBrexit also saw the introduction of a points-based immigration system by Johnson\u2019s government from January 1 2021 that coincided with a massive expansion of the NHS workforce, necessitating far more overseas recruitment.\n\nMark Dayan, policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said that a government decision to lower thresholds for medical workers had led to a radical reshaping of the NHS workforce.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2023 the number of ethnic minority doctors in the NHS grew at almost 8 times the rate of white doctors, according to the General Medical Council, with arrivals from India, Pakistan, Egypt, Nigeria and the Philippines rising sharply.\n\nDayan said the challenge of integrating doctors who trained overseas into the NHS was one reason why an increase in staff numbers in recent years had not delivered a commensurate increase in productivity.\n\n\u201cAbsorbing so many new staff, many at [the] start of their careers, who are used to a different system of working, requires a lot of work on training, and introducing them to how things are done in the NHS,\u201d Dayan said.\n\nThe government is planning to train more UK doctors as well as continuing to recruit from abroad, but its red lines on free movement of workers mean that it is unlikely that EU-UK reset negotiations will see a significant increase in recruitment from the EU.\n\nBrexit was sold during the 2016 referendum campaign as the means by which the UK would \u201ctake back control\u201d of its borders, curbing both legal and illegal migration.\n\nIn the event, both surged after 2020, fuelling accusations of betrayal on the political right and helping to drive support for Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK party, which has recently drawn level with both Labour and the Conservatives in the polls.\n\nThis political splintering is the opposite of what former Tory premier David Cameron intended when he called the referendum to head off the threat posed by Farage\u2019s UK Independence Party and resolve long-standing divisions over Europe inside the Conservative party.\n\nBut Reform\u2019s rise has come despite a decline in the overall popularity of Brexit, with 58 per cent of voters now saying Brexit was the wrong decision, according to polling by the National Centre for Social Research.\n\nA \u201ckey element\u201d of this shift, according to pollster Sir John Curtice, is driven by demographic trends as older, pro-Brexit voters die off and younger voters, who were unable to vote in 2016, express their overwhelming pro-EU views.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the demographics story, the ceiling for a Farage party should be lower than 10 years ago, but Reform is more popular in 2024 than Ukip was in 2014,\u201d said Rob Ford, professor of politics at Manchester University.\n\nFord credited this counter-intuitive outcome to the platform Brexit gave Farage, and to the political opportunity offered to him by the Tories\u2019 struggle to deliver benefits from the UK\u2019s break with the EU.\n\nThe past few years have laid bare Brexit\u2019s damaging impact on business. Countries usually strike trade deals to reduce border bureaucracy, but the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement did the reverse, restoring the customs requirements that had disappeared with the advent of the EU single market.\n\nLabour has said it will not rejoin a customs union with the EU or go back into the EU single market, so trade will continue to face customs barriers.\n\nStarmer\u2019s negotiations with the EU could reduce friction for some individual sectors, such as food and drink exporters, if Labour makes good on its promise to strike a veterinary agreement with Brussels.\n\nAligning industrial standards and relinking the EU and UK carbon trading schemes could also reduce other forms of red tape, such as licensing requirements and carbon border adjustment taxes, or CBAMs.\n\nHowever a mountain of paperwork will remain. In 2023, the last year for which data is available, there were more than 41mn customs declarations for trade between the UK and the EU. The much criticised Brussels red tape became \u2018red white and blue\u2019 tape.\n\nAs a result, UK goods exports underperformed other rich-world countries, with the total value rising by just 0.3 per cent per year, compared with 4.2 per cent annually across the OECD, according to the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank.\n\nNew Brexit red tape has hit small businesses hardest, with research by the London School of Economics calculating that 16,400 firms stopped exporting to the EU after the TCA came into force.\n\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce said smaller companies had less capacity to deal with \u201cthe deluge\u201d of new bureaucracy, while larger businesses had the money and staff to adapt.\n\n\u201cExporting to the EU was often a gateway for SMEs to enter new export markets across the world, so the urgency of making border processes cheaper and simpler is clear,\u201d he added.\n\nThe BCC has urged the government to use the reset negotiations to simplify border processes and promote regulatory co-operation on customs matters, particularly as the bloc introduces new rules in the coming years.\n\nChris Southworth, secretary-general of the International Chamber of Commerce, said that given the UK\u2019s red lines the government should invest in digitising trade, using AI and improving access to trade finance in order to help business.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need TCA for any of this and it will improve EU co-operation and repair some of the damage,\u201d he added.\n\nPoll tracker by Jonathan Vincent", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4d2d78b0-eedd-485c-9a9c-4e41baf46146"}, {"title": "AstraZeneca ditches plan to build \u00a3450mn UK vaccine plant", "description": "Decision is a blow to Starmer\u2019s government after setting out pro-growth pitch to investors ", "author": "Hannah Kuchler", "published_date": "2025-01-31T16:23:59.576Z", "content": "AstraZeneca has cancelled plans for a \u00a3450mn UK vaccine manufacturing plant after months of wrangling with British officials about state support for the project, in a major blow to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s government.\n\nUK officials put forward a revised offer of financial support for the site close to Liverpool this month that was significantly higher than the \u00a340mn offered last year, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nStarmer\u2019s Labour government had initially sought last summer to reduce the amount of public money provided to the project in Speke from about \u00a390mn to \u00a340mn.\n\n\u201cFollowing protracted discussions with the government, we are no longer pursuing our planned investment at Speke,\u201d AstraZeneca said in a statement on Friday.\n\n\u201cSeveral factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government\u2019s proposal.\u201d\n\nThe new plant was going to make the next generation of flu vaccines and help the UK be more resilient in future pandemics.\n\nThe existing Speke site will continue to produce and supply a flu vaccine, said AstraZeneca, the largest UK-listed company by market capitalisation.\n\nThe decision comes just days after chancellor Rachel Reeves sought to position the UK as a highly attractive place for life science companies to invest in a major speech on growth.\n\nStarmer and Reeves have faced criticism from business for their \u00a340bn tax-raising Budget last year and other measures including stronger worker rights, which executives have warned will make the UK a less attractive place to invest.\n\nThe UK\u2019s previous offer to the pharmaceutical group under former Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt included up to \u00a370mn in grants to develop an existing AstraZeneca vaccine facility at Speke, as well as \u00a320mn in research and development support from the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nHunt, who announced the deal to great fanfare in March of last year, told the Financial Times that AstraZeneca\u2019s decision was a \u201cmassive own goal by the government\u201d.\n\n\u201cManufacturing high-end vaccines is a huge opportunity for us to move away from over-dependence on the R&D part of the value chain,\u201d he said. \u201cI intervened personally to get this deal over the line in 2023 and am mortified the government has dropped the ball on it.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury said: \u201cA change in the make-up of the investment originally proposed by AstraZeneca led to a reduced government grant offer being put forward.

The US index\u2019s tech share rises to 45 per cent if stocks such as Amazon and Alphabet \u2014 categorised by the French bank as consumer and communications companies respectively \u2014 are included.\n\nIn addition, Trump\u2019s softer stance on tariffs \u2014 the White House has said the US will go ahead with 25 per cent duties on goods from Mexico and Canada and 10 per cent on goods from China, although as yet it has failed to hit the euro area with levies \u2014 has come as a relief to investors.\n\n\u201cExpectations for Europe were on the floor,\u201d said Sharon Bell, a senior equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. \u201cThis has changed.\u201d\n\nAfter years of underperforming Wall Street, European shares are also trading near their widest valuation discount to the US since at least the late 1980s, according to data from SocGen. The UK market in particular has benefited from low valuations, say analysts.\n\n\u201cI have been quite surprised by the increased interest in UK equities, it is probably because the growth expectations are pretty high compared to the rest of Europe,\u201d Bell said.\n\n\u201cAnd obviously it is cheap. It could also be seen as a hedge against tech\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009for diversification.\u201d\n\nThe strong performance of European stocks comes even as the Eurozone struggles to recover from a sharp rise in energy and food prices triggered by Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while the US economy continues to grow strongly.\u00a0Data this week showed the Eurozone economy unexpectedly stagnated in the fourth quarter.\n\nHowever, the prospect of further interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank may cheer investors, analysts said. In the US, markets believe inflationary pressures will force the US central bank to keep rates higher for longer.\n\n\u201cIf the market starts to freak about inflation in the US that will also be more positive for European equities in comparison,\u201d said SocGen\u2019s Kaloyan.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ray Douglas", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5dce2ba6-9bac-4dc2-a611-3586b26e5d1f"}, {"title": "Ofsted to press ahead with \u2018Nando\u2019s-style\u2019 scorecard for schools", "description": "Proposed assessment of 8 core areas would replace regulator\u2019s controversial single-word judgments", "author": "Anna Gross", "published_date": "2025-01-31T16:05:29.362Z", "content": "Education regulator Ofsted is pressing ahead with plans for a colour-coded scorecard to assess school performance across eight core areas that critics have compared to a Nando\u2019s spice chart.\n\nSir Martyn Oliver, chief inspector of Ofsted, will launch a consultation on a new system for assessing schools in England in which single-word judgments would be replaced with one- or two-word judgments across eight main areas, according to an internal presentation seen by the Financial Times on Thursday.\n\nThe system would replace the old process where schools were given an overall judgment ranging from \u201coutstanding\u201d to \u201cinadequate\u201d, which teachers have long complained was overly simplistic, often unrepresentative and extremely difficult to appeal against.\n\nThe eight core assessment areas that schools will be judged against are achievement, leadership and governance, curriculum, developing teaching, personal development and wellbeing, attendance, behaviour and attitudes, and inclusion.\n\nThe assessment areas of \u201cpreparation for next steps\u201d and \u201copportunities to thrive\u201d have been dropped since a previous iteration of the scorecard was circulated to stakeholders in November.\n\nThe consultation is expected to be launched next week, according to a senior figure in the school sector.\n\nOfsted did not comment.\n\nThe proposals to colour-code the performance designations have faced strong pushback from senior figures in the teaching sector, with some comparing it to the spice-ranking system used by fast-food restaurant Nando\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still Nando\u2019s.

Sadly there is clear evidence to support his case \u2014 from attempts to monitor \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d to shocking attempts to suppress the views of gender critical academics such as Kathleen Stock and Jo Phoenix.\n\nGoodwin is angry about hostility he himself has encountered because of his support for the populist right and has made a journey from university academic (until last year he was professor of politics at the University of Kent) to political activist. But his anger gets in the way of analysing the convergence on the university system of a range of very different forces.\n\nFirst is the intellectual climate, itself shaped by universities. They are where critical theory began and flourished. It is a theory which appeals to academics because it says that words matter: language is a tool of oppression. So our language and the curriculum have to be decolonised in order truly to deliver diversity, equity and inclusion. It is an agenda far removed from classic concerns of the left such as what people earn and what access they have to public services. And there is another crucial difference. There were always left-wing academics \u2014 as well as some of a more conservative disposition. But the university as an institution was not engaged in their arguments and did not take a view. Now there are universities, especially but not only in America, where advocates of critical theory have recruited university administrators who use university-wide EDI programmes to advance their agenda and try to require academics to comply.\n\nSecondly there is the intense transgender debate, exacerbated in the UK by misinterpretation of the Equality Act. Too many universities, perhaps influenced by the LGBTQ+ rights charity Stonewall, interpreted the Act to mean any form of self-identified gender is a protected characteristic. The Reindorf review of problems at the University of Essex is a clear and authoritative account of serious mistreatment of academics as a result. Since it was published in 2021 no British university should repeat such behaviour.\n\nThe third trend is how students are changing. The psychologists Jean Twenge and Jonathan Haidt have persuasively argued that the rise in access to social media is leading to mental health issues for young people. This can lead to the introduction of trigger warnings and a belief that freedom of speech is less important than protecting people\u2019s feelings. However, higher education appears to provide some resilience to these pressures, lowering the risk of young people withdrawing from work because of mental illness.\n\nThere is a class divide too. Young white working-class men are even less likely to go to university than many ethnic minority groups. We should encourage more to go. The real luxury belief is advantaged graduates saying there is no point going to university when for many young people from disadvantaged backgrounds it is the most powerful tool of social mobility we\u2019ve got. For those who were previously on free school meals, average graduate earnings growth in their first decade is 75 per cent, while for non-graduates it is 26 per cent. But instead of promoting the value of higher education, social mobility advocates have put more weight, probably excessive, on the early years.\n\nThere has also been the shift in attitudes away from globalisation, represented by Trump and Brexit. David Goodhart, cited by Goodwin, makes universities the arch-culprits in his moral divide between citizens of Somewhere or Nowhere. This is particularly hard on universities as most of them have places in their names. They are definitely somewhere and a good thing too. They are very likely to stay rooted in their place even if the big employers move out or the local paper closes down. Towns and cities in the UK such as Chester, Coventry, Worcester or Bournemouth have been revitalised by the emergence of a strong local university. The government may be underestimating the shockwaves if a university closes.\n\nAdd to this mix empowering the student as consumer. The student is not just a consumer, though the university fee is a contract to deliver a service and that strengthens the student voice. Most local student unions don\u2019t want Marxist revolution but to get their academic work back promptly and seminars that are less crowded. But student satisfaction rankings have been given exaggerated weight and empowered students to threaten academics on very different issues.\n\nThere are university leaders who see that all these forces mean they have heavy new responsibilities which they cannot avoid. Universities should be the place where diverse young people learn how to disagree. The 2015 Chicago Statement of the principles of free speech in university is important and Goodwin wants \u201cto force universities, through government action, to sign up\u201d and then to practise what they preach.\n\nHis many anecdotes move between UK and US as if our two university systems are interchangeable. But there are important differences such as greater labour market protections in the UK (and even more in Europe). Protection from unfair dismissal matters if an academic is caught in a social media frenzy. This might explain the paradox that American and to some extent British universities have been far more susceptible to some of these forces than Continental Europe despite their intellectual origins in Continental postmodernist philosophy.\n\nGoodwin wants to use \u201cthe powers of the state to restore justice and balance\u201d. The loss of confidence in the ability of universities to protect freedom of speech justified the 2023 freedom of speech legislation with new powers for the university regulator, which I support. But this is tricky territory.\n\nThe problems began on the morning the previous Conservative government launched the initiative. On the Today programme the minister responsible was asked if this meant Holocaust denial would be protected, and she said yes. Holocaust denial is not itself a legal offence in the UK so her statement made sense for a proper free speech absolutist. Within hours, however, No 10 corrected her: it was not protected under the new legislation. We have never known what this free speech code is that does not permit some legal free speech. We do need stronger protections, but Goodwin doesn\u2019t really engage with the issue of whether there are to be any constraints at all.\n\nThere is a great American tradition of academics worrying that the modern university is rejecting the culture which nurtured it \u2014 William Buckley\u2019s God and Man at Yale, Allan Bloom\u2019s\u00a0The Closing of the American Mind, and now Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt\u2019s The Coddling of the American Mind. In Britain we have tended to express our anxieties instead through the campus novel, a genre of which we are masters. Malcolm Bradbury\u2019s The History Man skewers a certain sort of progressive academic with more skill and subtlety than Goodwin manages.

It was enough space to create a jewel-box garden studded with clipped yew and beech topiary, exquisite borders, an ornamental kitchen garden and swaths of meadows that were gently and patiently coaxed back from scrubland.\n\nBut the 15th-century house, which sits in a deep basin with pasture and woodland rising up around it, had originally been part of a much larger estate of 160 acres. In 2022 this \u201clost\u201d land \u2014 the largest single Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in Wales \u2014 became available to buy. \u201cIt always felt like we were connected to the landscape,\u201d says Maynard. \u201cBut bringing the land back in ownership with the house \u2014 all of a sudden, the house had a completely different feel and a different purpose. It was like a divorce that we reunited.\u201d\n\nThe land had been largely unmanaged, which meant an enormous variety of wild flowers had flourished \u2014 but so too had pernicious weeds. \u201cMost of the land was covered with brambles and bracken, some of it to chest height,\u201d explains Collinson, who first had to repeatedly flail the land to clear it, a process they had already carried out on the wild-flower meadows. \u201cThe pastures regenerated quickly, and the bank of wild flowers in those areas which we\u2019ve uncovered has been fantastic. We have huge quantities of orchids. They\u2019re just everywhere. You can\u2019t step on to the pastures without standing on an orchid.\u201d\n\nPart of the management plan set out by Natural Resources Wales \u2014 who oversee the SSSI designation \u2014 was that the land should be grazed properly, and that provided Collinson with the opportunity to realise a long-held dream. He\u2019s descended from a long line of farmers \u2014 his maternal ancestors had farmed a block of land on the Somerset Levels since the Domesday.\n\nThey acquired a small herd of White Park cattle in 2022. It\u2019s an ancient breed \u2014 its distinctive head, with long elegant horns, has been the logo of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust since its inception in 1973, when there were only around 65 breeding females of White Park left; there are around 750 today. It\u2019s widely considered to be the most ancient British breed, descended from the country\u2019s original wild white cattle and prized for its hardy nature. For the novice farmer, this was a key consideration, since the herd can happily live outside year round.\n\nBut the White Park is also valued for its excellent foraging abilities and gentle grazing, making it the perfect breed for coaxing back the land, clearing overgrown patches and opening it up in \u201ca completely natural way\u201d. Once the process of clearing patches begins, the cows then go in and forage to fully clear it, exposing the soil and, at the same time, exposing the seed bank, allowing native wild flowers to grow and kick-starting a regenerative cycle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see how the land is improving, to see how the land has become different during the period of our ownership. You can see quite clearly how our pasture is different,\u201d says Maynard. The grasses on their land are all native, in contrast with modern hybrid grasses used on many nearby farms. \u201cPastures owned by farmers who farm more intensively and fertilise look completely different. Ours feels medieval.\u201d\n\nAs well as a sea of orchids, including the common spotted orchid and southern marsh orchid, the land is now rich with wild flowers including cardamine, knapweed, cranesbills, yarrow, vetch, buttercups, sorrel and betony. Abundant birdlife has followed, including nightingales in summer.\n\nThe White Park herd roams between pasture and woodland, allowing it to self-medicate with herbs and wild flowers, and to eat bark from hazel and fruit trees. \u201cIn the old days, farmers used to cut green branches to feed the cattle and they would graze off all the lower leaves,\u201d says Maynard. \u201cThey might kill off the young bark of hazel, but there\u2019s this whole ecosystem that starts to happen.\u201d\n\nConservation grazing has grown substantially over the past 15 to 20 years says Christopher Price, chief executive of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. In the charity\u2019s latest watchlist rare breeds including Dartmoor sheep, New Forest ponies, saddleback pigs and native goat breeds are among those increasing in number. It\u2019s a welcome return. \u201cThe landscapes and habitats that we cherish were largely created by wild or semi-feral grazing animals,\u201d says Price.\n\nMaynard and Collinson currently have 13 cows. Caring for the herd has, says Collinson, been a daily adventure, everything from dealing with the grisly fallout from a broken horn (\u201cshocking in the extreme\u201d) to the awe of the first calves being born last spring. The cows take themselves off to find a hollow or dense copse where they give birth alone, before calling for the rest of the herd, who then form a protective cr\u00e8che for the new addition.\n\n\u201cEvery day I\u2019m learning something new,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey are quite docile, quite friendly, but terribly strong. You can rub their noses, and they\u2019ll eat out of your hand. And I know them well, but they\u2019re also wilful. They won\u2019t do what they don\u2019t want to do.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d like to slowly expand the herd to perhaps 15 or 20 in total. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be enough to make any kind of a living from, but the sense of wellbeing that comes from managing them is fantastic. Something that money can\u2019t buy.\u201d\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow @ft_houseandhome on Instagram\n\nThis article has been amended", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b2ec3355-d71e-44d0-ac16-c26119cbd11c"}, {"title": "New UK asylum bill to criminalise those who seek to prevent small boat rescues", "description": "Proposed government legislation would result in 100 more people being jailed each year, according to estimates", "author": "Anna Gross", "published_date": "2025-01-30T21:57:01.166Z", "content": "The UK government\u2019s border security bill will lead to about 100 more people being sent to prison each year, according to internal government estimates, while criminalising asylum seekers who seek to prevent rescue operations at sea.\n\nExperts have questioned whether the measures will lead to a reduction in overall arrivals of migrants by small boats.\n\nIn moves aimed at targeting smuggling gangs the new border security, asylum and immigration bill will give the government counterterrorism-style powers, such as seizing electronic equipment \u2014 including mobile phones \u2014 belonging to migrants when they cross the Channel into the UK.\n\nIt will create an offence of \u201cendangering life at sea\u201d, aimed at criminalising people who prevent offers of rescue while at sea \u2014 in order to ensure their boat reaches English shores.\n\nThe legislation will also make it illegal in this context to supply or handle small boats and related equipment, including engines and life jackets.

And Heathrow believes that they can as well,\u201d Reeves told the BBC.\n\n\u201cI believe [sustainable aviation fuels] are a game-changer in the way that we fly and the carbon emissions,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the government is only expecting 22 per cent of UK jet fuel to be supplied by SAF by 2040, according to a document dated December 2024.\n\nSAF is made from a diverse range of sources, including crops, used cooking oil, household waste or hydrogen and can emit about 70 per cent less carbon dioxide over its life cycle than traditional aviation fuel.\n\nIt is also much more expensive than traditional jet fuel and is currently only available in small quantities.\n\nThe government in January introduced a mandate that required fuel producers to supply a portion of SAF for flights departing the UK.\n\nThe mandate is for 2 per cent of fuel to be SAF this year and steadily rises to reach 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040.\n\nThe targets are in line with the aviation industry\u2019s road map to reach net zero by 2050, which is heavily reliant on SAF but includes other measures such as more efficient conventional jets and air traffic control management.\n\nBut Tim Johnson, the director of the Aviation Environment Federation, said that under current forecasts the aviation industry would need all the available SAF in the UK in 2035 just to meet the growth in flight numbers from a third runway at Heathrow.\n\n\u201cThis is not just this government having an over-optimistic take on SAF. It is consistent with every government in the world, because falling back on SAF allows them to continue to pursue growth,\u201d he said.\n\nAirlines are concerned that not enough SAF is being produced to hit the government\u2019s targets and some have suggested that the SAF mandates might need to be watered down.\n\nTo help build a homegrown SAF industry, airlines and airports have urged ministers to speed up the rollout of a financial support mechanism to encourage investors to put money into production.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be an alignment between the hugely welcome language around growth and boosting capacity at airports and incentivising the production of SAF,\u201d said Tim Alderslade, chief executive of lobby group Airlines UK.\n\nThe government has outlined plans for an industry-funded \u201crevenue certainty mechanism\u201d, which would guarantee a minimum price for the fuel, similar to schemes used to underwrite nuclear and offshore wind projects.\n\nBut it is not expected to be introduced until the end of next year.\n\nA Government spokesperson said:\u00a0\u201cWe are committed to delivering greener aviation to support our mission to kick-start economic growth and to make Britain a clean energy superpower.\n\n\u201cWe are already making great strides in the path to greener aviation, with new targets for sustainable aviation fuel starting this year. Yesterday we also announced \u00a363 million to boost UK production of sustainable fuels and set out measures to attract investment in in the UK sustainable aviation fuels market.\u201d\n\nNoaman Al Adhami, head of UK at fuel company Alfanar, said he cannot close the financing for a plant to produce more than 130,000 tonnes of SAF a year on Teesside without the guarantees from the government on a revenue certainty mechanism.\n\n\u201cWithout it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to close the project,\u201d he said.\n\nThe previous Tory government\u2019s plan to scale up SAF production called for five refineries to be under construction in the UK by the end of this year. None have been financed or built.\n\nGlobal SAF production volumes reached 1.3bn litres last year and accounted for 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production, according to Iata.\n\nGiven the challenges to scaling up SAF globally, Al Adhami said the UK was still ahead of many other countries, following its introduction of both the mandate and promise of a revenue support mechanism.\n\n\u201cAt least now from a risk perspective and the capital we have invested in the UK, there is more certainty,\u201d he said.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/78c3705d-d484-48ce-adfb-ffc827fc0646"}, {"title": "The contradictions at the heart of Rachel Reeves\u2019 growth plan ", "description": "Red lines hobble the chancellor\u2019s ambitions ", "author": "Gordon Smith", "published_date": "2025-01-30T17:00:43.354Z", "content": "Good afternoon on this, the eve of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the week that Rachel Reeves tried to put the rocket-boosters under Labour\u2019s economic growth strategy.\n\nHer upbeat speech in Oxford observed that getting Britain growing again was based on three pillars: political stability, regulatory reform and the combination of private and public investment.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much to disagree with, but because of the damage done by the Budget, it will take more than a sprightly speech for Reeves to dispel the underlying sense that this is a government still struggling to find the \u201cpolitical stability\u201d that is essential if they are to plausibly present themselves as agents of enduring change.\n\nReeves praised MakeUK, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, but reacting to the speech, chief executive Stephen Phipson warned that the government needed to resolve the contradiction between its growth-suppressing Budget and the paper ambitions set out by the chancellor.\n\nAnd therein lies the challenge.\n\nThe headline announcements that the government is backing a third runway at Heathrow, is getting behind the Oxford-Cambridge Arc again and will support the Manchester United regeneration project sends a clear signal to international investors that the UK is \u201copen for business\u201d.\n\nLess clear is whether a government led by a prime minister who is now less popular than Rishi Sunak at his nadir, has the political gumption to make the arguments necessary to deliver on ambitions that will pay relatively slow dividends.\n\nThis is not to be churlish, but to observe that Reeves\u2019 speech was delivered by a chancellor already on the back foot.

Reeves announced that the Environment Agency had finally cleared the long-delayed 5,400 home new town development at Waterbeach in Cambridge.\n\nBut according to research by Public First for the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster Board seen by the Financial Times, the region will need 15,000 homes a year on average to hit a high-growth trajectory \u2014 that\u2019s a threefold increase above 2023 levels in Greater Cambridge, Oxford and Milton Keynes.\n\nBrexit blues\n\nThe Budget is not the only place where election manifesto red lines have generated policy contradictions that are now hobbling Reeves in her growth mission.\n\nThe chancellor talked about the need for greater investment and trade, but the UK\u2019s \u201creset\u201d with Europe \u2014 which might have convinced investors that the UK was \u201cback\u201d \u2014 is severely limited by the decision to rule out rejoining a customs union or the EU single market.\n\nFive years after the TCA came into force, what is notable is how little anything has changed, despite the change of government.\n\nLabour pledged to \u201ctear down the barriers to trade\u201d with the EU while sticking to the same Tory red lines that created the Tories\u2019 \u201cfailed\u201d Brexit deal \u2014 Reeves\u2019 words, not mine \u2014 in the first place.\n\nThere was some positivity this week when (finally) the UK indicated it would look to relink the UK and EU carbon-pricing schemes and may consider joining the Pan-Euro Mediterranean customs agreement, but like Reeves\u2019 growth plans, for now these are paper commitments.\n\nEU officials now tell my colleagues in Brussels they expect a UK-EU summit \u201cin the first half\u201d of the year. That could be April or June, given the purdah period around local elections in May. The EU then needs to collectively agree a mandate. Don\u2019t expect talks until September or even October.\n\nAnd as the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank observed in its comprehensive survey of the past five years, Labour\u2019s plans for the EU reset, including a veterinary agreement and a deal for creative artists will deliver only marginal reductions in friction.\n\n\u201cWhilst benefiting certain sectors, these proposals would do little to address the overall economic impact of Brexit,\u201d it found.\n\nThe reality, as we reported this week, is that the EU \u201creset\u201d discussion is going nowhere fast, with even the legally non-binding Security Partnership now hung up on the familiar issues of fish and youth mobility, including restoring the rights of EU students to pay \u201chome\u201d fees when they come and study at UK universities.\n\nYou can blame the EU, and the French in particular, for being stuck playing old tunes about \u201cno cherry picking\u201d despite the strategic fears over Ukraine, but in truth the UK has done nothing to really shift the dial or build momentum. It has put no prizes on the table that would make EU member states behave any differently.\n\nAs with the October Budget and business, the government has managed to put itself into the \u201crecrimination phase\u201d with Brussels before it has even announced what it wants. That is a remarkable own-goal.\n\nIn a braver world, Starmer would have done a fast deal on fish (the last government already failed the fishermen) and embraced youth mobility as a cultural and economic opportunity, driving the negotiation with Brussels into a genuinely different place.\n\nIndeed, even very recently, as the Treasury and No 10 went into panic mode over growth, there was a moment to make arguments that going deeper with the EU should be part of the fix, as much as a third runway at Heathrow.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t happen, trapped as the government is by its framing of the problem and the potential opportunity. As one despairing Whitehall insider put it: \u201cIt is eerily reminiscent of 2017. We are now in serious danger of sinking back into a low-ambition doomloop.\u201d\n\nAre you enjoying The State of Britain newsletter?

But at The Dreamery, an otherworldly new wine bar and ice-cream parlour in leafy De Beauvoir Town, north London, they come together magically.\n\nThe pint-sized bar is the work of Alex Young and George de Vos, also the creators of Goodbye Horses, a convivial natural wine bar and restaurant on the same street that proved one of the underground hits of 2024. Around the same time, the pair also launched Day Trip, an artisan coffee shop in the same building. \u201cBoth George and I see creating hospitality venues as creating worlds in themselves,\u201d says Young, who used to work in tech. \u201cWe wanted to create a little village, an ecosystem that has a feeling of escapism.\u201d\n\nIce-cream and wine can be a tricky match from a purely technical point of view, as the sweetness of the former can make the latter taste flat. But whatever nuance is lost in the pairing is far outweighed by the spirit of fun it creates. \u201cOur approach to pairing is rather\u00a0anarchic,\u201d admits Young.\n\nThere\u2019s an improvisational feel to the whole enterprise \u2013 yet there are some significant names behind the scenes. Goodbye Horses was designed by the Swiss architect Leopold Banchini, who also has a permanent installation at the Centre Pompidou. The courtyard garden at Day Trip was created by garden designer Jihae Hwang, who has won several gold medals at the Chelsea Flower Show. Head of wine at Goodbye Horses is Nathalie Nelles, formerly of Noble Fine Liquor. De Vos himself was formerly GM of Brilliant Corners, a music venue and Japanese restaurant in Dalston.\n\nThe Dreamery is housed in an ex-grocer\u2019s shop. There is no sign outside \u2013 just a steamed-up three-paned window filled with animated silhouettes against a wash of colourful lights. The front door looks just like any other on the Victorian terraced street; but then you notice the stoop, which is painted, slightly spookily, with rune-like suns, moons and birds. Inside, it has the bones of an espresso bar \u2013 there are stainless-steel counters and mirrored walls. But the eye is drawn to the ceiling, where a dazzling backlit mural by artist Lucy Stein fills the space with colour. In the corner, a 1980s-style boombox plays whimsical Studio Ghibli scores.\n\nGoodbye Horses chef Jack Coggins makes all the ice-creams, which are chalked up in marker pen on the wall: on\u00a0my visit they included fig leaf, prune & oolong tea, gingerbread and pear and verjus sorbet (\u00a34 per scoop). There\u2019s no printed drinks list, which will irritate some, but\u00a0there\u2019s a small, regularly changing selection of easy-drinking, \u201cglou-glou\u201d wines: sparkling ros\u00e9 moscato; crunchy, red-berry beaujolais served cool; Alsatian riesling and one or two dessert wines (from \u00a37.50 a glass). The emphasis is on natural and low-intervention producers.\n\nI squeeze in at the bar and order a post-prandial scoop of coffee and butterscotch, and a glass of tawny passito moscato by Cascina Cerutti, which is caramelised and nutty; my friend has the fig-leaf ice-cream and a glass of lychee-scented riesling. Both wines have a degree of natural sweetness and so the end result is actually lovely.\n\nThe ice-cream comes in a stemmed steel gelato cup, like you might see in a cartoon. The wine glasses are printed with a crescent moon eating an ice-cream cone by Stein. Her folkloric illustrations are also a centrepiece of the more naturalistic Goodbye Horses across the street; they run the full length of the 10m bar and weave their way down the gauzy curtains. \u201cThere\u2019s a sort of childlike quality to Lucy\u2019s work,\u201d says Young, \u201clike you\u2019re seeing things with fresh eyes.\u201d\n\nOne influence for The Dreamery was the Paris bar Folderol, a fashionable glacerie-bar-\u00e0-vin in the 11th arrondissement. Young also tips\u00a0his hat to GlouGlou in Amsterdam, \u201cwhich has a big by-the-glass selection and is fun and easy-going in a way that wine bars often aren\u2019t\u201d. \u201cThe real guiding principle for all our bars is that we just want people to have a really nice time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more fun and joyous than eating ice-cream and drinking wine.\u201d\n\n@alicelascelles", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8caf3cb4-9962-4d1f-bd40-b216ead59113"}, {"title": "Crackdown on rogue university operators in England aims to cut loan fraud ", "description": "Department for Education pledges to improve the regulation of outsourced teaching   ", "author": "Maisie Grice", "published_date": "2025-01-30T15:36:45.772Z", "content": "Rogue operators that offer poor-quality courses on behalf of English universities in order to exploit the student loan system face a crackdown, under plans outlined by ministers on Thursday.\n\nThe Department for Education is proposing reforms to tighten controls on university franchising arrangements, after an investigation by the National Audit Office found fraudulent providers cost taxpayers \u00a32mn in 2022-23.\n\nUnder the plans, course operators with more than 300 students will need to register with the Office for Students \u201cto ensure their courses meet rigorous quality standards\u201d in order to receive funding, or face fines or possible suspension.\n\nMore than half of 341 franchised institutions are currently unregistered, the department said on Thursday.\n\nThe growing number of franchised providers in higher education has been partly driven by the financial crisis facing universities, which are looking to increase student numbers in a bid to offset high costs and a long-running freeze in domestic tuition fees.\n\nThe number of students enrolling on franchised courses more than doubled from 50,400 in 2018-19 to over 130,000 this academic year, according to departmental figures.\n\nThe NAO report found that 53 per cent of the \u00a34.1mn fraud detected by the Student Loans Company involved courses from franchised providers, despite accounting for only 6.5 per cent of total loan-funded students during the 2022-23 academic year.\n\nThe investigation uncovered a range of fraudulent activity, including loans being paid to students who had not met course admission criteria and were unable to provide an acceptance letter to the Student Loans Company, the government body that oversees course financing.\n\nIt also found that some providers were not checking whether students were attending their courses despite this being a condition of loan funding.\n\nSome franchised providers also used agents or paid cash bonuses to persuade students to sign up to courses, it found.\n\nEducation secretary Bridget Phillipson said: \u201cWe are committed to cracking down on rogue operators who misuse public money and damage the reputation of our world-class universities.\n\n\u201cThe credibility of our universities is at stake, but these proposals seek to protect students and safeguard taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d\n\nThe DfE\u2019s move to protect standards in the higher education sector comes during a period of financial uncertainty for universities.\n\nSeveral universities have reopened voluntary severance schemes, which could potentially lead to the loss of nearly 1,000 jobs, as they struggle to recruit lucrative international students, whose fees account for a growing share of the sector\u2019s income.\n\nData published on Thursday by the university admissions service Ucas revealed that a number of Russell Group universities were among the dozens of institutions hit by a double-digit decline in new international undergraduates during the 2024 application cycle.\n\nThe hardest hit Russell Group members were Newcastle University and the University of Sheffield, where admissions declined 26 per cent and 23 per cent respectively.\n\nNewcastle University announced its voluntary severance scheme last week in an attempt to save \u00a320mn, 5 per cent of its pay budget \u2014 or the equivalent of 300 full-time positions, according to a memo seen by the Financial Times.\n\nNewcastle University said it was \u201cnot immune\u201d to the funding challenges facing the higher education sector.\n\nUniversities outside of the Russell Group have also been affected. The University of East Anglia is looking to reduce its headcount by 163 full-time equivalent staff in order to save \u00a311mn, despite experiencing a 73 per cent increase in international undergraduate admissions for the current academic year.\n\nJo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said her organisation was willing to ballot for strike action in response to job cuts. \u201cOur members refuse to stand by and allow university managers to commit academic vandalism on such a grand scale\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Unfortunately, serious industrial unrest cannot be ruled out.\u201d\n\nCardiff University on Tuesday announced plans to cut 400 jobs, as well as the merging of departments and cuts to multiple courses including nursing.\n\nThe Department for Education said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been up front about the tough financial situation we\u2019ve inherited in relation to [higher education] providers in England, and we are determined to put our universities on a secure footing after years of financial challenges.\u201d\n\nThe government announced last year that tuition fees would start to rise in line with inflation from 2025-26.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f7ff474c-4934-47c2-bcde-2effb9ffe0d4"}, {"title": "Inflation and interest rates tracker: see how your country compares", "description": "Inflationary pressures are beginning to wane but not all central banks have taken action yet.

The Financial Times this week revealed plans by Sky News to shift resources away from its linear channel to premium paid content.\n\nMahon said Channel 4 was \u201cway ahead\u201d of rivals in its transition to digital, while the group would also diversify its revenue over the next five years by creating its own TV shows for the first time.\n\nThe UK changed the law last year to allow Channel 4 to make and own rights to its own productions for the first time in its 40-year history, rather than outsource production to the independent sector.\n\nThis could include taking equity stakes in TV production groups, Mahon said, but Channel 4 would not spend \u201cbillions buying companies\u201d.\n\nChannel 4 had 1.83bn views on social media platforms last year, the majority on TikTok. It has weekly \u201creach\u201d of about 35mn on social media, about eight times greater than on live television.", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/48f492df-428f-4501-a4db-04fec67cdb53"}, {"title": "Rachel Reeves draws battle lines with her bets to fix low growth  ", "description": "Oxford-Cambridge arc may help Labour outmanoeuvre Tories but new runway will provoke ire from its own voters", "author": "Georgina Quach", "published_date": "2025-01-30T09:30:10.907Z", "content": "Good morning. Rachel Reeves delivered her big speech on growth. It contained a number of measures: some good (the Oxford/Cambridge arc tops that list), some bad (the third runway at Heathrow) and some added to give the list of growth initiatives the appearance of a more even regional distribution (the regeneration of Old Trafford).\n\nSome thoughts on the political implications and challenges of them below.\n\nRachel Reeves announced (or in some cases re-announced) a swath of measures as part of her drive to fix the most alarming chart in British politics.\n\nThis is the biggest subplot to essentially everything else in British politics. Our economic model took a huge hit in the global financial crisis, it hasn\u2019t recovered since, and everything that successive governments have tried to fix the problem hasn\u2019t worked. (And some of the things they have done, Brexit most of all, have actively made the problem worse.)\n\nOur lack of growth makes everything harder, politically speaking. (To make matters worse, despite being an ageing island nation with sluggish economic growth, we completely failed to learn or even show much interest in Japan, a country that managed those challenges rather better than we did.) Because of that, we have seen both main parties electing leaders from their outer flanks \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn in 2017 and Liz Truss in 2022. It is also why no UK prime minister since David Cameron has been re-elected to a second term and why no prime minister since Tony Blair has served two full terms.\n\nThe best and most exciting measure that Rachel Reeves outlined was the government\u2019s revived backing for the Oxford-Cambridge arc, a strategic plan to build transport links and housing between the two science-rich hubs.\n\nThis was not strictly speaking \u201cnew\u201d as Peter Kyle had announced it at the start of the week. The arc has a lot of cross-party support, but it was shelved by Boris Johnson. While his electoral coalition had relatively few voters who would benefit most from the arc, it had an awful lot of people who would have objected to the required extra building.\n\nLabour\u2019s backing for the arc, and the accompanying approval for much-needed infrastructure improvements such as reservoirs, is another signal that the government essentially regards the very rural seats it won for the first time in 2024 as \u201cone-and-done\u201d victories. That approach has some real negative consequences (the cocktail of changes to inheritance tax and other reliefs for agriculture will, I think, have some unwanted consequences and Labour will end up U-turning on them sooner or later). But it also has some great upsides, of which backing the Oxford-Cambridge arc is right at the top.\n\nYou can see the dividing line that Reeves wants here, politically: the Conservatives will be pushed into opposing the development and disruption that investing in the arc involves because of their imperative to compete with the Liberal Democrats in those seats where voters might be resistant to building. And then Labour, Reeves hopes, will be able to say \u201cwell, what you would do differently?\u201d\n\nThe chancellor has also urged Heathrow to fast-track proposals to build a third runway: I am frankly unconvinced by this as, indeed, are much of the cabinet. (Do read this excellent piece on the legal and political hurdles that still remain to its construction here.) In the short term, it feels like a good way for the government to lose friends and alienate people among environmentally-inclined voters. It also sets up a fun game that interviewers will be able to play whenever speaking to anyone in the cabinet or front bench who voted against expansion in 2018, asking what, exactly, in their view has changed. (I really don\u2019t think some overly optimistic wishful thinking about \u201csustainable aviation fuels\u201d is going to cut it on this one.)\n\nMore importantly, given that the government is only going to be able to get away with antagonising its base on so many issues, in terms of its impact on growth and investment, watering down the government\u2019s plans on employment rights gets you far more in terms of business investment and happiness than the third runway.\n\nI saw The Brutalist last night. Personally, I would say: don\u2019t bother. Danny Leigh\u2019s review is exactly right, down to the most damning observation of all, that the film loses its brilliance with the arrival of \u201ca large, dark plot point that, in common with the whole movie, I\u2019ve liked less the more I\u2019ve thought about it\u201d.

However, some industry executives have raised questions over the start-up nature of XLCC, which has never built HVDC cable before.\n\nOne developer also said a key risk would be a slower-than-expected rollout of offshore wind farms in the UK, reducing potential orders.\n\nCraig Stevens, investment director at SNIB, said the bank had\u00a0taken comfort from\u00a0XLCC\u00a0working with strategic technical partners such as China\u2019s Orient Cable to produce and test the cable.\u00a0XLCC said it had hired experts in HVDC manufacturing and was using tried-and-tested technology.\n\nOne potential XLCC customer is a subsea electricity interconnector from Morocco to the UK envisioned by Xlinks, a company founded by Simon Morrish, who is also behind XLCC. But the project is awaiting UK government approval.\n\nXLCC this month received a \u00a320mn investment from SNIB, building on the UK\u2019s National\u00a0Wealth Fund\u2019s earlier initial investment of \u00a320mn, with the option for an extra \u00a367mn as development progresses.\n\nSNIB, which was founded in 2020 as a development bank, had been established to take on more risk and fund start-ups and growth companies in sectors needed to revitalise the Scottish economy, Fidao said.\n\nThe XLCC facility would support about 900 long-term jobs, including more than 200 apprenticeships, with a further 300 project management roles expected to be based in Scotland.\n\nExpanding Scottish ports, Fidao added, was a priority given the significant quaysides expansion needed to assemble the infrastructure for the rollout of more offshore wind farms.\n\nOne of SNIB\u2019s largest investments to date is a co-investment with the UK into US-owned Ardersier port on the Moray Firth, an inlet of the North Sea.\n\nScotland has a pipeline of 40 gigawatts of offshore wind projects, all of which will require subsea cables to transfer the power ashore.\n\n\u201cProjects are getting delayed, prices are very high,\u201d said Ian Douglas, XLCC\u2019s chief executive. \u201cCompanies are fighting very hard to secure supply \u2014 you are typically seeing seven-year waits for HVDC cable.\u201d\n\nEuropean cable manufacturers, such as Milan-listed Prysmian, Paris-listed Nexans and Copenhagen-listed NKT, already had full order books, he added.\n\nPrysmian said: \u201cWhilst we have large backlog visibility, to suggest that our order book is full is incorrect.\u201d The company added that it was \u201cworking closely with its customers to deliver on time current, and future projects, and is receiving, and bidding for future orders\u201d.\n\nThe first phase of the XLCC facility\u2019s construction envisions 1,300km a year capacity with the potential to rise to 2,600km a year. Global demand in 2030 was forecast at 10,000km a year, XLCC said.\n\nThe Scottish National party government also hopes to incentivise uptake for supply chain companies, such as XLCC, by encouraging renewables developers that source equipment from domestic sources.\n\nSeabed lease agreements for projects from the late 2020s include requirements for local supply chain involvement.\n\n\u201cThat will propel manufacturing \u2014 it is going to be extremely important to demonstrate local supply chain,\u201d said Gillian Martin, acting secretary for net zero and energy. \u201cCompanies will even now be looking at this place for their cables.\u201d", "tag": "world-uk?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8ce06f13-c09c-42b4-ba65-d29d4983d60d"}, {"title": "Car production at UK plants falls below 1mn vehicles ", "description": "European exports slide as carmakers wrestle with slowing sales of EVs in Germany and France", "author": "Kana Inagaki", "published_date": "2025-01-30T00:01:33.744Z", "content": "Falling exports and the winding down of production of older car models saw UK vehicle manufacturing fall by almost 12 per cent last year, in the worst annual drop since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nCar and van production at British plants fell back below 1mn vehicles, to 905,233 models, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders released on Thursday showed.\n\nThe decline came on the back of weaker exports to Europe as carmakers wrestled with slowing sales of electric vehicles in key markets such as Germany and France.\n\nNissan and Jaguar Land Rover \u2014 the UK\u2019s two largest carmakers \u2014 also halted production of several models such as the Leaf EV and the Jaguar XE as they prepared to launch a new range of EVs.\n\n\u201cAmid significant geopolitical and trade tensions, UK manufacturers are set on turning billions of pounds of investment into production reality,\u201d Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT said. \u201cGrowing pains are inevitable.\u201d\n\nThe production of EVs and plug-in hybrids last year fell by 20.4 per cent, but still accounted for just over a third of all vehicles produced.

He also used encrypted messaging apps to communicate with Chinese officials, the indictment said.\n\nThe justice department on Friday said Rogers had \u201cunder the guise of teaching \u2018classes\u2019,\u201d met his co-conspirators in Chinese hotel rooms where he gave them sensitive trade secret information that belonged to the Fed.\n\nIt added the economist had been paid about $450,000 as a part-time professor at Fudan University in China.\n\nRogers denies the allegations, his attorney said.\n\nThe indictment is the latest in a rising number of cases in which officials from across the US government \u2014 and particularly agencies such as the CIA and the military \u2014 have been charged with providing sensitive or secret information to the Chinese government.\n\nIn recent years, the justice department has also become more public about highlighting cases to underscore the threat from Chinese espionage. Washington has accused Chinese hackers of attacking US telecoms networks in a massive and widespread campaign that has allowed the perpetrators to access the conversations of American officials.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington said it was \u201cnot familiar\u201d with the specifics of the Rogers\u2019s case, but said China \u201cupholds the rule of law\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe oppose any smear and attack on China with so-called \u2018spy risks\u2019,\u201d the embassy added.\n\nThe Chinese government is one of the biggest global holders of US government bonds. Fed interest rate decisions and signals on future monetary policy movements can also influence US Treasuries and are among the most closely watched reports across global financial markets.\n\nUS Treasury figures show that, as of November, China officially held $768.6bn of the debt, making it the second-largest foreign holder after Japan.\n\nThe indictment alleges the sensitive information was shared from \u201cat least 2018\u201d with alleged Chinese co-conspirators \u201cwho worked for the intelligence and security apparatus of China and who posed as graduate students at a [Chinese] university\u201d.\n\nThe Fed declined to comment.\n\nRogers, who speaks limited Chinese, discussed teaching topics that would make the meetings seem \u201clegitimate in the eyes of the Fed\u201d, according to encrypted messages exchanged with his alleged co-conspirator that were cited in the indictment.\n\nRogers\u2019s travel was covered by his Chinese counterparts. \u201c[D]on\u2019t worry about the cost of the trip\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we don\u2019t waste money, but we can bear all the necessary cost, you can choose a comfortable and convenient way for the trip,\u201d an alleged co-conspirator said in a message included in the indictment.\n\nThe trade secrets at the heart of the case allegedly include the assessment of an European Central Bank announcement, briefing notes for a member of the Fed\u2019s board and a document titled \u201cPre-FOMC Briefing\u201d \u2014 all dated 2019.\n\nRogers in 2020 lied to the office of the Fed\u2019s inspector general when asked about his accessing and sharing of sensitive material, prosecutors said.\n\nLiza Tobin, a former National Security Council China director, said potential targets needed to be more vigilant about approaches from China.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s some career advice: if someone from a Chinese university offers you $450,000 for a part-time\u00a0job, run away,\u201d said Tobin, who is now a managing director at Garnaut Global, a geopolitical advisory firm. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting that kind of offer because of your brilliance and charm.\u201d", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1cf013ed-5e49-4925-acd4-3041eab6b028"}, {"title": "Trump\u2019s border crackdown traps migrants in Mexico", "description": "US border measures prompt rise in asylum applications in neighbouring country", "author": "Christine Murray", "published_date": "2025-01-31T05:00:44.968Z", "content": "Growing numbers of migrants who had been seeking to reach the US are instead making plans to stay in Mexico for long periods after US President Donald Trump launched a crackdown at the border.\n\nIn the border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the Jesuit Refugee Service, a non-profit offering legal and humanitarian assistance, has seen three times the number of people wanting its help to request asylum in Mexico this month as in all of 2024, said local branch director Alejandra Corona.\n\nMexican media showed long lines outside the offices of Mexico\u2019s asylum agency Comar in recent days, with more people trying to lodge applications to avoid detention by immigration authorities and secure a work permit.\n\n\u201cAsylum applications to Comar have increased in Tapachula and Mexico City in the last few days,\u201d said Giovanni Lepri, Mexico representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nIn his first week in office, Trump, who campaigned heavily on curbing migration, declared a national emergency at the southern border, sent 1,500 military personnel to help with enforcement, and cancelled his predecessor Joe Biden\u2019s legal pathways for entry.\n\nThe US has also launched highly publicised deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and begun regularly using military planes for deportation flights.\n\nOne factor sending migrants away from the border for the time being is Trump\u2019s scrapping of an app, CBP One, that had assigned 1,450 appointments a day to request asylum at regular ports of entry.\n\nAt the El Buen Pastor shelter in Ju\u00e1rez, occupancy grew from just 14 people to 60 after the cancellation of CBP One, said its director Pastor Juan Fierro.\n\nAmong those who lost their appointments was Luis, 30, a Venezuelan who spent his savings on the journey from his home country, which has been hit by an economic collapse under Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s repressive regime.\n\nLuis finally reached the US-Mexico border with his sister, girlfriend and other family members and secured an appointment to cross into the US and apply for asylum, but one day before his slot, Trump cancelled it.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing we could do, and we\u2019re stuck on this side, defeated,\u201d he said in Ju\u00e1rez.\n\nMany migrants are opting to stay in Mexico to try to get a job or request asylum. Mexico\u2019s capital is seen as a safer option than border areas, with more work opportunities and public transport.\n\n\u201cWe want to go to Mexico City to at least work, clear our minds as time passes,\u201d Luis said.\n\nFor the past year, cities along the US-Mexico border had been much quieter than previously, with shelters below capacity and irregular crossings down. That resulted from a crackdown by Mexican authorities, tighter US restrictions, and more legal pathways to cross through the app.\n\nBut for many migrants, returning home \u2014 whether to Venezuela, other countries in the region or parts of Mexico plagued by violence linked to drug cartels \u2014 is not an option. Many said they still hoped to reach the US eventually.\n\n\u201cGoing to the US is illogical, we can\u2019t get there\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but it\u2019s also dangerous here in Ju\u00e1rez,\u201d said Roxana, a 52-year-old from southern Mexico who said she had not yet decided where to go.\n\nGloria, a 54-year-old Guatemalan woman in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, said she believed Trump had not thought through the economic impact of his policies on industries such as agriculture, which rely on undocumented workers.\n\n\u201cGuatemala\u2019s men are men of corn, working men, the sun nor the rain stops them,\u201d she said. \u201cAre the Americans going to dare to go out to the fields to work?\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009The president should have thought of that.\u201d\n\nMexico\u2019s government has been creating shelters fit for 2,500 people each to take back deportees from the US.\u00a0Several organisations said the system was unusually efficient so far, but that there was no

per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting this weekend.\n\n\u201cCanada must threaten to impose a 100 per cent tariff on all Tesla vehicles and a 100 per cent tariff on US wine, beer and spirits if unfair tariffs are imposed on Canadians,\u201d Freeland said on Friday.\n\nThe comments from one of Canada\u2019s most important politicians mark a sharp escalation in the trade dispute with Washington, which blew into the open after Trump said he would impose tariffs on the US\u2019s two biggest trading partners from February 1.\n\nThe White House on Friday reiterated its plan to impose the tariffs starting on Saturday.\n\nTrudeau also on Friday said Canada was ready to retaliate against the US: \u201cWe\u2019re ready with a response \u2014 a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\u201d he said, as he warned Canadians, \u201cour nation could be facing difficult times in the coming days and weeks\u201d.\n\nFreeland, who was part of the Canadian team that negotiated the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal signed by Trump during his first presidency, said releasing\u00a0a targeted list of potential retaliatory tariffs on $200bn worth of American imports would show where \u201cwe can hit Trump where it hurts\u201d.\n\n\u201cBy targeting products from Republican states that voted for Trump and products made by his billionaire buddies, Canada can exert unavoidable political pressure on the White House,\u201d she said.\n\nCanada previously imposed 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, in a move that followed similar levies on Chinese EVs announced by Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nFreeland\u2019s comments also came as M\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, held last-gasp talks in Washington to try to avert Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nJoly used a Financial Times interview on Friday to warn the US that any disruption to energy flows between Canada and its southern neighbours triggered by a trade war would leave American oil refiners dependent on alternative heat oil supplies from Venezuela.\n\nJoly also vowed Canada would never become a \u201ccolony\u201d, in a reference to Trump\u2019s claims that Canadians would like to join the US and his repeated goading of Trudeau, who he has called a \u201cgovernor\u201d of the \u201c51st state\u201d.\n\nCanada and Mexico have drawn up lists of \u201ctit for tat\u201d tariffs to issue against the US as soon as Trump imposes tariffs.\n\nMexico\u2019s left-wing president Claudia Sheinbaum said earlier this week that she did not think the 25 per cent tariffs would happen on Saturday, but on Friday said the government was planning for different scenarios.\n\n\u201cWe have a plan A, plan B and a plan C, whatever the United States government decides,\u201d she said on Friday morning.\n\nDan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said a tariff war would be a huge concern for small Canadian businesses as more than half their members import goods from the US.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s new best friend is Elon and targeting these type of people close to the president might add pressure but, overall we are urging caution with retaliatory measures,\u201d he said.\n\nTiff Macklem, governor of the Bank of Canada, on Wednesday said US tariffs would likely put Canada in a recession and also raise consumer prices in the US.\n\nThe Canadian dollar and Mexican peso rose against the US dollar on Friday after reports that Trump may push back the implementation of any new tariffs to March.\n\nAdditional reporting by

"content": "Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang met US President Donald Trump for the first time at the White House on Friday, as Washington and Silicon Valley weigh their responses to Chinese start-up DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthrough.The meeting between Trump and Huang was to include discussion of AI policy, according to a person familiar with the discussion. On his first day in office, Trump revoked a Biden administration executive order focused on AI safety and has generally been seen by tech executives as accelerating America\u2019s advances in the fast-moving technology.Two people familiar with the meeting said it had been planned before DeepSeek stunned Silicon Valley with AI advances apparently achieved using far less computing power than US tech groups. The news wiped almost $600bn from the value of Nvidia, one of the biggest winners from spending on AI chips, on Monday. Neither the White House nor Nvidia disclosed details of the conversation afterwards, or whether specific agreements were made as a result of it. Speaking with reporters on Friday afternoon in the Oval Office, Trump called Huang a \u201cgreat gentleman\u201d and added the US would eventually put tariffs on computer chips. It was not clear if the chip tariffs were part of the discussion with Huang. Tariffs on chips and \u201cthings associated with chips\u201d were part of a sweeping plan announced by Trump on Friday for new restrictions on imports from the US\u2019s biggest trading partners.\u201cWe appreciated the opportunity to meet with President Trump and discuss semiconductors and AI policy,\u201d Nvidia said. \u201cJensen and the president discussed the importance of strengthening US technology and AI leadership.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s AI leap has sparked calls in Washington for the US government to tighten export controls further on AI-related technology to make it even harder for China to make advancements in the sector.\n\nOn Saturday, Singapore\u2019s government hit back at suggestions that DeepSeek could have acquired its AI chips from Nvidia\u2019s subsidiary in the city state, as a way of avoiding US export controls.\n\nUS authorities were reported to be investigating how DeepSeek accumulated the chips and were focusing on Singapore, which accounts for more than a fifth of Nvidia\u2019s revenues.\n\n\u201cWe expect US companies, like Nvidia, to comply with US export controls and our domestic legislation,\u201d Singapore\u2019s government said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur customs and law enforcement agencies will continue to work closely with their US counterparts.\u201d\n\nLast Monday, the same day DeepSeek released its latest model, Trump issued an executive order telling the state department and commerce department to review the US export control system \u201cin light of developments involving strategic adversaries\u201d.\n\nNvidia has long protested the expansion of US export controls that limit sales to China of its most powerful processors for AI. The Silicon Valley-based chipmaker has argued that constraining Chinese companies\u2019 access to American technology would only fuel China\u2019s innovation and development of its own local semiconductor industry.\n\nDeepSeek said its breakthrough AI model was created using a fraction of the computing resources of US rivals such as OpenAI or Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, which are assembling clusters of hundreds of thousands of chips. The final training run for its V3 model cost $5.6mn using just over 2,000 Nvidia chips, DeepSeek said in a research paper, although that figure excluded prior development costs.\n\nAnalysts at SemiAnalysis, a chip consultancy, have estimated that DeepSeek and its sister company, hedge fund High-Flyer, have access to about 60,000 Nvidia graphics processing units and have spent more than $500mn on chips to date.\n\nNvidia, which was the most valuable US company until Monday\u2019s stock market panic, was co-founded by Huang more than 30 years ago, turning the Taiwan-born businessman into one of America\u2019s richest people. He is now one of Silicon Valley\u2019s longest-serving CEOs.\n\nIn a letter to Mike Waltz, the new US national security adviser, the Republican chair and top Democrat on the House China committee, said the DeepSeek advance underscored the need for \u201cfrequently updating export controls\u201d. Josh Hawley, a Republican senator, has also introduced legislation that would prohibit the export to China of AI technology.\n\nAs the Biden administration tightened controls on what US chipmakers could sell in China since October 2022, Nvidia has continued to sell adapted versions of its AI chips there, alongside GPUs for the country\u2019s burgeoning PC gaming market. Customers with billing addresses in China, including Hong Kong, accounted for $11.6bn in revenues in the nine months ending in October, according to Nvidia\u2019s latest results.", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/65e9c766-9ff7-4ff8-bff1-2c1c05c9d802"}, {"title": "Venezuela releases US prisoners and agrees to take deportees", "description": "Agreement struck in meeting between Trump\u2019s envoy and country\u2019s authoritarian leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ", "author": "Joe Daniels", "published_date": "2025-02-01T18:03:27.905Z", "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s crisis negotiator returned from Venezuela with six freed American prisoners after securing a commitment from the South American country\u2019s authoritarian leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to accept deported migrants.\n\nRichard Grenell, the US president\u2019s envoy for special missions, travelled to Venezuela on Friday to press Maduro to accept thousands of Venezuelan deportees, according to US officials, and to secure the release of US nationals taken prisoner by Caracas.\n\nDonald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Saturday: \u201cIt is so good to have the Venezuela Hostages back home and, very important to note, that Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their Country, all Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the U.S\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u201d\n\nThe Venezuelan government said in a statement that the talks were \u201crespectful\u201d and touched on migration, sanctions and detained US citizens, and that a \u201cfresh start\u201d was needed in relations between Washington and Caracas. It did not mention the release of the prisoners.\n\nGrenell\u2019s visit came just before secretary of state Marco Rubio embarked on his own trip to Latin America in a bid to demonstrate renewed US interest in the western hemisphere.\n\nGrenell, a close confidant of Trump, made the trip after Maduro signalled his willingness to talk with the US president\u2019s team, people familiar with the situation said. Russia, one of Maduro\u2019s backers, sent a government plane to Caracas that landed 15 minutes before Grenell\u2019s arrival on Friday.\n\nMaduro, a close ally of Russia and Iran, has been shunned by the west and much of Latin America after claiming victory in a presidential election last July whose result was widely regarded as fraudulent. The administration of former US President Joe Biden and the European parliament recognised the main opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as president-elect.\n\nResponding to a reporter on Friday while signing an executive order at the White House, Trump said Grenell\u2019s visit did not grant legitimacy to Maduro\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cWe want to do something with Venezuela. I\u2019ve been a very big opponent of Venezuela and Maduro,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve treated us not so good, but they\u2019ve treated, more importantly, the Venezuelan people, very badly.\u201d\n\nGrenell said in a post on X on January 20 that \u201cdiplomacy is back\u201d, saying he had held \u201cmultiple conversations with Venezuelan officials\u201d and that \u201ctalking is a tactic\u201d. He held a private meeting with Maduro\u2019s top political operator Jorge Rodr\u00edguez in Mexico in 2020 in the final days of the first Trump administration.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez this week urged Trump not to cut a deal with Maduro, and the Venezuelan opposition has been alarmed by meetings it held with him before Grenell travelled to Caracas.\n\n\u201cGrenell\u2019s nonchalance and lack of concern for democracy and human rights has left everyone very concerned,\u201d said an opposition figure who did not want to be named. The opposition fears that business interests will lobby Trump to cut a deal giving the US more access to Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves, the world\u2019s biggest.\n\nTrump\u2019s own position on Venezuela is unclear. He has said little about the country during the election campaign or since taking office, beyond accusing Maduro of ruining the country and saying on January 20 that \u201cwe don\u2019t have to buy their oil\u201d \u2014 remarks interpreted by some as a negotiating tactic to put pressure on Maduro. Ahead of Maduro\u2019s swearing-in, Trump referred to Gonz\u00e1lez as \u201cpresident-elect\u201d and the opposition as \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d.\n\nA former official who worked in Trump\u2019s first administration said the US president was mainly concerned about migration. \u201cHe\u2019s just revoked temporary protected status for 600,000 Venezuelan [migrants] in the US and there are easily twice that number there illegally,\u201d the former official said. \u201cTrump has got to get rid of them all from the US.\u201d\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d sanctions on Maduro\u2019s government and recognised then-opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president. But the strategy failed to dislodge Maduro, who remained in power with the help of Russia, China and Iran, while Guaid\u00f3 eventually fled to Florida.\n\n\u201cTrump regards the opposition as losers,\u201d the former official said. \u201cHe gave them a lot and they failed.

The following day, the markets veteran was looking at figures showing a surge in overnight trading on online broker Robinhood as investor darling Nvidia slumped amid worries about Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek.\n\nNvidia\u2019s travails produced the second-biggest late-night trading session for Robinhood, best known for popularising smartphone-based trading. It has offered overnight dealing for the past 18 months and Monday ranked for volume behind only the night of the US presidential election in November.\n\n\u201cOur users don\u2019t trade overnight once and go away,\u201d says Quirk, Robinhood\u2019s chief brokerage officer. \u201cThey look for an opportunity to do so again.\u201d\n\nRobinhood\u2019s activity boom in the small hours is only the latest example of the growing interest in overnight trading \u2014 a trend fuelled by the availability of sophisticated trading apps on phones, and an increasingly knowledgeable base of small retail investors as comfortable trading Amazon from their sofas as they are shopping on it.\n\nMany of these night owls developed a taste for trading during pandemic lockdowns, and a return to the office has pushed their investing habits outside of business hours. The overnight session \u2014 8pm to 4am in New York \u2014 often sees them trading with Asia\u2019s famously active household investors, who relish the chance to trade big US names in their daytime.\n\nAlthough retail trading is big business in the US, where more than half of all households hold stocks directly, developments in mom-and-pop trading habits would normally mean little to the vastly bigger professional world of asset managers and Wall Street brokers.\n\nBut that is changing because of the growing interest in overnight trading from more established quarters. The New York Stock Exchange, the largest in the world, is one of a number of groups which are now looking to offer much longer trading windows.\n\nThis is pushing investment professionals to engage in surprisingly complex debates around the simplest-seeming questions.\n\nWhen, for example, does a trading day begin and end if it runs around the clock? What would be the closing price of a stock \u2014 typically the reference point for trillions of dollars in funds \u2014\u00a0if the day were seamless?\n\nThose are just a couple of the big questions about trading through the wee hours. Other worries include how portfolio managers deal with the risks of big moves in their holdings while they\u2019re asleep, and the cost and difficulty of maintaining complex systems with little or no downtime.\n\n\u201cTalk 24-hour and the joke is, \u2018I don\u2019t know when our operations guy is going to sleep.\u2019 That is an actual issue,\u201d says Tyler Gellasch, chief executive of investor advocate Healthy Markets Association. \u201cBut I feel like that\u2019s going to be the least of your worries when you wake up to a margin call on a big position.\u201d\n\nBy some measures, stocks are already late to the overnight party.\n\nThe dollar trades 24 hours a day on various platforms around the world and dealing in S&P 500 index futures, which signal the likely market direction ahead of the New York opening, is brisk from the Tokyo morning onwards. Cryptocurrency investors, meanwhile, have never known anything but a 24-7 digital world.\n\nFrom the earliest days of informal trading in lower Manhattan coffee houses, US stock markets have largely stuck to some form of a traditional business day, though precise hours have varied.\n\nEven the rising power of west coast investors and companies has not altered the official New York 4pm close of business. The last major changes to the US day were made some two decades ago, when exchanges began offering pre- and after-market sessions that now run from 4am Eastern to the open, and from the close to 8pm Eastern, respectively.\n\nTraders in Los Angeles and San Francisco, three hours behind New York, suck up 5am starts for the joy of beating the traffic as they head home soon after 1pm on days when there is little to generate activity after 4pm in New York.\n\nDaytime trading for stocks is also practical because it involves so many parties: a million-plus people are employed directly in the US securities industry, and there are the executives of the companies whose shares are being traded and the regulators who oversee it all.\n\nAdding to the complexity is the sheer scale of the $50tn market. Some 12bn shares are traded daily through millions of transactions. The counterparties include giant pension funds, high-speed traders dealing in milliseconds and individual investors trading a handful of shares. Every transaction must be agreed, with money and shares changing hands the next day. On top of all this is a web of intricate rules designed to ensure fair dealing.\n\nBetween 8pm and 4am in New York, overnight trading, including on Robinhood, is now mostly conducted through Blue Ocean, a so-called alternative trading system that launched in 2021 specifically to offer overnight access. Members of these alternative systems \u2014 also known as \u201cdark pools\u201d \u2014 trade among themselves at prices that are not made public.\n\nWhile Blue Ocean\u2019s volumes, about 40mn shares a night, are a tiny fraction of what the likes of the NYSE do on any regular day, it has steadily built a market linking American night owls with Asian day traders. Now two exchanges are eyeing its turf.\n\nIn November, the Securities and Exchange Commission tentatively approved 24 Exchange, or 24X, a Bermuda-based group backed by hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 Ventures fund with plans to trade nearly all day long. Until recently, its main business had been currency trading. Once some key regulatory infrastructure is in place, it plans to open 23 hours a day with an hour for brokers to update their systems. Its approval makes it the first US exchange with an avowed goal of dealing overnight, although under industry pushback it shrank original plans that included weekend trading.\n\nNYSE too, may soon join the sleepless fray. The SEC is yet to weigh in on its separate plan, put forward by the exchange a month earlier, that would see it extend its trading day from the current 4am-8pm to a much lengthier 1.30am-11.30pm.\n\nThe involvement of exchanges matters for the rest of the market because they are more tightly supervised than dark pools and are responsible for continuously publishing their best bid (buy) and offer (sell) prices through their trading day. These flow through a service known colloquially as the \u201ctape\u201d, against which any investor can compare the price they got from their broker, who has an obligation to execute trades at the best price.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing from multiple types of market participants for about two years now that they think there is demand and opportunity to extend hours further,\u201d says Kevin Tyrrell, head of markets at NYSE.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also had global investors looking to the US more and more \u2014 for trading and investing and also large companies transferring their listings from other regions into the US. So it seems very natural for us to be having these conversations.\u201d\n\nBig industry reservations remain, however, from managing risk to having to operate all night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a solo game. Traders are always asking an analyst or a fund manager, \u2018Hey, does this new price point mean something?\u2019\u201d says one senior dealer at a large global investor. \u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest fear for folks, is that they end up on call 24 hours.\u201d\n\nIn June 2024, Justin Schack, a partner at Wall Street broker Rosenblatt Securities, appeared before a House committee looking into the US market set-up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that no one with a blank slate would design such a complex system to achieve such a simple task,\u201d Schack, who heads Rosenblatt\u2019s market structure team, told the politicians when describing the current system.\n\nOther Wall Street brokers agree. Ask them about the issues that 24-hour advocates must address and they list thorny ones: clearing or guaranteeing trades, building out technology and staffing, running the \u201ctape\u201d to cover longer hours and ensuring all their systems can cope.\n\nTraders have their concerns too, from how much stocks can move to whether regulators might factor overnight prices into how they apply daytime rules.\n\n\u201cWhat are the rules for overnight trading? If you did have a big price dislocation, where does the stock stop? Without clarity around specific items, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get institutional buy-in,\u201d says Mehmet Kinak, global head of equity trading at T Rowe Price, in a reference to the so-called circuit breakers operating in daylight hours, which temporarily halt a stock that moves particularly sharply.\n\nKinak adds that thin liquidity during extended hours makes it an unattractive time for big players to trade US stocks. \u201cWhat if a stock is indicated up 3 per cent and we happen to be a seller? By the time we are done executing an order for 200,000 shares, I\u2019m not going to get a price anywhere near up 3 per cent, there\u2019s just no depth or broad market participation.\u201d\n\nTo guard against wild swings that can catch investors out, overnight trades currently operate under a limit order system, meaning investors cannot simply send buy or sell instructions, but must set the price at which they will trade. If no one takes that price, the order expires unfilled in the morning.\n\nThe global head of trading for a west coast asset manager agrees with Kinak that overnight offers limited trading opportunities for big investors, but cautions that not trading might not remove the dangers.\n\n\u201cThe real questions, then, are about what we would have to consider in those hours for our oversight and technology,\u201d he says. \u201cCould a regulator come in and ask me about best execution, and point to prices overnight that I\u2019m not capturing as part of my process? That could create an obligation to staff markets 24 hours. That\u2019s a big burden to put on the entire industry.\u201d\n\nWhen the day starts and ends matters to investors everywhere too. Few in the industry want to change the official 4pm close \u2014 by far the busiest trading point in the current day because it is used to set the daily reference prices for traded securities, from which the $30tn-plus held in mutual and exchange traded funds take their value.\n\nAfter the close, an entire system of clearing and settlement also kicks in, ensuring that sellers receive their payment and buyers have their new holdings re-registered under their name.\n\nAdditionally, it is when systems are adjusted for changes to shares, such as a company altering the number of shares trading or announcing a dividend payment date. These adjustments move share prices and brokers bear the cost if they miss one: in 2023 Robinhood took a $57mn hit when its systems failed to register a company that shrunk its share count.\n\n24X plans a one-hour downtime at 7pm, while NYSE is suggesting two hours, not starting until 11.30pm. Those schedules raise some eyebrows.\n\n\u201cHow are brokers going to test their systems? In the wee hours? We\u2019d potentially be making thousands of market participants adjust to being able to work in the middle of the night and also work very quickly,\u201d says Healthy Markets\u2019 Gellasch.\n\nMost of the questions industry insiders are asking do not yet have definitive answers.\n\nThey can seem outsized too, given that more than 80 per cent of trading today, despite the pre- and post-market sessions, is still done within the regular New York market hours of 9.30am to 4pm \u2014\u00a0and no one expects an imminent, sustained boom in back-of-the-clock dealing.\n\nBut the discussions keep growing. The merits, or otherwise, of 24-hour trading often produce the liveliest debates at industry conferences around the US. They veer between a sense of inevitability and questioning the need for an overnight session at all. Privately, many traders are worried about the knock-on effect on their personal lives if trading hours get longer.\n\nThose already trading overnight are busy building ties with Asian brokers. Blue Ocean is opening a second Asia office in South Korea less than a year after its first in Tokyo. And on a trip this month to the region, 24X executives said they were overwhelmed with meeting requests.\n\n\u201cAsian retail investors have a very aggressive investing style and they want to trade Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla in their daytime and we\u2019re going to be well positioned to capture that,\u201d says Dmitri Galinov, chief executive of 24X. \u201cAs volumes rise, institutions will come in.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, more big US names are being drawn to trading out of hours. In November, Charles Schwab, the largest US broker, boasting $10tn in client assets, began offering overnight trading in more than 500 stocks and ETFs to its most active trader clients, up from 24 ETFs previously.\n\n\u201cOvernight trading has developed to the point we felt we could expand our offer,\u201d says James Kostulias, head of trading services at Charles Schwab. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new discussion by any means but it is now a reality.\u201d", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f711e768-5655-4c98-93bc-c83a8eab6c20"}, {"title": "Former national security adviser Jake Sullivan: \u2018The core engines of American power are humming\u2019", "description": "The Biden administration official on leaving Trump with a \u2018strong hand\u2019, export controls on AI chips \u2014 and why war with China is not inevitable \u00a0", "author": "Demetri Sevastopulo", "published_date": "2025-01-31T12:30:44.951Z", "content": "When Jake Sullivan enters the private room at Rasika West End, I joke with the former US national security adviser that I would have dressed down had I known he would be casual. \u201cSmart casual,\u201d he corrects me with a smile.\n\nSullivan has picked a modern Indian restaurant just blocks from where he has lived in Washington for the past four years with his wife Maggie Goodlander, the newly elected congresswoman from New Hampshire. \u201cThis was kind of a date place,\u201d he says, making me feel slightly like an imposter.\n\nJudging by the lack of commotion, you would not realise my guest had just spent four years at the heart of the White House, dealing with a Chinese spy balloon, nuclear threats from Russian president Vladimir Putin and conflicts across the Middle East. The 48-year-old was also the lead architect of what he described as a \u201cnew Washington consensus\u201d that fused economic and national security policies, driven by his view that America needed a \u201cforeign policy for the middle class\u201d.\n\nBefore we pivot to more serious issues, I have a sensitive question. Who is more Irish, Jake Sullivan or Joe Biden?\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going on number of times asserting Irishness in life, Joe Biden beats me,\u201d he says playfully, before noting that Biden, who generally only touts his Irish background, also has French and English roots. \u201cI am mostly, if not entirely, Irish,\u201d he continues, before delivering the killer blow: \u201c[The name] Biden, I think, is English.\u201d\n\nOur waitress is hovering. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna get the chicken tikka masala,\u201d he says. I order tandoori duck makani.\n\nThe wallpaper in the room depicts monkeys smoking cigars and drinking vodka, which makes his pitch for sparkling water disappointing. I twist his arm \u2014 with minimal effort. \u201cDay drinking,\u201d he laughs, and orders an Italian Valpolicella Ripasso.\n\nI want to ask about November 5, when Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump but Sullivan\u2019s wife was elected to Congress. How did he feel about losing the White House? \u201cHonestly, that night, it didn\u2019t fully sink in. I was so excited for Maggie,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a wonderful night, and then a harder morning.\u201d\n\nMonths earlier, there was another difficult moment when Biden had a catastrophic debate against Trump. Was Sullivan, a former university champion debater, surprised, or had there been signs that Biden was slipping? \u201cI had not seen that coming, flat out had not seen it,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought it was going to be a seismic event in the campaign.\u201d\n\nCritics argue that Biden\u2019s closest aides must have realised that he was slowing mentally. But Sullivan insists that he was taken by complete surprise. \u201cIt was not at all consistent with my experience.\u201d\n\nAs our wine arrives, I ask if he has started to think about why the Democrats lost the White House. \u201cI\u2019ve started to, but not nearly as much as I did in 2016. On November 9 2016, I was unemployed on my couch and could just sit and think about it indefinitely,\u201d he says.\n\nHe thinks the outcome of the 2016 election was \u201cdeeply structural\u201d and marked a \u201cdelayed reckoning of the 2008 financial crisis and a deep wellspring of anger among the American people that the system had failed them\u201d.\u00a0\u201c[2024] may just be one of those elections where you have a Democrat running against a Republican at a time of high prices and anti-incumbent global sentiment and the Republican narrowly beat the Democrat and it\u2019s not really about something existential,\u201d he says. \u201cOr maybe it will bear out that it\u2019s something more existential.\u201d\n\nSwitching to his time in the White House, I ask what he regards as his biggest accomplishment. He says he is proud to have helped create a situation where the \u201ccore engines of American power are humming\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur alliances are stronger than they\u2019ve been in a very long time. Our competitors and adversaries are weaker too in ways that have defied expectations, certainly with China. And we\u2019ve produced that very strong American hand without getting entangled in war overseas,\u201d he argues.\n\nHe continues by saying that the domestic investment in chips and export controls on AI-related chips, coupled with efforts to boost the defence industrial base and diversify supply chains, marked a new approach to policy. But he stresses that it is a \u201cgenerational project\u201d that he hopes the Trump administration will adopt and build on.\n\nChina policy, he adds, was another achievement. \u201cAmerica is in a demonstrably better position in the long-term competition with China than we were, and yet we did it while stabilising the relationship and finding areas to work together.\u201d\n\nHe says the US and China are in a \u201cdecisive decade\u201d that will determine which comes out ahead in key areas such as artificial intelligence and the transition to a clean energy economy. \u201cFour out of those 10 years in the decisive decade\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[have] turned in America\u2019s favour in a really significant way,\u201d says Sullivan, adding that the export controls the US imposed on high-end chips and manufacturing equipment have had a \u201cdemonstrable impact\u201d.\n\nDays after our lunch, a Chinese company called DeepSeek stunned Silicon Valley by unveiling an AI model that appears to rival US models. After the news broke, I emailed Sullivan to get his reaction. He says it shows that the US needs to \u201cstay on our game\u201d but he is \u201cstill confident in the American lead\u201d in AI. He stresses that it \u201conly reinforces\u201d his view on the importance of export controls.\n\nAnother critical area in the decisive decade is US deterrence in the face of what Sullivan describes as the \u201clargest peacetime military build-up in human history\u201d being undertaken by China. The US boosted deterrence by bolstering its alliances and urging allies to work more closely with each other, Sullivan says. He adds that Aukus \u2014 the US-UK-Australia agreement to enable Canberra to procure nuclear-powered submarines \u2014 was a \u201chuge deal\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strategic marriage between the United States and Australia for half a century,\u201d he says.\n\nAs our dishes arrive, Sullivan says his biggest regret is how the US handled its withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, which led to the deaths of 13 members of the American military. He says the administration had decided that pulling out too rapidly could destroy morale in Kabul and lead to the collapse of the Afghan government \u2014 but it ended up falling anyway.\n\n\u201cA lesson learned from that is, if there are risks associated with an evacuation, just move out early, even if it comes with some friction with the host government,\u201d says Sullivan.\n\nOver four years, he dealt with multiple crises involving China, including its 2021 hypersonic missile test, its huge military exercises in response to then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s trip to Taiwan in 2022, and the Chinese spy balloon that flew over the US in 2023. Which stands out in his mind?\n\nHe cites the spy balloon saga, which followed the \u201cextreme tensions\u201d sparked by Pelosi\u2019s Taiwan visit. \u201cIt felt like we were in a very deep hole, but something more than that. It felt like, in living colour, the risk of a downward spiral in the US-China relationship was not merely abstract. This could go bad.\u201d\n\nI am still puzzled as to whether China intentionally flew the balloon over the US, or if it was blown off course by weather. He says it is hard to say without veering into classified areas, but drops a hint. \u201cYou can find Biden comments publicly\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009where his personal opinion was that this was not intentional,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll say.\u201d\n\nA more recent espionage case is a months-long Chinese hacking attack against US telecoms networks called \u201cSalt Typhoon\u201d. \u201cWhat makes Salt Typhoon unique is the sheer scale of access,\u201d he says about the ongoing attack. \u201cThey weren\u2019t just going into a senior government official\u2019s phone. They were going into the major American telecommunications companies, Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, and picking any phone they wanted to listen to.\u201d\n\nSullivan says a critical question is whether US telecoms companies remain \u201chighly vulnerable\u201d to hacking from China. \u201cI would say right now, today, they are,\u201d he warns.\n\nI suddenly realise I have been attacking the plain naan that Sullivan ordered and not my garlic naan. But we are focused more on the conversation than our curries, so I hope he has not noticed.\n\nI want to return to the critical issue of Taiwan. Was there ever a time when he worried that Washington and Beijing were heading towards some kind of military conflict?\n\n\u201cBeijing began to develop a perception that the direction of American policy on Taiwan was inexorably toward the end of the status quo,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIf Beijing became convinced there\u2019s only one way to stop Taiwan independence, and it\u2019s grab Taiwan or bomb Taiwan, they would do it,\u201d he warns.\n\nAs a result, it was critical to send a \u201cvery clear message of deterrence\u201d while making clear at the same time that Washington was not trying to upend the status quo.\n\n\u201cThe US and China have kept this delicate balance for decades,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just need to practise a disciplined approach that sustains that out into the future. If we do\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we can sustain it. I do not believe war is inevitable.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Biden made a big bet on India by deepening technology and security co-operation. As Sullivan touts their achievements \u2014 starting with how Biden elevated the Quad grouping of the US, India, Japan and Australia \u2014 our waitress removes his plate. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done very much damage,\u201d I quip. \u201cI\u2019m a light eater,\u201d he says.\n\nThe goal of closer ties with India, I suggest, was not helped by the assassination of a Sikh separatist in Vancouver and a thwarted assassination plot in New York, both suspected of having links to Indian intelligence. Under pressure from the US, New Delhi launched an investigation that remains open after more than a year. Sullivan says it is important to get answers. \u201cI hope the Trump administration will keep pressing.\u201d\n\nI ask how he evaluates the situation in Ukraine. \u201cThe question is, can the current administration display sufficient staying power that Putin sees we\u2019re going to hang in there and the costs are going to continue to mount?\u201d he says. \u201cIn which case, I do believe there\u2019s a deal to be done.\u201d\n\nJust before our lunch, Trump had threatened to hit Russia with more tariffs and sanctions if there was no agreement to end the war, which Sullivan says was a \u201cgood\u201d move.\n\nBiden came under criticism for not providing certain weapons systems, including F-16 fighter jets, as quickly as requested by Kyiv. Sullivan pushes back. Biden approved F-16 transfers in May 2023, but the Ukrainian air force has only 18 jets because, Sullivan explains, it has only 16 pilots trained to fly the sophisticated fighters.\n\nAfter he orders mint tea and I ask for a coffee, Sullivan presses home his point. \u201cThe conventional wisdom that we did too little too late, and if only we had given this weapons system at this time rather than that time something would be dramatically different in the war, is not borne out by any serious review of the evidence,\u201d he says.\n\nWe move on to Iran. Sullivan thinks the regime in Tehran is weaker than at any time since the Iran-Iraq war, which ended in 1988. How does he expect Trump to handle the issue? \u201cI predict a robust debate in this administration between an audacious diplomatic play and an audacious military play,\u201d he responds, prompting me to ask whether he thinks Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be tempted to launch a military strike.\n\n\u201cWithout personalising it to Netanyahu, I would say the senior leadership of Israel, both political and military as well as intelligence, will be sorely tempted to take advantage of this moment.\u201d\n\nI ask about Gaza and whether he believes the Biden administration had the right balance amid criticism that it did not put enough pressure on Netanyahu to stop the killing of civilians.\n\n\u201cThere was immense human suffering in Gaza, and so for me to sit here and say, \u2018No, no, it all went great,\u2019 would display a total lack of human empathy. On the other hand, the idea of cutting weapons off from Israel when they were taking incoming from several fronts all at once\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I\u2019m not sure how I could have justified that. So, it\u2019s hard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the single biggest thing in the four years where only some level of perspective gained over time will allow me to fully judge what I thought we did right and what I thought we didn\u2019t do right.\u201d\n\nWe have been talking for well over two hours. Putting policy questions aside, I want to learn more about the man before our time is up.\n\nAfter four intense years with less than two weeks of vacation, Sullivan\u2019s immediate plans do not involve work. He is flying to Utah to go skiing with friends the next day and is planning a guys\u2019 hiking trip to the Grand Canyon and Horseshoe Bend in Arizona.\n\nHe is also looking forward to reading books after having almost no time in the White House beyond a little \u201cescapist\u201d reading. He played soccer in high school and raves about The Club by Jonathan Clegg and Joshua Robinson, about the Premier League. His interest in English football stems from his time at Oxford university, when he started following Chelsea.\n\nSo, what is next, I ask? His response is refreshingly honest in a city where people are constantly posturing. \u201cThis is a heavy answer,\u201d he starts. \u201cMaggie and I have been over the course of these four years\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009trying to start a family and had some great difficulties,\u201d he continues, referring to a traumatic miscarriage his wife suffered. \u201cMy full-time job is to figure out how we could do that,\u201d Sullivan tells me. \u201cMaybe adoption.\u201d\n\nThey have a house in New Hampshire, which they believe would be a good state in which to raise kids. Sullivan is contemplating taking a position teaching at a university in Boston, which would only be a 45-minute commute.\n\nThe restaurant has almost emptied. As he is about to leave, he says half-jokingly about our lunch interview that he will read it with \u201cgreat anxiety\u201d.\n\nI realise I didn\u2019t notice if he finished his wine. \u201cI believe I did,\u201d he says to my relief. Earlier, I had told him that \u2014 as an Irish citizen \u2014 I would get in trouble with Ireland\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Geraldine Byrne Nason, if I failed to convince the proud Irish-American to have a drink.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m out of work now, so I\u2019m entitled to a glass,\u201d Sullivan quips before heading out into the bitter cold.\n\nDemetri Sevastopulo is the FT\u2019s US-China correspondent\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fae9c36a-99fd-45e7-94ff-2706f838ddcf"}, {"title": "How undercounting immigration skews narratives", "description": "The US and UK have been underestimating population growth but with diverging implications", "author": "John Burn-Murdoch", "published_date": "2025-01-31T05:00:44.845Z", "content": "A curious thing is likely to happen next week: Donald Trump may well be handed positive headlines as a result of record-high immigration. Perhaps more curious still, a similar phenomenon in the UK is instead giving Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves a headache.\n\nIn both cases, the narrative is being shaped by how labour market statistics deal with the revelation that the population is larger than was previously realised. But this plays out in different ways on the two sides of the Atlantic.\n\nLast quarter, Britain\u2019s Office for National Statistics revised upward its estimates of net immigration during the two years ending in December 2023, calculating that around 300,000 more people than initially thought arrived and stayed in the UK, a 20 per cent bump. This increase, as well as some of the updated assumptions beneath the surface, fed into revised population projections published earlier this week.\n\nIf that sounds like a big adjustment, the US Census Bureau then increased its estimates of net immigration for 2022 and 2023 by almost 90 per cent, from 2.1mn to 4mn, adding another 2.8mn for 2024. As a result, US population growth last year is now thought to have been the fastest in decades.\n\nTo be clear: the fact that these revisions happen is a good thing. In both cases, the way immigration is counted is improving, aided in large part by the incorporation of administrative data, which is more accurate and timely than survey-based sources. At any rate, it\u2019s far better to have revisions and more accurate numbers, than no revisions and still the wrong numbers.\n\nBut substantial shifts like these don\u2019t just change what we thought we knew about population size and growth rates. They influence economic indicators too, not least labour market statistics.\n\nNext Friday\u2019s monthly US jobs report, the first of Trump\u2019s second term, will incorporate a raft of revisions to the underlying survey data, among them the dramatic upward adjustment to the population size.\n\nAnalyses from the Brookings Institution and Jed Kolko, formerly a senior economist under Joe Biden, indicate that, contrary to reports last year, the new figures will probably show that native-born Americans are not losing out in the job market relative to immigrants. In fact, US-born employment is growing.\n\nThe old, erroneously low population figures artificially lowered estimated employment levels derived from America\u2019s main household economic survey, causing US-born employment to appear to be falling. In reality, population growth was so high that even though the native-born share had fallen, the native-born number still rose.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, similar revisions have a very different impact. Well-publicised problems with Britain\u2019s labour force survey mean the UK increasingly leans on administrative data to take the temperature of the labour market. And that shows that the number of working-age payrolled employees flatlined for most of last year, before dipping.\n\nCrucially, because these figures are counts based on tax records, not proportions derived from surveys, unexpectedly high population numbers only grow the denominator in the employment rate, not both sides of the equation as in the US. As a result, stagnant UK job numbers translate into a marked deterioration in labour market conditions when viewed against the backdrop of robust immigration-driven population growth.\n\nThe number of working-age UK employees is down 0.2 percentage points year-on-year, but expressed as a proportion of the population the dip is almost a full percentage point \u2014 the deepest since 2008, pandemic aside. Where the rapid labour market loosening of 2008 was mainly driven by a shrinking numerator (job losses), this one comes primarily from an expanding denominator (possibly inflated by jobless arrivals).\n\nThe depth of this downturn is probably a lower bound, since some recent arrivals may be self-employed or in other types of employment that the UK\u2019s tax-based job figures struggle to capture. But the general picture of population growth outpacing job growth is clear.\n\nWhile statistics like the numbers of people and workers in the country might feel solid, the array of revisions and methodological differences highlight the flimsy nature of many narratives that form around them. The picture gets more accurate over time, but there will be blurry moments along the way.\n\njohn.burn-murdoch@ft.com, @jburnmurdoch", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/522d896b-d949-4676-a15c-0d4bff215062"}, {"title": "Trump has made a good start", "description": "A series of early moves has breathed fresh life into the business community", "author": "Michael Strain", "published_date": "2025-01-31T05:00:44.844Z", "content": "The writer is director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute\n\nWall Street\u2019s confidence in US technological leadership was shaken this week with the unveiling of DeepSeek\u2019s latest artificial intelligence model. The Chinese start-up seemed to come out of nowhere.\n\nThis episode should highlight the wisdom of President Donald Trump\u2019s approach to AI. His executive order on the technology is admirably clear: \u201cIt is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America\u2019s global AI dominance.\u201d\u00a0He revoked the policies of the Biden administration, which were \u201cto advance and govern the development and use of AI\u201d in accordance with several goals, including \u201cadvancing equity\u201d and ensuring that AI does not \u201cworsen job quality\u201d or cause \u201charmful labour-force disruptions\u201d.\n\nI am glad to have a president who prioritises AI\u2019s importance to economic prosperity and national security. And this is not the only good move by Trump among the blitz of activity since his inauguration.\n\nHis efforts to deregulate the energy sector and to expand geothermal and nuclear energy production are similarly laudable. They will increase the reliability of electricity supply and reduce energy costs for households and businesses. The new president has already reversed Biden\u2019s foolish pause on new export permits for liquefied natural gas.\n\nMeanwhile, ending Lina Khan\u2019s reign as head of the nation\u2019s antitrust enforcement agency has breathed new life into the business community.\n\nAll this is unleashing animal spirits \u2014 and not just among top bankers and chief executives. Sentiment is surging on Main Street as well.\u00a0In December, the National Federation of Independent Businesses\u2019 small business survey recorded the largest monthly increase since 1983 in the net percentage of companies expecting the economy to improve. This positive sentiment could translate into expansion, innovation and investment, quickening productivity growth and increasing wages.\n\nElsewhere, the new Department of Government Efficiency should be applauded for attempting to increase the efficiency of the federal government.\u00a0Ronald Reagan remarked that \u201ca government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we\u2019ll ever see on this earth\u201d. He made that observation in 1964. Since then, federal government spending as a share of annual GDP has grown by more than 30 per cent. If Doge is able to work with Congress to prove Reagan wrong, all the better.\n\nPublic sector employees hold positions of public trust, and some of Trump\u2019s efforts to hold government workers to higher performance standards are to be welcomed. For example, the vast majority of them should be expected to go to work in their offices five days per week, where they will be most productive and able to generate the highest return on taxpayers\u2019 dollars.\n\nTrump has a different approach on tax, too. The Biden administration wanted to sign up to an international corporate tax cartel, known as Pillar Two, in order to keep other nations from reducing business taxes. Trump wants to further reduce corporate taxes in the US. I\u2019m with him.\n\nThe president was also right to halt the disbursement of $300bn in green energy funding. It would be better to use those funds to finance business tax cuts like full expensing, which would increase investment, productivity and wages.\n\nTrump has been president for less than two weeks, and the ultimate success or failure of all of these initiatives will depend on their specific design, implementation and execution.\u00a0This is especially true of immigration. Deporting, say, 200,000 illegal immigrants this year who have committed serious crimes would be good for the nation. But attempting to deport, say, 2mn illegal immigrants in 2025 would hurt workers, businesses and communities.\n\nSimilarly, if done properly, efforts to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion schemes could increase focus on merit and reduce racial discrimination in the job market. But they could also exacerbate discrimination if handled poorly.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty about the new administration to criticise, to be sure. For example, Trump\u2019s decision to pardon violent January 6 insurrectionists was appalling. On economics, among other examples, his threats to increase tariffs on America\u2019s allies could reduce business investment and weaken international alliances. And he is likely to continue to refuse to cut Medicare and social security spending, which is driving the nation\u2019s unsustainable fiscal trajectory.\n\nBut the president\u2019s critics won\u2019t do themselves any favours by not being open to the good things his administration will do \u2014 and has already done.", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/16ab6569-1719-4b1a-8efb-0790b9f93948"}, {"title": "The threat to Aids sufferers shows how far the Republicans have fallen", "description": "An African aid programme created by George W Bush is casually being endangered by Donald Trump", "author": "Alan Beattie", "published_date": "2025-01-30T11:14:44.000Z", "content": "Ten days into the Trump administration, it\u2019s hard to say which is worse \u2014 the targeted spreading of fear by raids on immigrant workers and native Americans or the wanton destruction caused by the casual suspension of foreign aid. Earlier this week, secretary of state Marco Rubio had to rush to issue an emergency temporary reprieve to the 20mn people, including half a million children, currently being kept alive by antiretroviral drugs under the US Pepfar (President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief) programme, principally in Africa. The edict suspending foreign aid had reportedly already caused some Aids sufferers to be denied drugs, and Pepfar\u2019s future remains uncertain.\n\nPepfar has helped turn a pandemic engulfing much of the continent into just another public health problem to be managed. It\u2019s striking that its creator was George W Bush, like Trump a conservative president who otherwise diminished the US\u2019s reputation abroad and trashed its fiscal probity at home.\n\nThe standard view of acts such as cutting aid is that they are foolish even on the basis of hard-headed self-interest because they diminish the US\u2019s soft power abroad. That\u2019s possibly true, but Pepfar and the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), a separate aid programme set up around the same time by Bush, were not simply crude attempts to buy influence. They proved a genuine good-faith break with decades of cynical American aid that had kept foreign policy clients like Pakistan and Egypt in the US camp but did little to make lives there better off.\n\nAs a reporter then covering aid and development in Washington, it took me some time, amid the administration\u2019s dissembling over the Iraq war and much else, to realise that the Bush aid initiatives were for real. After a while it became obvious and even occasionally amusing that the US was earnestly inventing aid programmes as it went along. The MCA was triumphantly announced ahead of a UN development summit in Mexico in 2002 and then had to be \u201cclarified\u201d a few days later to reveal that the budget was twice as big as first claimed. The rather endearing story at the time was that the White House had simply misunderstood its own numbers.\n\nBush announced Pepfar in a State of the Union speech in 2003, saying it would replicate in other African countries the successful Ugandan model of administering antiretrovirals (ARVs) through a network of medical centre hubs with satellite distribution units. Leaving aside the irony of the Bush administration encouraging a socialist model of centralised public healthcare, the plan again had to be somewhat changed \u2014 one of the main architects being the immunologist Anthony Fauci of Covid pandemic fame \u2014 after it turned out most recipient countries didn\u2019t actually have Uganda\u2019s institutional set-up.\n\nBut Pepfar not only worked, it also challenged development orthodoxy. Rather than painstakingly building systems of public finance and healthcare, it hurled money at a specific problem and got results. It was widely believed mass ARV therapy would not be possible. Pepfar showed it was. The US also overcame its intrinsic suspicion of multilateral initiatives and led the financing of a new \u201cGlobal Fund\u201d to combat Aids, tuberculosis and malaria set up in 2002. Credible estimates are that Pepfar has saved 26mn lives.\n\nThe lobbying that overcame the traditional visceral US resistance to foreign aid also managed to unearth hitherto unsuspected reserves of compassion on Capitol Hill, often linked to religiosity. At the time, I spoke to Republican lawmakers who seemed to have only the sketchiest idea about how development aid worked but had received visits from the rock star Bono, trusted him and were accordingly prepared to spend taxpayers\u2019 money to help Africa.\n\nRemarkably, Bono persuaded North Carolina senator Jesse Helms, the hardline conservative Republican who used to talk about aid going down foreign \u201cratholes\u201d, to fund debt relief and HIV-Aids treatment in developing countries. Helms was won over in particular by the plight of babies born with HIV who were indisputably innocent victims. The general tactic of seeding every development campaign with an emoting celebrity has become tedious, but this was impressive work.\n\nBut the aid programmes weren\u2019t part of a general internationalist mindset. The Republican isolationist tradition remained strong \u2014 and was exploited by Trump with regard to Bush\u2019s Iraq war during campaigning for the presidential nomination in 2016. In fact, Bush himself allowed Iraq to slide into chaos after the disastrous invasion. He was fundamentally not a nation-builder.\n\nThe global Doha round of trade talks in effect collapsed during Bush\u2019s administration, as the US (along with other countries) was not prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to get it to work. Despite Pepfar, US relative influence in Africa continued to diminish, as it had since the end of the cold war. The 2000s was the decade when the Chinese rather than the American footprint expanded over the continent.\n\nPepfar and the other aid programmes simply reflected a moment when campaigners managed to mine a vein of decency in a Republican administration and among lawmakers on Capitol Hill. The fact that it was threatened with casual destruction this week shows how far decency has leached from the White House. If it still exists among Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s hiding very effectively. The world has become darker for it.\n\nalan.beattie@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88b3b032-26b2-40a2-b892-89ab7fadfc01"}, {"title": "The global AI race: Is China catching up to the US?", "description": "The release of DeepSeek\u2019s new model has shaken assumptions about who has the upper hand in developing the technology ", "author": "Richard Waters", "published_date": "2025-01-31T19:14:33.581Z", "content": "On Monday, the world watched as $1tn was wiped off the stock market in a single day, a huge bonfire kindled by the little-known Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek.\n\nIts release of a new AI model, known as R1, upended assumptions about US supremacy in AI and raised the prospect that some in China are learning how to beat Silicon Valley at its own game.\n\nThe model can \u201creason\u201d to solve complex scientific problems and performs at par with leading-edge software from US tech giants, but was apparently developed at a fraction of the price of those models.\n\nIt quickly dislodged OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the US iOS App store.\n\nAlongside the geopolitical challenge, DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough has dual implications for the tech industry. Firstly, it is likely to accelerate the commercial development and uptake of AI, much as ChatGPT did in 2022.\n\nAt the same time, it threatens to demolish investment assumptions that have underpinned the entire US stock market, by seeming to show that developing advanced AI models does not require vast amounts of infrastructure and thus capital.\n\nThe question being asked with sudden urgency from California to Wall Street: Has China caught up in AI at just the moment that many working in the field claim they are on the brink of a historic breakthrough that will put machines on a par with human-level intelligence \u2014 a threshold known as artificial general intelligence?\n\n\u201c[DeepSeek\u2019s] algorithmic innovations remind us that China and the US are neck and neck and that our technological edge isn\u2019t guaranteed, pushing our industry to make AI more efficient,\u201d says Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive and chair of Google.\n\n\u201cTo get to AGI first, we\u2019ll need to continue to invest in talent, support our vibrant open-source ecosystem, and ensure we out-innovate, not just outspend, our competitors.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek was founded on Silicon Valley-style levels of ambition. It started out in 2023 as a side project for the eccentric hedge fund billionaire Liang Wenfeng, just as the race to replicate ChatGPT was heating up. It has since turned into one of China\u2019s leading AI labs.\n\n\u201cWhy is Silicon Valley so innovative? Because they dare to do things,\u201d Liang said in an interview last year. \u201cWhen ChatGPT came out, the tech community in China lacked confidence in frontier innovation.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cFrom investors to [Chinese] big tech, they all thought that the gap was too big and opted to focus on applications instead. But innovation starts with confidence.\u201d\n\nAs state-owned funds in China have taken on a larger role funding start-ups in the past few years, the entrepreneurial ecosystem has felt pressured to guarantee returns for fear of losing the country\u2019s assets.\n\nDeepSeek is distinctive among Chinese generative AI start-ups in that it has not raised any external financing and has therefore been free from these constraints.\n\nA pure research lab, echoing the early days of DeepMind in the UK and OpenAI in the US, DeepSeek has focused all its effort on pushing the field of AI forward, rather than trying to make money. And even though it prides itself on being entirely founded on homegrown talent, it has adopted a culture often found in the US tech heartland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unique among Chinese AI companies,\u201d says an AI investor in China. \u201cThere is no politics or management friction like at the other big tech companies or larger start-ups. People don\u2019t have specific titles or reporting lines.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s origins as a quantitative hedge fund meant it had engineering talent with a deep understanding of chips. Its breakthrough turned on its apparent success at training advanced AI models without spending the hundreds of millions of dollars its US rivals have.\n\nIt claimed that the final training step for R1 cost only $5.6mn. The figure, however, doesn\u2019t include many other costs involved in developing its models, including computing infrastructure and previous training runs, making it hard to draw precise comparisons.\n\nIt may also have cut corners to save costs: OpenAI claims to have evidence that DeepSeek trained on the output from OpenAI\u2019s own models \u2014 not something allowed under its terms of use, though an underhand practice thought to be widely used by US companies as well.\n\nIronically, Washington\u2019s attempt to hamper China\u2019s AI sector by imposing export controls on high-end US chips from 2022 onwards may have contributed to DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough.\n\nWithout access to leading-edge silicon, the company was forced to find innovative ways to squeeze higher performance out of the less sophisticated chips it was able to buy.\n\nThe company\u2019s claims about the low cost and advanced capabilities of its models have touched off a heated debate about how disruptive the company will turn out to be. Silicon Valley\u2019s leaders have paid tribute to its innovations, while also playing down their significance.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the R1 model \u201cimpressive\u201d, while Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Meta, credited the company with making \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems\u201d.\n\nYet Zuckerberg also cast DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough as just one among many in a field that is moving at breakneck speed, making it hard to tell how deeply its low-cost approach would change the dynamics of the industry, he said.\n\nAccording to some China tech watchers, DeepSeek\u2019s advances aren\u2019t significant enough to change the fact that the country\u2019s AI companies have been fast followers, largely devoted to emulating their US counterparts rather than setting the direction themselves.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek\u2019s work falls into that category. What would really turn the tables in US-China competition is if they built something that actually pushed the frontier. We\u2019ll see if they get there,\u201d says Helen Toner, an AI policy analyst at Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, and a former board member at OpenAI.\n\nYet others say that the fact that a Chinese tech start-up has been behind the latest head-turning advance represents a watershed moment, changing the dynamic in the AI race between the two countries.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek\u2019s latest models may not mean that China is pulling ahead of the US in the AI race, but it does prove that Chinese companies are making remarkable strides in software innovation that mitigate the constraints imposed by US export controls,\u201d wrote Tilly Zhang, a China tech analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, a China-focused research firm, in a note published this week.\n\n\u201cThe race for AI leadership is no longer just about who has access to the best chips, but about who puts them to best use.\u201d\n\nWhile the significance of DeepSeek\u2019s technical breakthroughs is a matter of debate, there is no mistaking the shockwave that passed through the stock market as investors digested the implications of its main innovation: dramatically cutting the cost of training for the most advanced AI models.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s models appear to undermine the argument that US AI companies have made vociferously over the past year: that AI advances require vast amounts of capital and infrastructure to develop and deploy their technology at scale.\n\nInstead, they suggest that far more expensive, US-developed models would have little to differentiate them, raising fears among investors of a sharp deflationary shock.\n\n\u201cThere was a sense of American exceptionalism \u2014 that only America had this technology, and only Americans had the money to do this,\u201d says Jim Tierney, a US growth stock investor at AllianceBernstein. \u201cThe commoditisation of these models is happening much faster than we thought.\u201d\n\nMuch of Silicon Valley fell back on the argument that others in the industry will quickly copy DeepSeek\u2019s innovations, bringing down the cost of training AI models across the board. Executives like Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella claimed it will make the technology more affordable for customers and boost its use \u2014 something that would benefit the entire industry.\n\nIn a sign of the company\u2019s confidence in its status, DeepSeek has published its research and released its models in \u201copen-weights\u201d form, a more limited version of open-source software that allows anyone to download, use and modify the technology.\n\nThe move will attract a wide international following among software developers looking for \u201copen\u201d models to build applications on. Most models developed by Silicon Valley\u2019s leading AI companies remain closed, though there are exceptions \u2014 notably Meta, whose open models have surged in popularity.\n\nBut Deepseek\u2019s model is accessible at a far lower cost. The Chinese company says it charges only 1.4 cents for each 1mn tokens it generates \u2014 roughly equivalent to 700,000 words. By contrast, Meta charges $2.80 for the same output from its largest models.\n\n\u201cA whole number of developers are experimenting with what\u2019s now a Chinese open source AI-based solution,\u201d says Keegan McBride, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute who focuses on the geopolitics of AI. \u201cIt really shows that in the AI space, the US isn\u2019t the only option on the table.\u201d\n\nWhile Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, described DeepSeek in glowing terms as proof that \u201copen-source models are surpassing proprietary ones\u201d, the start-up nonetheless poses a direct challenge to Meta.\n\nThe company\u2019s \u201cclaim to fame has been creating open-weight models that aren\u2019t too far behind the bleeding edge, and DeepSeek just beat them at their own game,\u201d says Toner.\n\nBeyond Deepseek\u2019s impact on the market for AI products, its breakthrough also promises to have geopolitical repercussions, coming at what many believe is a pivotal moment in the competition between the US and China for AI supremacy.\n\nIf R1 and its successors become the global standard for \u201copen\u201d AI models, it would handicap the US, warned Meta\u2019s Zuckerberg. \u201cFor our national advantage, it\u2019s important that it\u2019s an American standard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to build the AI system that people around the world are using.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek has \u201caccelerated the urgency for people in every country to assess\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the technological balance of power emerging between various countries,\u201d says Craig Mundie, a Microsoft veteran and former White House adviser, who counsels OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman on tech policy and strategy.\n\nIf China has managed to get on to an equal footing with the US on AI, it has implications for everything that the technology could eventually be used for, warned Dario Amodei, CEO of US AI start-up Anthropic.\n\n\u201cIt seems likely that China could direct more talent, capital and focus to military applications of the technology,\u201d Amodei wrote of DeepSeek\u2019s advances. \u201cCombined with its large industrial base and military-strategic advantages, this could help China take a commanding lead on the global stage, not just for AI but for everything.\u201d\n\nMundie, who also chairs the US-China AI Dialogue diplomatic forum established by the late US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, pointed out that AI was the \u201cultimate dual use technology\u201d, meaning it has both positive and dangerous purposes.\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek is likely to hang over discussions when the diplomatic group convenes within the next 90 days to discuss a multilateral but common safety structure for AI software, which Mundie writes about in his latest book Genesis, co-authored with Kissinger and Schmidt.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean everyone will have the same laws or rules, but [building] the architecture by which these machines grow up understanding human values and comport with societal choices everywhere in the world, I think is an urgent task,\u201d Mundie says.\n\nMeanwhile, aspiring young entrepreneurs in China are looking towards DeepSeek and its founder as inspiration to build a new generation of powerful technology.\n\nA teenager who came to pay respects at Liang\u2019s house in the village of Mililing this week says: \u201cHe is a pragmatic technologist. He put together a team that\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009surpassed those of companies like OpenAI that we couldn\u2019t compete with before. He is a great person who has made contributions to China.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Melissa Heikkila in London", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0e8d6f24-6d45-4de0-b209-8f2130341bae"}, {"title": "Donald Trump\u2019s plan for space lasers to destroy nuclear weapons", "description": "US president orders work on defence shield going beyond Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u2018Star Wars\u2019 programme", "author": "Joe Miller", "published_date": "2025-01-30T05:00:10.856Z", "content": "Donald Trump this week ordered work on the most ambitious missile shield in US history, one designed to destroy hypersonic missiles and prevent nuclear annihilation.\n\nThe US president dubbed it the \u201cIron Dome for America\u201d \u2014 a nod to Israel\u2019s renowned air defence system.\n\nBut the vision for Trump\u2019s next-generation system, including space-based lasers, is actually much closer to Ronald Reagan\u2019s so-called Star Wars programme, launched in 1983 at the height of the cold war.\n\nDeveloping a kind of Star Wars 2.0 would cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The technological challenges it faces are immense. Nuclear experts also warned the initiative could provoke China and Russia to take countermeasures that would nullify its effects. It is partly why the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists moved its \u201cDoomsday clock\u201d one second closer to midnight this week.\n\nThe US president\u2019s executive order, signed on Monday, gives defence secretary Pete Hegseth 60 days to flesh out a plan to defend the US against ballistic, hypersonic and advanced cruise missile attack.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposed system, outlined in the memo, is comprehensive, extraordinarily expensive and a different order of technical sophistication from Israel\u2019s Iron Dome.\n\nThat system defends only small areas from short-range, low-flying and non-nuclear missiles. Trump\u2019s initiative seeks to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles that travel 100 times further and seven times faster. The US is also almost 450 times bigger than Israel.\n\nInstead, Trump\u2019s order demands the deployment of \u201cspace-based interceptors\u201d \u2014 a web of satellites, some equipped with lasers. It then calls for the development of another layer of lower-altitude interceptors if the lasers fail.\n\nIn addition, it demands \u201ccapabilities to defeat missile attacks prior to launch\u201d\u00a0\u2014 in other words, a system that destroys the archer, not just the arrow.\n\nAnalysts say that a leakproof, space-based missile shield is all but impossible. \u201cThere is no magical security blanket,\u201d said Tom Karako, a leading missile expert at the CSIS think-tank in Washington.\n\nTo detect, intercept and destroy ballistic nuclear missiles during their so- called boost phase, the three- to five-minute period before they enter orbit, would require laser beams effective over hundreds of kilometres. No such technology currently exists.\n\nIn part that is due to \u201cthermal blooming\u201d, whereby the energy from a laser heats up the atmosphere surrounding it and reduces the beam\u2019s potency. While the effect is small in the near vacuum of outer space, it is much greater once the beam hits the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nPowering the satellites that fire the lasers would also require them to have mini nuclear reactors, or perhaps an advanced system of solar panels. \u201cThat\u2019s not impossible but\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009would require a major research and investment effort that couldn\u2019t be completed in the short term,\u201d said Fabian Hoffmann, a missile expert at the Oslo Nuclear Project.\n\nThen there are costs, which Trump would need to convince Congress to fund.\n\nA 2012 report by the National Academy of Science found that \u201ceven an austere and limited-capability\u201d space-based defence system would require 650 satellites at a cost of $300bn. It also warned that it would be vulnerable to anti-satellite weapons \u2014 such as the space-based nuclear weapons that Russia has developed recently, according to US intelligence.\n\n\u201cSpace-based missile defences\u00a0have repeatedly been abandoned because they are expensive, very technically challenging and readily defeated,\u201d said Laura Grego, research director for the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nEffective technologies already exist. Ukraine has successfully used western-supplied systems \u2014 such as US-made Patriots and the German-manufactured IRIS-T \u2014 to destroy incoming Russian ballistic and hypersonic missiles.\n\nThe problem, again, is cost. The US already has a $60bn ground-based midcourse missile defence programme. This consists of 44 interceptors, deployed in Alaska and California, which are designed to knock out rogue long-range missiles from foes such as North Korea.\n\nBut as each one costs upwards of $50mn, expanding that system to cover all the US would be vastly expensive.\n\n\u201cOne cannot put active defences everywhere that would be needed to defend cities, critical infrastructure and military sites,\u201d said Stacie Pettyjohn of the Center for a New American Security think-tank.\n\nMoreover, a 2000 technical analysis\u00a0found that even a less-developed country such as North Korea could use long-understood countermeasures, such as decoys or a \u201ccooled shroud\u201d that covers the nuclear warhead to confound heat-seeking interceptor missiles.\n\n\u201cCurrent homeland missile defence systems, despite decades of development, may not even reliably counter rogue state threats,\u201d said Zhao Tong, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\u201cAchieving comprehensive defence against Russia and China\u2019s vastly larger missile arsenals would require astronomical spending without unprecedented technological breakthroughs,\u201d he added.\n\nEven a moderately successful Star Wars 2.0 would strip Russia and China of their retaliatory capability and could prompt them to embark on an accelerated arms race in order to retain nuclear parity.\n\n\u201cIf one [nuclear power] can show it can defend itself while also having first- strike capability [for its nuclear weapons], that is destabilising,\u201d said Manpreet Sethi, head of the nuclear programme at the Centre for Air Power Studies in New Delhi.\n\n\u201cIt is an offensive threat that major power rivals cannot and will not ignore,\u201d said Eric Heginbotham, an expert on Chinese nuclear issues at MIT. \u201cOur\u00a0intent may be defensive\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but whatever the intent, if the capabilities are real, this will be regarded as a critical offensive threat.\u201d\n\nAdversaries could then take easily available countermeasures. Russia, for example, could load more nuclear warheads on existing ballistic missiles, or target areas with weaker defences.\n\n\u201cAdversaries could simply redirect attacks to numerous unprotected population centres \u2014 rendering the defence of select locations strategically meaningless,\u201d Zhao said.\n\nAnalysts argued that a more sober approach would involve the US working to limit countries\u2019 strategic nuclear arsenals \u2014 something Trump backed in a recent speech at Davos.\n\nConventional missile threats could meanwhile be addressed by beefing up lower-altitude systems, based on the ground or US naval ships. The cost would still be huge, but such an approach would be technically feasible and potentially avoid another arms race.\n\n\u201cThe US should focus on strengthening lower-layer missile defences while striving to maintain the current balance of power in the nuclear domain,\u201d Hoffmann said.\n\nThe space-based part of the programme would require hundreds\u00a0of carrier satellites to be launched \u2014 a market currently dominated by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\nAlthough the US government has other contractors capable of sending carrier satellites into space, Musk\u2019s rockets have a higher payload capacity, higher payload volume and are substantially cheaper than most competitors. They\u00a0are also being launched at much greater\u00a0frequency, with one launch on average every three days last year.\n\n\u201cA lot of people stand to make money,\u201d said Grego of the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nThere would be trade-offs, however. SpaceX already has $20bn worth of government\u00a0contracts and would probably have to sacrifice capacity reserved for populating its Starlink constellation \u2014 the company\u2019s biggest revenue driver.\n\nAll this assumes the space-based programme, which Grego described as a \u201cfantasy\u201d, will be approved by Congress and goes ahead.\n\nCartography by Steven Bernard", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/62c01967-0100-46ee-9f4f-e9af467d7604"}, {"title": "With DeepSeek, China innovates and the US imitates ", "description": "The start-up\u2019s breakthrough confounds outworn prejudices about the two countries  ", "author": "John Thornhill", "published_date": "2025-01-30T12:37:16.931Z", "content": "Triumphalist glee lit up the Chinese internet this week. Just as Google DeepMind\u2019s victory over China\u2019s strongest Go player in 2017 showcased western brilliance in artificial intelligence, so DeepSeek\u2019s release of a world-beating AI reasoning model has this month been celebrated as a stunning success in China.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s smarter and cheaper AI model was a \u201cscientific and technological achievement that shapes our national destiny\u201d, said one Chinese tech executive. The start-up had become a key player in the \u201cChinese Large-Model Technology Avengers Team\u201d that would counter US AI dominance, said another.\n\nChina\u2019s delight, however, spelled pain for several giant US technology companies as investors questioned whether DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough undermined the case for their colossal spending on AI infrastructure. US tech and energy stocks lost $1tn of their market value on Monday, although they regained some ground later in the week.\n\nThe stereotypical image of China abroad may still be that of a state-subsidised, capital-intensive manufacturing economy that excels at churning out impressive low-cost hardware, such as smartphones, solar panels and electric vehicles. But, in truth, China long ago emerged as a global software superpower, outstripping the west in ecommerce and digital financial services, and it has invested massively in AI, too.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s emergence confounds many of the outworn prejudices about Chinese innovation, although it is far from a typical Chinese company. It certainly invalidates the old saw that while the US innovates, China imitates and Europe regulates. In several ways, DeepSeek resembles a bootstrapped Silicon Valley start-up, even if it was not founded in a garage. Launched in 2023, the company has the same high-flown ambition as OpenAI and Google DeepMind to attain human-level AI, or artificial general intelligence (AGI). But its founder Liang Wenfeng runs one of China\u2019s leading hedge funds, meaning the company has not had to raise external financing.\n\nIn an interview republished in the China Talk newsletter, Liang explained that DeepSeek operated more as a research lab than a commercial enterprise. When recruiting, it prioritised capabilities over credentials, hiring young Chinese-educated researchers. Liang said these people were given the space to explore and the freedom to make mistakes. \u201cInnovation often arises naturally \u2014 it\u2019s not something that can be deliberately planned or taught,\u201d he said.\n\nDeepSeek relies on open-source AI models, such as Meta\u2019s Llama, in contrast to the proprietary models favoured by OpenAI and Google. It also focuses narrowly on language in its quest to reach AGI rather than attempting to go multimodal and incorporating images, audio and video. \u201cWhat you think of as \u2018thinking\u2019 might actually be your brain weaving language. This suggests that humanlike AGI could potentially emerge from language models,\u201d he said.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s focused approach has enabled it to develop a compelling reasoning model without the need for extraordinary computing power and seemingly at a fraction of the cost of its US competitors. As with other Chinese apps, US politicians have been quick to raise security and privacy concerns about DeepSeek. And OpenAI has even accused the Chinese company of possible breaches of intellectual property rights. Given the cases against OpenAI for infringing others\u2019 copyright, though, that might strike some as rich.\n\nWhile some big US tech companies responded to DeepSeek\u2019s model with disguised alarm, many developers were quick to pounce on the opportunities the technology might generate. The capabilities and cheapness of DeepSeek\u2019s reasoning model may allow them to deploy it for an ever-expanding number of uses. On Monday, DeepSeek was the most downloaded free app on the US Apple App Store.\n\nIronically, that may yet enable the US to benefit more from DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough than China. Over the past few years, China has been throttling its own private sector as the state has exerted tighter control. The number of start-ups launched in China has plummeted since 2018. According to PitchBook, venture capital funding in China fell 37 per cent to $40.2bn last year while rising strongly in the US.\n\nDeepSeek has punctured the hubris of the US tech oligarchs. It has intensified global competition and will accelerate the adoption of AI tools. Temporarily this could be a case of China innovating and the US imitating. But is it just a spectacular blip or the start of a long-term trend?\n\njohn.thornhill@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d72e0750-6a8b-4ef4-b9e1-6d35fd2a69b8"}, {"title": "\u2018Back to 1897\u2019: Latin America scrambles to respond to Donald Trump\u2019s aggression", "description": "Colombia\u2019s President Gustavo Petro finds little support for confrontational stance against US", "author": "Joe Daniels", "published_date": "2025-01-27T19:18:11.615Z", "content": "Latin American presidents will hold an emergency summit on Thursday to respond to President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportations of migrants as they reel from his aggressive tactics towards two of Washington\u2019s traditional regional allies.\n\nTrump clamped 25 per cent tariffs on trade with Colombia and imposed visa and other sanctions on Sunday after leftwing President Gustavo Petro turned back US military flights deporting migrants. The confrontation ended within hours after Bogot\u00e1 caved in to Washington\u2019s demands.\n\nThe dramatic clash, much of it conducted over social media, unsettled Latin American nations already scared by Trump\u2019s threats of military force to re-establish US control over the Panama Canal and of steep tariffs on Mexico, the US\u2019s biggest trading partner.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of alarm among the Latin American embassies in Washington,\u201d said a senior regional diplomat in Washington. \u201cWe seem to have gone back to 1897 and the era of President [William] McKinley, who invaded Cuba and the Philippines.\u201d\n\nEmerging market currencies were rattled by Sunday\u2019s dispute, with the Mexican peso and South African rand both falling about two per cent against the US dollar. Colombia\u2019s peso fell 1.5 per cent against the dollar on Monday morning before recovering a little ground.\n\nPanama, a nation of just 4.5mn people with no army and a heavy dependence on US trade and investment, is seen as particularly vulnerable to Trump\u2019s demands for Washington to take back control of the canal it built more than a century ago. The US president has claimed China now operates the canal and US shipping is being \u201cripped off\u201d by the charges to use the waterway.\n\nHonduran President Xiomara Castro called an emergency summit of the region\u2019s leaders in her capacity as head of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac), after a request by Petro. The meeting will discuss migration, the environment and regional unity, she said on X.\n\nMichael Shifter, a senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue think-tank in Washington, said Latin American leaders were unlikely to defer to Trump.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to try to strike a balance,\u201d he said, \u201crecognising that on the one hand, they have to be pragmatic because Trump is actually capable of imposing sanctions, which would be very painful for these countries. On the other side, they really have to save face as well and show they have national pride and protect sovereignty.\u201d\n\nRussian allies Cuba and Venezuela gave swift backing to Petro, a former guerrilla with a long record of rants against US policy on social media on issues ranging from Gaza to the war on drugs. But the region\u2019s biggest powers, Brazil and Mexico, did not comment publicly.\n\nDiplomats said they wanted to co-ordinate positions discreetly and let the dust settle before taking a public stance.\n\n\u201cPetro has given a lesson in how not to deal with Trump,\u201d said a second regional diplomat. \u201cHe went into battle on social media without having a way to sustain his fight.\u201d\n\nSeveral commentators pointed out the Colombian leader had undermined his own position by previously agreeing to take US military flights deporting migrants, which date back years under Democrat and Republican administrations.\n\nColombia, traditionally the closest US ally in South America, is heavily reliant on the US market for its exports of oil, coffee and cut flowers, and has little leverage with Washington.\n\nThe timing was also awkward, with Colombia\u2019s foreign minister Luis Gilberto Murillo \u2014 a pragmatic English speaker and ex-ambassador to Washington \u2014 due to be replaced on February 1 by Laura Sarabia, Petro\u2019s 30-year-old chief of staff, who has no diplomatic experience.\n\nWith Petro\u2019s whereabouts on Sunday unclear, a crisis team made up of Sarabia, Murillo and other officials met in the presidential palace and the foreign ministry headquarters. The main interlocutor on the US side, diplomats said, was Mauricio Claver-Carone, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Latin America in the state department. \u201cPetro was in constant communication, always listening and responding,\u201d said a person with direct knowledge of the talks.\n\nBruce Mac Master, president of Colombia\u2019s main business association, spent the day lobbying Petro\u2019s diplomatic team, and spoke with Sarabia several times.\n\n\u201cI think Petro had no idea of the dimensions and impact of US relations,\u201d Mac Master said. \u201cHe soon realised that the effects would be felt everywhere, starting with the exchange rate. I think he learned more about economics from that than he had in the rest of his life.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Mexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum is seen in the region as having handled Trump better. She has made her disagreements with US policy clear in measured public comments, while privately agreeing to many of Trump\u2019s demands on taking back migrants and cracking down on fentanyl trafficking.\n\nChina has hugely expanded its trade and investment in Latin America this century, and Beijing is likely to view Trump\u2019s unpredictable moves as an ideal opportunity to present itself as a more reliable partner, diplomats and analysts said.\n\nShifter, of Inter-American Dialogue, said: \u201cCelac is the platform for China in Latin America, so Thursday\u2019s summit is a kind of proxy for showing [Washington] that if [it is] really going to punish us, then China\u2019s willing to fill the gap and come in even more than it has already.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Tommy Stubbington in London", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/feaa544c-ca50-46f1-aeb0-770d190fdf14"}, {"title": "Where \u2018woke\u2019 went wrong\u00a0", "description": "Seemingly irresistible just a few years ago, movements aimed at addressing systemic inequalities are now in retreat. Can they recover?", "author": "Henry Mance", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.807Z", "content": "All revolutions face a backlash. A few years ago, Elon Musk and other supporters of Donald Trump started denouncing the \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d. In 2023, the US Supreme Court ruled that affirmative action in university admissions was illegal. Rightwing activists began preparing legal warfare against companies with high-profile diversity initiatives.\n\nSince becoming president, Trump has ordered an end to federal government diversity efforts, including some dating back to Lyndon Johnson, and may expel trans people from the US military. Walmart and Amazon are among the companies closing down their own diversity schemes. Mark Zuckerberg, who had once celebrated Facebook\u2019s role in making #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter viral, now said its parent company needed more \u201cmasculine energy\u201d and would end its targets for hiring women and minorities.\u00a0Corporate America had gone from taking the knee to bending it.\n\nBut perhaps equally telling has been the loss of faith among the revolution\u2019s natural supporters. Kamala Harris, who once criticised Joe Biden\u2019s record on desegregation, backed away from wokeness. (Trump ads still said: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d) In the UK Keir Starmer changed his view on trans rights. Between 2021 and 2024, the proportion of British people who said efforts to ensure equal opportunities for trans people hadn\u2019t gone far enough fell from 32 per cent to 22 per cent.\n\nProgressive activists could once insist that criticisms of their causes were confected. This has become harder. The critics included people, such as philosophers Sam Harris and Susan Neiman, who define themselves as on the left.\n\nThe achievement of Black Lives Matter was to make support almost the default option. Shortly after George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis in 2020, protesters\u2019 signs read simply: \u201cWhite silence is violence.\u201d The movement was not hoping to persuade people. It was expecting them to participate.\n\nIn this, Black Lives Matter was initially hugely successful. Within weeks of Floyd\u2019s murder, perhaps 20mn Americans, an unprecedented number, went on marches. Government policies were examined for implicit bias. Bosses looked around their offices and asked why they were so white. Workshops were organised, donations promised, senior appointments made. Statues were felled; company logos based on Black stereotypes were replaced.\n\nIn the years before, other movements had similar success. #MeToo called out male sexual abuse. LGBT+ campaigners highlighted the difficulties faced by trans people. After the celebrated expansion of gay rights, lots of people wanted to be on the right side of history. They added rainbows to their online profiles and pronouns to their email signatures. Trans celebrities became sought-after brand ambassadors.\n\nToday, however, many progressives have decided that speaking up is no longer so urgent. Silence has resumed. If these movements are to rise again, they need to overcome not just their opponents, but their own limitations.\n\nThe term \u201cwoke\u201d emerged from the American Black community to describe awareness of the injustices faced by Black people, later gaining currency among the wider left. Critics on the right took the word and made it pejorative, just as they weaponised \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d in the 1990s. Today they often deploy it disingenuously.\n\nWokeness \u2014 there is still no better term \u2014 now describes attempts to address systemic inequalities faced by disadvantaged groups, including women, people of colour, LGBT+ people and those with disabilities. It assumes that people can discriminate unconsciously by upholding inequitable norms.\n\nTo many supporters, these attempts continued campaigns such as the US civil rights movement. Those past revolutions had been only partly successful. The killing of Floyd, and others such as teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, showed that the law was still not equally applied to Black people in the US. Old inequalities persisted. New ones emerged: tech companies apologised after their algorithms generated racist results.\n\nIf wokeness faced resistance, supporters could point to those who had opposed civil rights in the 1960s, or who had moaned about the suppression of sexist and racist jokes in the 1990s.\n\nThe problem, as writer Yascha Mounk argues in his book The Identity Trap, is that the new activism was built on a rejection of the civil rights movement\u2019s optimistic pursuit of equality and racial integration. Its foundations lay in the post-structuralism of Michel Foucault, in postcolonial studies and in critical race theory. Derrick Bell, founder of critical race theory, argued in 1991 that Black people in the US had in effect seen no progress since slavery, and that yearning for racial equality was a \u201cfantasy\u201d.\n\nBell\u2019s precise words may not have spread widely, but examples of woke over-reach did. In 2020-21, Black Lives Matter activists occupied the city of Portland for months, causing millions of dollars of damage. Calls to \u201cdefund the police\u201d complicated law enforcement in many US cities, allowing critics to question if it was inadvertently making life more dangerous, not less.\n\nLess grave, but equally eye-catching, was some counterintuitive theorising. Some descriptions of racial equity suggested that punctuality was a trait of \u201cwhiteness\u201d. Some trans rights activists adopted the terms \u201cLatinx\u201d and \u201cpeople who menstruate\u201d \u2014 terms that most of the people they were referring to would reject.\n\nIn the 1990s, political correctness meant saying \u201cchair\u201d instead of \u201cchairman\u201d, and \u201csex worker\u201d instead of \u201cprostitute\u201d (the idea of calling short people \u201cvertically challenged\u201d came from critics). Recent conceptual and linguistic shifts were arguably much sharper. \u201cWhite privilege\u201d, \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d and \u201ccisgender\u201d entered the lexicon.\n\nEven away from these extremes, \u201cwokeness\u201d clashed with some tenets of liberal society. It defined people as being part of a group, not as individuals. It encouraged people to identify as Black, queer or whatever else. For Robin DiAngelo, the white author of the bestselling book White Fragility, white people were inherently racist.\n\nAll this ran counter to the civil rights era\u2019s focus on equality and to how many citizens wished to see themselves. As early as 2015, veteran civil rights activist Barbara Reynolds argued that Black Lives Matter was mistaken in not claiming the slogan \u201call lives matter\u201d for its own (and for not adopting the church-inspired respectability of 1960s protesters).\n\nInside companies, group awareness was initially welcomed: staff networks for Black, Asian, LGBT+, disabled people and others sprung up. But bosses now admit to second thoughts. \u201cWere we beginning to focus too much on all these areas of difference, versus saying this is fundamentally about inclusion and respecting difference, rather than necessarily needing to call it out?\u201d says Peter Cheese, chief executive of CIPD, the UK\u2019s body for HR professionals. \u201cWe can\u2019t deal with every aspect of people\u2019s difference at work.\u201d\n\nCompanies invested in anti-bias training, including from DiAngelo. But some evidence suggested that it had little effect. While diversity programmes focused on race and gender, conversations on class were often lacking. \u201c[Employees would say,] what do you mean \u2018white privilege\u2019? I came from a working-class background and I\u2019ve worked my way up,\u201d says Kamal Munir, a professor at Cambridge\u2019s Judge Business School. \u201cIt was also seen as a zero-sum game.\u201d\n\nClass wasn\u2019t the only blind spot. The epithet \u201cKaren\u201d emerged to refer to entitled white women: it went from light-hearted meme to blatant sexism. In May 2023, Uber\u2019s head of diversity left after employees complained that her \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Karen\u201d training sessions were too focused on white people\u2019s hardships.\n\nA key demand for campaigners was the representation of disadvantaged groups. This had liberating effects. After #OscarsSoWhite went viral in 2015, when all 20 acting nominations went to white people, more actors of colour started to be recognised. Representation was long overdue. But it is not the whole ballgame. Does Emilia P\u00e9rez, a Netflix film about Mexican cartel violence, not deserve its Oscar nominations because it was made by mostly non-Mexican cast and crew? As the director pointed out in his defence, Shakespeare never went to Verona. In 2021, an award-winning, non-binary Dutch novelist, chosen to translate the work of the Black American poet Amanda Gorman, stepped down after criticism that a Black translator should do the job.\n\nIn less high-profile contexts, who was speaking came to overshadow what they said. It can be powerful, and funny, to question an opinion on the basis that it comes from a white man. Deployed repetitively, it short-circuits debate. Listening to speakers preface their comments with their identity became exhausting.\n\nActivists also set about changing what it was acceptable to say, or be associated with. Ibram X Kendi, author of the bestselling book How to Be an Antiracist, apologised for using \u201cableist\u201d terms such as \u201ccrazy\u201d, \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cdumb\u201d. Robin DiAngelo listed things white people should not say, including: \u201cI can\u2019t say anything right.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, the football team LA Galaxy released a player after his wife posted racist messages on Instagram, even though he disavowed them (he became the Serbian Super League\u2019s top scorer). A British children\u2019s author was dropped by her publisher for expressing support for JK Rowling\u2019s views on trans issues (she became a truck driver).\n\nThis strictness was politically inadvisable. In 2018 and again in 2021, a majority of Americans said they didn\u2019t want political correctness to go further. Barack Obama rightly judged that voters didn\u2019t want to feel as though they were \u201cwalking on eggshells\u201d; they wanted acknowledgment that \u201clife is messy\u201d.\n\nIn its purer forms, wokeness offered not tolerance and debate, but punishment and re-education. This was intellectually wrong. Many people could accept that racial discrimination existed, and that Floyd\u2019s murder was horrific. But they disagreed with the weight that activists put on discrimination. A US survey found that white progressives were more likely than Black and Hispanic people to say that racism is built into US society \u2014 and less likely to say that most people can get ahead if they work hard.\n\nRadical societal changes deserved debate. This was most notable on trans issues. Did giving puberty blockers to children raise questions of informed consent and long-term health risks? Even asking such questions was frowned upon, right up to 2024, when a review of NHS England\u2019s gender identity service concluded the use of puberty blockers rested on \u201cweak evidence\u201d.\n\nLGBT+ campaigners had reasons for not wishing to be drawn into such debates. As Shon Faye argued in her book The Transgender Issue, media framing could itself be oppressive. Trans people felt their existence mocked. Many also distrusted the medical establishment, which they felt had neglected their needs. There was a view that questioning trans campaigners\u2019 outlook made trans people less safe \u2014 both psychologically, but also physically, because it could lead to policy changes where trans healthcare was further restricted.\n\nBut the result was unsatisfactory. Trans activists often labelled their critics as \u201ctransphobic\u201d. The public had signed up to colourful LGBT+ Pride rainbows; they now often saw toxic social media debates. (Critics also bore much responsibility for the toxicity.) For many who were gently supportive of the cause, it marked trans issues as worth steering clear of.\n\nEventually the law defended free speech. In 2021, a British employment tribunal ruled that a woman called Maya Forstater had been unlawfully discriminated against, when her contract was not renewed because of her gender-critical views.\n\nSimilarly, racial diversity efforts clashed with basic employment rules. Previously employers could talk about hiring a candidate from a more diverse background if two candidates were equal. This was always dubious: two candidates are never equal, and a thumb could always be placed on the scales in one direction or another.\n\nAround 2020, some organisations wanted to go faster in hiring diverse candidates. (Being a woman, or Jewish, was probably not sufficient.) At least in some cases, they clearly discriminated against white employees. In 2022 Britain\u2019s Thames Valley Police promoted an Asian officer without a competitive process; three white officers who weren\u2019t given the chance to apply later won a discrimination claim. Perhaps the law should give employers greater leeway to address society\u2019s inequalities. But it did not. Again, the managers who wanted to drive change from the inside, and the activists on the outside, were moving faster than liberal society, and most people\u2019s sense of fairness, could handle.\n\nThe intense social activism of mid-2020 \u2014 heightened by outrage at the Trump presidency, and perhaps the emotional strain of Covid \u2014 was never sustainable. By April 2024, 52 per cent of Americans thought the US had done enough to make up for past discrimination against Black people. 2020 showed how permeable companies were to prevailing political winds. Those winds became the economy and immigration.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s hard to disentangle the rise and fall of \u201cwoke\u201d from US politics. This month, when Zuckerberg rolled back Meta\u2019s diversity initiatives, and changed its moderation policies so that users could post things such as \u201cGays are freaks\u201d, the company explained: \u201cIt\u2019s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms.\u201d For less spineless bosses too, the changing political moment was useful cover to push back at activists\u2019 and diversity managers\u2019 strictures.\n\nThe woke revolution might have lasted longer had progressives not been so sceptical of universal ideas and free debate. Voters are not part of an anti-woke crusade. Trans issues don\u2019t register in British voters\u2019 priorities. A majority of Britons support supposedly woke ideas, like returning the Parthenon marbles to Greece. Two-thirds of Americans support DEI programmes. But many of them did become disengaged from the movements that they had once supported.\n\nThis might have been more manageable if activists were as well-organised as their most cynical opponents. Instead, Black Lives Matter lacked established leaders and structures. (In both the US and the UK, activists were jailed for fraudulent use of donations.) Soon progressives had also lost arguably their most influential social network, Twitter: it soured with abuse, then was corrupted by Musk.\n\nWere he alive, Derrick Bell might argue that the backlash is proof that racism always reasserts itself. But for believers in progress, the woke revolution can claim plenty of victories. It aimed higher than the move to political correctness, and it propelled forward awareness of race, gender and sexual identity. Within corporations, \u201ca lot of progress was made\u201d, says Munir at the University of Cambridge. \u201cPeople did make a lot of effort to tap more diverse talent pools. [But] progress is never linear.\u201d\n\nThe fate of diversity initiatives dovetails with that of climate policies. Just because climate action is less politically fashionable does not mean it is less urgent. And just because Black Lives Matter and trans rights are no longer the zeitgeist does not mean economic and social disparities have been closed. \u201cSilence is violence\u201d is one of many things that progressive activists were wrong about.

Is it Mount McKinley or Mount Denali? For Google Maps users, the answer will depend on whether you live in Donald Trump\u2019s America or the rest of the world.\n\nIn complying with Trump\u2019s insistence on renaming the gulf and America\u2019s highest mountain, Google said this week it had \u201ca longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources\u201d.\n\nUsers of the app outside America will continue to see existing names, but this is unlikely to satisfy Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum. Before Trump\u2019s inauguration, she took a swipe at his plans to retitle the gulf. Vast tracts of the US that once formed part of the Spanish empire and later Mexico might be renamed \u201cAm\u00e9rica Mexicana\u201d, she suggested.\n\nGoogle isn\u2019t the first and will assuredly not be the last mapmaker to fall in line with a government\u2019s wishes. Down the centuries, maps have served ideological, imperialistic, religious and cultural purposes more often than impartial scholarship \u2014 as Mark Monmonier, a US geographer, sets out in his book, How to Lie with Maps.\n\nGreat powers have a penchant for maps that express territorial claims or national grandeur. In recent years, China has held a \u201cnational mapping awareness publicity week\u201d, encouraging citizens to think of Taiwan and parts of the maritime zones of nearby Asian countries as Chinese.\n\nIn Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, the government has used anti-extremism laws to clamp down on maps that question whether Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in 2014, or the Kuril Islands, seized from Japan in 1945, belong to Russia.\n\nSmaller countries are just as likely to get in on the act. Since the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia gained independence in 1991, a long-running sore in relations with Greece and Bulgaria has been the use of nationalist maps that include parts of both countries as \u201cGreater Macedonia\u201d.\n\nViktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, promotes maps that show his country with pre-first world war borders, including areas of modern Croatia, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia. Ludovic Orban, Romania\u2019s former premier, once brushed these efforts off with a Romanian proverb \u2014 \u201cthe sparrow dreams of the dough\u201d \u2014 implying Hungary\u2019s leader was indulging in fantasy.\n\nDuring the cold war, even weather forecasts contained political messages. West Germany\u2019s ARD network displayed Germany with pre-second world war frontiers, challenging the communist East German state\u2019s legitimacy.\n\nBefore our times, physical maps published with explanatory texts often betrayed their creators\u2019 assumptions. An 18th-century Japanese map of the world observed of Brazil: \u201cThe inhabitants of this country do not build houses\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009They like to eat human flesh;\u00a0however, they only eat men and not women. Their clothes are made from birds\u2019 feathers.\u201d\n\nIn western countries, our mental picture of the globe remains profoundly influenced by a 1569 map produced by Gerardus Mercator, a Flemish cartographer. In his effort to depict the three-dimensional Earth on a two-dimensional map, Mercator made places far from the equator look relatively larger. This is why Greenland appears about the same size as Africa, though it is not even a tenth as big.\n\nCome to think of it, could Denmark avoid ceding Greenland to the US, as Trump wants, by using maps to flatter his ego? A US-friendly government in Warsaw once proposed naming a Polish military base after the president. That brainwave came to nothing \u2014 meaning the name is free for use. Perhaps Greenland\u2019s capital, Nuuk, known until 1979 as Godth\u00e5b, could be renamed Fort Trump.\n\ntony.barber@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/68d3ba97-18d2-4f4c-8d6b-305040b31c5b"}, {"title": "Donald Trump hits Canada, Mexico and China with steep tariffs", "description": "US president fires starting gun on possible trade war with levies of up to 25% on goods imported from trading partners", "author": "Aime Williams", "published_date": "2025-02-01T23:02:13.843Z", "content": "Donald Trump hit Canada, Mexico and China with steep tariffs on Saturday in a move that threatens to launch a new era of trade wars between the US and three of its largest trading partners.\n\nTrump issued an executive order applying additional tariffs of 25 per cent to all imports from Canada and Mexico, with the exception of Canadian oil and energy products, which will face a 10 per cent levy. Canada is by far the biggest foreign oil supplier to the US, accounting for about 60 per cent of its crude imports.\n\nA White House official said lower tariffs for Canadian energy aimed to minimise the \u201cdisruptive effects\u201d on US petrol and home heating costs, but confirmed there would be no further exclusions.\n\nImports from China will face a 10 per cent tariff, over and above the existing US tariffs.\n\nThe White House said the tariffs would apply from Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis is a beautiful, beautiful example of promises made, promises kept by President Trump,\u201d a White House official said.\n\nThe official said each order contained \u201ca retaliation clause\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. so that if any country chooses to retaliate in any way, the signal will be to take further action with respect to likely increased tariffs.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate response from America\u2019s trading partners, although Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was expected to announce retaliatory tariffs later tonight.\n\nThe president used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, an executive authority that allows him to respond to emergencies through economic means, to apply the levies without needing congressional approval.\n\nTrump\u2019s abrupt opening move will dash the hopes of countries that expected a slower and more cautious approach to trade policy after the Trump administration ordered a raft of reviews into US commercial relationships on inauguration day.\n\nIt also signals the president\u2019s willingness to use tariffs to apply pressure to allies on issues ranging from immigration to drug trafficking. Trump has justified the tariffs by complaining about what he says is lax security at the borders with Mexico and Canada, and arguing that both \u2014 along with China \u2014 have failed to do enough to stem the flow of deadly opioids into the US.\n\nOn Saturday, a White House official said the tariffs would be lifted as soon as \u201cAmericans stop dying from Made in China, distributed by Mexico and Canada fentanyl\u201d.\n\nThe official added: \u201cThis is not just about fentanyl\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. this is really a border security issue.\u201d\n\nIn a question-and-answer session with reporters on Friday afternoon, Trump also pointed to the America\u2019s trade deficit with Canada, Mexico and China, describing his tariffs as purely economic and denying that they were a negotiating tool.\n\nTrump also acknowledged that sweeping tariffs against US trading partners may cause some \u201cdisruption\u201d, but added: \u201cThe tariffs are going to make us very rich, and very strong.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Trump said he planned to levy tariffs on EU imports too, but Saturday\u2019s announcement did not include any measures relating to the EU.\n\nTrump held back from imposing the 60 per cent tariff on Chinese imports from\u00a0China that he had threatened during the presidential campaign. The 10 per cent levy was designed to punish Beijing over the flow of ingredients to make fentanyl, a deadly opiate that has been the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45 over the past three years.\n\nBeijing cracked down on the export of fentanyl several years ago, but groups in China switched to exporting precursor chemicals to cartels in Mexico to produce the final product.\n\nDimitry Anastakis, a professor of business at the University of Toronto, said the US tariffs\u00a0could be a shock to the system as painful as the Covid pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt is unnecessary and quite stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is taking a sledge hammer to a non-existent problem with the North American economy that was working pretty well.\u201d\n\nAnastakis said there will be immediate pain in the auto trade, job losses and a likely recession in Canada.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ilya Gridneff in Toronto and Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b9101226-edc1-4cde-93ec-186bc95021d7"}, {"title": "\u2018A trade war on steroids\u2019: Trump ushers in new era of US protectionism", "description": "President bets he can achieve his aims through tariffs without igniting inflation or a sell-off in American stocks", "author": "James Politi", "published_date": "2025-02-01T22:17:03.354Z", "content": "Donald Trump has long declared himself a \u201ctariff man\u201d willing to impose sweeping levies on imports from countries that have hurt America.\n\nBut on Saturday, the 78-year old US president took the first dramatic step of his second term towards putting that vision into practice \u2014 placing trade wars and economic nationalism at the top of his agenda.\n\nFrom his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump unleashed aggressive new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, a day after threatening the EU with high levies.\n\nTrump is gambling that he can pressure US trading partners to comply with Washington\u2019s wishes without triggering another damaging acceleration of inflation, at a time when the cost of living remains the top concern of many Americans.\n\nFor the world, Trump\u2019s opening gambit on trade means a series of countries will be forced into bruising negotiations over everything from trade deficits and currency policy to immigration and even America\u2019s new desire for territorial expansion. Financial markets could be shaken and the global economy may suffer.\n\n\u201cThese tariffs herald a new era of US trade protectionism that will affect all American trading partners, whether rivals or allies, and will significantly disrupt international commerce,\u201d says Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University.\n\nThe hardest-hit economies will be Mexico and Canada given their heavy reliance on the US economy, with both facing outright recessions if Trump maintains the 25 per cent tariffs, economists said. The damage will be compounded by the fact that less than six years ago, those countries signed a new trade agreement with Trump in the hope that it would stabilise relations with the US.\n\n\u201cThere are no safe havens,\u201d says Brad Setser, a former US Treasury official now at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cTwo countries that struck the biggest trade deal with Donald Trump in his first term are the first two to get hit with tariffs.\u201d\n\nNeil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, said the macroeconomic effects would depend on how comprehensive the US tariff package was, and how quickly it gets imposed.Some of the impact could be mitigated by appreciation of the dollar and substitution of domestically produced US goods, while corporations may choose to absorb some of the increase in costs via lower profit margins, economists said. But the magnitude of Trump\u2019s first steps \u2014 if fully implemented \u2014 appeared far greater than the more limited trade wars against China and G7 allies during his last time in office.\n\n\u201cThis could be a trade war on steroids,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cThe first round was more targeted. Now they seem to be going across the board \u2014 and faster than I expected,\u201d he added.\n\nEverett Eissenstat, a former Trump economic adviser now at Squire Patton Boggs, said: \u201cI expected the tariffs to go in in a more measured manner. But we can say there is one direction here, and that is that it seems to be escalating.\u201d\n\nThe first tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China may only be the beginning. Trump officials have been considering imposing universal tariffs on all imports, and adding to the levies he imposed on Saturday.\n\nTrump now wants to use tariffs to generate revenue to pay for the extension of trillions of dollars of tax cuts, which can only be achieved through carefully calibrated but hefty levies that could be hard to reverse.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to raising revenue, if the tariff is too low it won\u2019t raise enough money, if it\u2019s too high it will stop trade and then you won\u2019t make any money. They will need to find the sweet spot\u201d, says Bill Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nAs Trump doubles down on tariffs, he faces little resistance from business groups and free-market Republicans who have traditionally balked at his populist policies and sought to rein him in. Jim Risch, the Idaho senator who chairs the Senate foreign relations committee, cheered his latest moves.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has always been very clear that if he sees Americans being taken advantage of, he won\u2019t put up with it,\u201d he said. Referring to Canada, Mexico, and China, he added: \u201cThese governments know very well that they need to stem the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants into our country. The sooner they do that, the better.\u201d\n\nBut there are two big dangers for Trump. One would be a sell-off that sends equity markets and the value of Americans\u2019 retirement plans plunging. The other would be that inflation picks up again after gradually falling towards its 2 per cent target over the past two and a half years.\n\nShearing said that Trump\u2019s proposed measures could push headline PCE inflation above 3 per cent, compared with 2.6 per cent now. Hefty levies on the EU and China would push US price growth even higher, he warned.\u201cThat is a big hit, especially for working families including people who voted for Trump on the rationale that he would reduce prices,\u201d said James Knightley, chief international economist in the US at ING.\u201cThe risks are we see some real pain for the household sector coming through later this year, especially if he expands tariffs on Europe.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, who have been looking for ways to attack Trump early in his second term, have already pounced on the potential for higher inflation.\n\n\u201cSlapping huge tariffs on gas, groceries, phones, TVs and cars means working American families are going to pay more for the things they need,\u201d said Ron Wyden, the Oregon senator, on Friday.\n\n\u201cThese tariffs only make sense as class warfare, forcing typical Americans to foot the bill for another round of tax breaks for Trump and his rich buddies.\u201d\n\nTrump has found comfort in the fact that inflation remained subdued during the trade wars of his first term.\n\nBut Jay Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, noted last week that conditions had changed compared with the structurally low-inflation environment before the pandemic. \u201cYou\u2019re coming through a situation where we\u2019re not quite back to 2 per cent and that\u2019s just different,\u201d he said. For the global economy, one potentially bleak scenario would be that of \u201cmassive supply shock\u201d, said Knightley, similar to the shocks economies weathered during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThe risk is that this is going to be quite damaging, especially if we see a significant response. And I don\u2019t see how politicians don\u2019t respond.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/32bedf88-cf5d-494e-ae45-4f94a3cec6f9"}, {"title": "Donald Trump\u2019s China claims roil Panama as Marco Rubio visits", "description": "Central American nation in \u2018panic\u2019 as US president issues threats over canal", "author": "Stefania Palma", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.798Z", "content": "Panama traded on a reputation as a solid US ally and thriving hub for global business \u2014 until US President Donald Trump took office demanding the return of the shipping canal built by the Americans more than a century ago.\n\nNow the Central American nation, whose cultural links with the US include a passion for baseball, is reeling at its portrayal in Washington as a corrupt rogue state in cahoots with Iran and China that seeks to rip off the US at every turn.\n\nCaught in a fierce geopolitical battle, Panama\u2019s predicament offers a taste of what could happen to other nations that have profited from globalisation and hoped to stay neutral, if they fall foul of Washington\u2019s anti-China mood.\n\nUS secretary of state Marco Rubio claimed to a US radio station this week that China could potentially \u201cshut down the Panama Canal\u201d in any conflict. Ahead of a trip to Panama this weekend, he added: \u201cAnd in fact, I have zero doubt that they have contingency planning to do so. That is a direct threat.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed in a social media post on Christmas Day that the \u201cwonderful soldiers of China\u201d were \u201clovingly but illegally operating the Panama Canal\u201d and has pledged to take back the waterway, using force if necessary. He has since repeated that threat, including in a post-inauguration speech.\n\nPanama\u2019s conservative pro-business president, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, has described the claims of Chinese military control as \u201cnonsense\u201d, insisted the waterway \u201cis and always will be Panama\u2019s\u201d and signalled a willingness to engage in dialogue \u2014 but nobody in Washington appears to be listening.\n\n\u201cEven as it takes advantage of the global maritime system, Panama has emerged as a bad actor,\u201d Republican senator Ted Cruz said as he opened a committee hearing on the Panama Canal this week. \u201cPanama has for years flagged dozens of vessels in the Iranian \u2018ghost fleet\u2019, which brought Iran tens of billions of dollars in oil profits to fund terror across the world.\u201d\n\nPanama\u2019s government and business elite are beginning to panic, diplomats said, as they realise that although Trump\u2019s rhetoric may be flamboyant, the US president and his allies are serious about pressing their tiny country to make concessions and reduce China\u2019s presence \u2014 even if it means tearing up legally binding agreements.\n\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d one envoy said of Mulino\u2019s government. \u201cThey have been holding nonstop meetings trying to work out what Trump really wants.\u201d\n\nComplicating Panama\u2019s efforts to counter Trump\u2019s accusations is the country\u2019s poor record on corruption and its growing embrace of China after it broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 2017 in order to establish relations with Beijing. It also joined the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\n\nWhen attacking Chinese influence, US critics of Panama have focused on two ports at either end of the canal which are run by Hutchison Ports, an arm of Hong Kong-listed conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings, under long concessions. They were renewed without a bidding process in 2021 for 25 years.\n\nThe broader group rose to prominence before the UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997; it operates 53 ports in 24 countries including the UK and Germany. The ports in Panama have a nearly 40 per cent market share, and the country launched an audit of the licences after Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nAlso in Panama, Chinese state-controlled companies have built a huge convention centre close to the mouth of the canal and are constructing a new bridge over the waterway and a cruise ship port, contracts that were secured through bidding processes. Beijing was seeking to build a big new embassy on land near the canal until US objections killed the scheme.\n\nPanama also planned to negotiate a free trade deal with China this year, though its status is now unclear.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing a divided Washington agrees on, it\u2019s that we\u2019re anti-China,\u201d said a former Trump administration official. \u201cWhat Trump is really saying is that China exerts an undue influence on the canal through operating ports at both ends, and that\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nChina has insisted Panama\u2019s independence is \u201cnot negotiable\u201d and the canal \u201cis not under direct or indirect control by any power\u201d. \u201cWe respect Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and recognise it as a permanently neutral international waterway,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said this month.\n\nAs for Cruz\u2019s Iran accusations, Panama\u2019s maritime authority in 2023 cancelled the registration of 136 Panamanian-flagged vessels after finding they had a \u201cdirect link\u201d to Iran\u2019s national oil company.\n\nTransparency International ranks Panama 108th in the world in its most recent Corruption Perceptions Index, equal with Sierra Leone, and its score has deteriorated recently.\n\nPanamanian officials insist their country has cleaned up its act in recent years, but it spent many years on international blacklists for money laundering and was the centre of the 2016 \u201cPanama Papers\u201d scandal, when a huge data leak from a Panamanian law firm exposed billions of dollars of offshore assets hidden from tax and law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re dealing with is really systematic historic corruption that nobody\u2019s really called out,\u201d Louis Sola, the Trump-appointed chair of the US Federal Maritime Commission, told the Financial Times.\n\nReferring to Tuesday\u2019s senate hearing on Panama, he said: \u201cWe identified very clearly that there\u2019s some sweetheart deals going on\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009As a competition regulator, we have to look at that.\u201d\n\nMulino was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former president Ricardo Martinelli, a billionaire who tapped him as a candidate after he was barred from running again in last year\u2019s election following a money-laundering conviction. Martinelli is sheltering under diplomatic protection in the Nicaraguan embassy in Panama.\n\nTrump\u2019s business has had its own vexed encounter with Panama: the Trump Organization managed a hotel in the country but the arrangement acrimoniously collapsed in 2018, amid a legal dispute, when the owners evicted his company from the building.\n\nUncomfortable in the spotlight and unaccustomed to running campaigns to win hearts and minds in Washington, Panama is not trying to fight a media battle with the US president.\n\nGovernment ministers have been instructed to stay tight-lipped and Mulino\u2019s comments have been limited to saying there will be no negotiation about the ownership of the canal.\n\nInstead, myriad small Panamanian flags have been fixed to posts on major roads in the capital and on some pavements and buildings ahead of Rubio\u2019s visit, in a quiet but determined show of nationalism.\n\n\u201cI think we have made a mistake in thinking that it doesn\u2019t matter what [the Americans] say,\u201d said Tony Fletcher, an executive and former head of Panama\u2019s business lobby Conep who formerly worked at US group Gillette.*\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time to start to set the record straight. We have to do it in writing, with publications, and above all because in this war of disinformation what needs to prevail is well-sourced information.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhy would I be looking at Iran and other countries?

A ferocious US tech sell-off spread to energy stocks and utilities that had been expected to benefit from demand for power to fuel AI data centres.\n\nBut since then, the sell-off has run out of steam. US indices ended the week lower, with Nvidia close to its Monday lows. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 1 per cent and 1.6 per cent over the past five sessions.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek isn\u2019t devastating for the overall market.

Last year the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks were responsible for more than half of the S&P 500\u2019s gain.\n\nHowever, bears fear that DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough could have huge implications for the spending plans and valuations of some of the Silicon Valley giants that have driven that rally, and for the wider, top-heavy US market, where the largest 10 stocks now account for almost two-fifths of the S&P 500.\n\nDeepSeek \u201ctells us there is growing competition and AI may be harder to monetise than assumed\u201d, said\u00a0Robert Almeida, global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management.\n\nHe thinks the Chinese firm represents the start of a new capital cycle, creating \u201cgrowing supply, growing competition, and lower returns\u201d that may threaten the high valuations of the big AI incumbents.\n\nBillionaire investor Ray Dalio told the Financial Times this week that AI hype had fuelled a \u201cbubble\u201d in US equities.\n\nBeyond Nvidia, big losers this week have been chipmaker Broadcom and energy groups GE Vernova and Constellation Energy.\n\nBut many investors and analysts think the sell-off was a blip rather than the start of a fundamental market shift.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [we\u2019re in] a bubble and I don\u2019t think we are about to see a bubble burst,\u201d said Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief global equity strategist.\u00a0Instead, DeepSeek was simply a reminder that the \u201cdominant tech companies are not immune from disruption and competition\u201d.\n\nInvestor appetite for US tech companies appeared undimmed on Thursday, when shares in Tesla and Meta rose after the two companies pledged to pour billions more dollars into building out their AI infrastructure.\n\nSome think DeepSeek\u2019s cheap alternative to OpenAI\u2019s popular ChatGPT app could in fact spur even higher AI spending in the US. Bank analysts\u2019 notes last week talked of the so-called Jevons paradox \u2014 the theory that demand for technology such as AI will surge as it becomes cheaper and more energy efficient, leading to an overall increase in energy use.\n\n\u201cEverybody is [too] negative. [DeepSeek] is not going to change the underlying demand for computing capacity,\u201d said Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at Nvidia shareholder J Stern & Co, citing massive spending commitments made by groups such as Meta.\n\nHe does not believe Nvidia is overvalued, and thinks that rising profits will support the stock price of some Big Tech firms. \u201cYou may not have an increase in the valuation but you will benefit from the growth in earnings, in revenues and in cash flows.\u201d\n\nVenture capitalist Reid Hoffman, billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn and ManasAI, sees DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough as bullish for the wider AI sector.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek isn\u2019t a game-changer for global AI hegemony, but it is a welcome wake-up call that China\u2019s competitive talent is very capable,\u201d he told the FT.\n\n\u201cMany small AI companies in the US use large models to train their smaller models more efficiently. So a quality model like DeepSeek trained using that tactic is a positive signal for what small AI companies in the US can build,\u201d he added.\n\nSome even think this week\u2019s market turmoil could spark a healthy rebalancing for the wider market.\n\nMarko Kolanovic, JPMorgan\u2019s former chief global markets strategist \u2014 who has long warned of the risks to market stability from investors piling into the same handful of stocks and trades \u2014 said Nvidia\u2019s 17 per cent decline on Monday should provide the market with a \u201cshot in the arm\u201d.The past week\u2019s sell-off may trigger a rotation within the tech sector into relative \u201claggards\u201d like Apple, he said. \u201cMaybe [Nvidia] isn\u2019t such a sure bet after all.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Mari Novik and Harriet Agnew in London", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/265ac5a6-531f-4647-be62-8b9c3d74ca54"}, {"title": "Facebook parent Meta in talks to reincorporate outside Delaware  ", "description": "Group is latest tech company to consider move away from longtime American corporate haven ", "author": "Hannah Murphy", "published_date": "2025-01-31T22:21:46.997Z", "content": "Meta is in discussions to reincorporate outside of Delaware, becoming the latest tech group to study exiting the state that has long been considered an American corporate haven.\n\nThe social media group is weighing moving its legal residence to another state, such as Texas, but has not decided on a destination, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe talks come after Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg earlier this month announced the company would move its US-based trust and safety staff from California to Texas as part of a broad \u2018free speech\u2019 overhaul of its approach to content moderation.\n\nZuckerberg said at the time the shift would help the company \u201cbuild trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams\u201d.\n\nMeta has faced allegations from President Donald Trump and his allies that it censors conservatives and is staffed by liberal-leaning employees, but has recently been attempting to court the new administration.\n\nMeta declined to comment on a possible relocation. However, the group said there was no plan to move its corporate headquarters out of California. The Wall Street Journal first reported on its potential reincorporation.\n\nLast year, Elon Musk won shareholder backing to reincorporate electric-vehicle maker Tesla to Texas, leaving Delaware after a dispute over a lawsuit seeking to block his huge pay package, which has been twice repudiated by the state\u2019s corporate law court.\n\nMusk, the world\u2019s richest man, also reincorporated his social platform X from Delaware to Texas.\n\nDelaware has struggled adjudicating disputes with companies with dominant shareholders or dual-class shares. The state\u2019s corporate law imposes higher legal review standards on these so-called controlled companies.\n\nMeta had faced several fiduciary breach lawsuits in Delaware from minority shareholders including against a share reclassification that would have handed more voting power to Zuckerberg, a move the company abandoned in 2017 prior to a trial.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the S&P 500 is incorporated in Delaware and many venture capital investors demand start-ups make their legal domicile there.\n\nCorporate law observers believed investor protections in the state would force management teams to remain in Delaware. But a large company such as Meta leaving could become a bellwether for further migration.\n\nSeparately on Friday, Dropbox, a cloud storage provider, said its shareholders approved a reincorporation to Nevada from Delaware.

Days later, the Fiat and Jeep owner announced $5bn investment in the US; in December, after Trump\u2019s election, the group had reversed a decision to cut 1,100 jobs at a Jeep plant in Ohio.\n\nOne European banker said: \u201cAnyone under-represented in the US or over-represented in Europe\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009would want to make sure they are building the next plant there versus here.\u201d\n\nA rush by companies to expand in the US to defend against tariffs and benefit from potentially less onerous regulation and a strong economy under Trump would follow an earlier surge in investment under his predecessor Joe Biden.\n\nThe Biden administration handed $370bn in loans, subsidies and other support to companies under his flagship Inflation Reduction Act, though Trump has moved to scrap some of the handouts.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ian Johnston in Paris and Ivan Levingston in London", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0d1f9066-e82d-40e8-83e4-614f99df93c8"}, {"title": "Chevron seeks to protect Venezuelan business scrutinised by White House  ", "description": "Chief warns country could be vulnerable to Chinese and Russian influence if it is forced to abandon operations there ", "author": "Jamie Smyth", "published_date": "2025-01-31T20:20:14.256Z", "content": "Chevron is seeking to protect a special US licence allowing it to operate in Venezuela, saying China and Russia will gain influence in the oil-producing nation \u2014 and the western hemisphere \u2014 if it is forced out by Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, Chevron\u2019s chief executive Mike Wirth said the company would engage with the White House after Marco Rubio, US secretary of state, said the licence should be reconsidered.\n\nWirth said Chevron would operate in compliance with US law and \u201cstayed out of the politics\u201d but added that if the US oil major exited it would allow rival nations\u2019 state oil companies to expand in the Latin American country.\n\n\u201cIn Venezuela, in particular, what you have seen when countries from the west leave, you\u2019ve seen companies from China, from Russia, increase their presence as a result,\u201d he said.\n\nWirth said third-party studies suggested Venezuela\u2019s economy would suffer if Chevron exited and could drive migration flows into the US. He made his comments shortly before Trump sent his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, to Venezuela on Friday to discuss a deal for the repatriation of the country\u2019s deportees from the US.\n\nChevron has operated in Venezuela for nearly a century, and its licenses to do so have been extended several times \u2014 including by the first Trump administration \u2014 even as the US has grown increasingly impatient with successive authoritarian regimes in Caracas and imposed economic sanctions to punish its leadership.\n\nIn 2022 Joe Biden\u2019s administration granted a licence authorising Chevron to expand its Venezuelan business, in a show of good faith and hope of improving democratic conditions under authoritarian President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Broad sanctions on the country\u2019s oil sector were lifted in October 2023, allowing companies to do business with PDVSA, Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil producer.\n\nBut Maduro backtracked on a promise to allow the opposition to pick its own candidate in the presidential election last July, and the outcome, in which Maduro was declared the winner in a result widely regarded as fraudulent, have prompted critics on both sides of the political aisle to question whether western companies should still continue doing business there.\n\nThe sanctions were reimposed last April, though individual exemption licences, including Chevron\u2019s, were kept in place.\n\nThat licence has enabled Chevron to boost its Venezuelan production to about 200,000 barrels a day.\n\nChevron, the second-biggest western oil company, had net income of $3.2bn in the fourth quarter compared with $2.2bn a year earlier, but adjusted earnings of $2.06 a share were below Wall Street estimates of $2.11. Its shares fell 4.6 per cent on Friday in New York.\n\nThe group, which was a significant donor to Republican candidates in the recent election cycle, according to Open Secrets, used the phrase \u201cGulf of America\u201d in its earnings material instead of Gulf of Mexico, just days after Trump called for the renaming of the body of water.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s opposition, led by Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, has increased calls to cancel Chevron\u2019s licence.\n\nSpeaking to the FT this month, Machado \u2014 who was banned from running in the election \u2014 warned Chevron and other foreign companies against \u201chelping to prop up\u201d Maduro\u2019s government.\n\nRubio has signalled a tougher approach to the country. At his confirmation hearing this month, he told senators the Biden administration \u201cgot played\u201d by Maduro.\n\nRubio said: \u201cNow they have these general licenses where companies like Chevron are actually providing billions of dollars of money into the regime\u2019s coffers, and the regime kept none of the promises that they made. So all that needs to be re-explored.\u201d\n\nWhen Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term this month, the outgoing Biden administration, alongside the EU and the UK, announced co-ordinated sanctions on Venezuelan officials, though it stopped short of cancelling the exemption licences.\n\nSome experts play down concerns that Chinese and Russian rivals could fill any gap left by Chevron.\n\nFrancisco Monaldi, a Latin America energy expert at Rice University in Houston, said Chinese and Russian oil companies are unlikely to make a move in Venezuela should Chevron leave.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t done it during the past few years, and particularly since US sanctions have been in place, they have been very cautious,\u201d Monaldi said.\n\nWirth said Chevron was owed a significant amount of money in Venezuela. \u201cLook, we\u2019re running a business.

In recent years, the entrepreneur Elon Musk has become (in)famous for being so maniacally focused on overhauling entities such as Tesla and X that he has slept in offices and fired employees he considered uncommitted.\n\nNow he wants to do the same at Donald Trump\u2019s White House. This week, 2mn federal employees were asked to resign if they did not want to come into the office (and, by implication, embrace the reforms Musk is hatching at the new Department of Government Efficiency he leads).\n\nThe White House apparently expects 5-10 per cent of staff to take the offer, saving $100bn annually. And to reinforce the message, Musk even dispatched the same \u201cFork-in-the-road\u201d meme used when he fired staff at X. He is reportedly sleeping in the Executive Office of the President, too.\n\nUnions will undoubtedly howl. So will progressives. And Musk\u2019s plans will probably face legal challenges. But even as many observers recoil, quite understandably, from Musk\u2019s brutal style, there is one point that no one should ignore: if Doge can actually unleash digital reform in the US government, and in a non-corrupt manner, that would be an unambiguously good thing.\n\nIndeed, if I had a Musk-focused magic wand, I would wish him to make digital reform, not trolling his critics, Doge\u2019s main priority. Digitising government is not just the key to creating greater efficiency and effectiveness; it could also restore some of the public\u2019s shattered trust in the state.\n\nThe reason for this is that America is bedevilled by a paradox. On the one hand, its private sector is extraordinarily dynamic, and driving much of the 21st-century tech revolution, with its laser-like focus on consumers. But on the other, its government bureaucracy is sclerotic and inefficient, with an antediluvian approach to technology.\n\nSo much so, in fact, that the US does not even feature in the UN\u2019s 2024 list of the 18 most tech-savvy e-governments, ranking well behind countries such as Estonia, Singapore and Denmark, and even Saudi Arabia. That is shocking.\n\nPrevious administrations have tried to change this. In 2014, Barack Obama created the United States Digital Service, in a bid to improve government tech after the botched rollout of his HealthCare.gov initiative. This has had some success. As Deloitte notes, the Inland Revenue Service introduced an automated paper returns-scanning process during the Covid pandemic which enabled it to scan \u201c80 times more returns in the first quarter of 2023 than the whole of 2022\u201d. And during Trump\u2019s first administration, his son-in-law Jared Kushner tried to overhaul electronic record-keeping at the Department of Veterans Affairs (a laudable move that, sadly, had patchy results).\n\nBut reformers have faced big obstacles. One is a government culture of risk aversion, says Brett Goldstein of Vanderbilt University, who previously oversaw the Defense Digital Service at the Pentagon. Another is that federal structures are fragmented and plagued by outdated tech.\n\n\u201cThere are 101 civilian agencies\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and back in 2017 we were spending $60bn a year on [those] and half was on legacy systems,\u201d laments Chris Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the first Trump administration. \u201cNow it is certainly more.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge, outlined in a recent book by Jennifer Pahlka, a Democrat who has fought for tech reform, is that the government typically plans projects in a slow-moving, top-down manner \u2014 unlike the private sector, which uses an iterative, bottom-up, user-focused approach. The consequence is \u201cconcrete boat[s]\u201d, she notes. In other words, projects so heavy they sink.\n\nCan Musk change this? Many techies hope so. \u201cI think Elon is the right person for the job since he has a bottom-up approach and the energy and tenacity to go into the details,\u201d says Goldstein. Or, as Krebs, puts it: \u201cWhat is happening now is much bigger and more intentional than [what we did before].\u201d\n\nAnd there is widespread consensus on what should be done: install a \u201csoftware as a service\u201d mentality into government that focuses on user needs, with a centralised \u201cshare services\u201d model. That could create a co-ordinated procurement process that would slash costs, create a better experience for citizens and improve cyber defence.\n\nMoreover, case studies show how to do this. Canada adopted a shared service approach more than a decade ago, notes Krebs. Estonia, Denmark and Singapore are also good models. And Ukraine offers a particularly inspirational example of how to build apps that provide government services to citizens.\n\nSo will Musk ever succeed in inculcating these non-American lessons? Does he have the tenacity, force and staff for a lengthy cultural fight? We don\u2019t know.\n\nBut one thing, at least, is clear: if Musk does manage to import approaches from places such as Estonia or Singapore \u2014 and in the process create a functioning e-government in the US \u2014 he will deserve praise from Republicans and Democrats alike. So, please, Elon: focus on that, not political posturing. Future generations of Americans will thank you.\n\ngillian.tett@ft.com", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f9754b26-25fc-4403-8d42-3b12e82cd20f"}, {"title": "Wise ordered to pay $2.5mn in US for misleading fee advertising", "description": "London-listed fintech handed penalty by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for \u2018series of illegal actions\u2019 ", "author": "Akila Quinio", "published_date": "2025-01-31T09:37:43.242Z", "content": "London-listed fintech Wise has been ordered to pay nearly $2.5mn by US regulators for \u201ca series of illegal actions\u201d including misleading advertising of its fees.\n\nThe US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday demanded Wise pay a $2mn civil penalty and $450,000 in customer compensation for advertising inaccurate fees and failing to properly disclose exchange rates and other costs.\n\nWise prides itself on offering cheap and quick cross-border payments, without hidden costs.

Katie, dressed in an ivory white Stella McCartney suit, and James, in Paul Smith, are two peas in a pod: thoughtful, big-picture thinkers, nimble with quips. As James weighs up the highs and lows of 2024, Katie chips in: \u201cNot spending enough time with me!\u201d\n\nIndeed, each spends an average of 40 weeks a year away from the UK, with Katie competing on the global WTA circuit, and James in LA for awards season from January\u00a0to April, and then on the road to work with clients across the globe \u2013 his roster includes Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas, Jessica Alba, Cardi\u00a0B, Paris Hilton, Patrick Dempsey, Catherine Zeta Jones, Cynthia Erivo and Karlie Kloss. Over his career,\u00a0James has been responsible for securing over $200mn of commercial and\u00a0endorsement opportunities for his clients, and expanding their commercial ventures by securing brand partnerships, negotiating equity deals, licensing and launching new ventures.\n\n\u201cKatie and I are both the products of the people that are around us and the support that we have. The support that I provide to my clients is very much the same. I\u2019m a part of their mechanism,\u201d says James. While his sister is in front of the camera, he works discreetly behind the scenes. \u201cMy highs are attached to my clients\u2019, such as landing a major film role or releasing a new album that performs incredibly well,\u201d he says. It often means \u201cadvising and supporting them on crafting strategy and carefully preparing for the next step\u201d.\n\nLast year was a standout for Katie, who won a prestigious title at the San Diego Open and another one in Nottingham (she also won her first title there in 2023). \u201c2024 has been a lot of what I dreamt about when I wanted to become a tennis player. I wanted to achieve multiple things. One of them was to get my ranking inside the top 50 and then see how far I could go with my potential. I always felt I had it, but I never managed to fully capitalise on it. A lot of people spend their whole career trying to get one title so, for me,\u00a0two titles [in one year] was a massive achievement.\u201d Her next priority is to do well at the Slams \u2013 so far her\u00a0best\u00a0performances have been third rounds at Wimbledon and the US Open in 2023.\n\nShe puts part of her success down to life-work balance, the support of her team, her fianc\u00e9 Alex de Minaur (the Australian-born world No 18 player), family and her new fitness trainer, Matt Little. \u201cMy team pushes me through the tough moments and the good moments. They keep me motivated. It\u2019s never-ending tennis,\u201d she says.\u00a0 The player is appreciated by fans for her generous, smiley\u00a0demeanour on and off the court. She and de Minaur are often seen at each other\u2019s games, cheering each other on. Most days, though, are intense: the training involves two to three hours of practice, plus two gym sessions and recovery time in physio and cryo bath. Downtime is spent exploring the cities they land in. For James, the most important thing is a rest from phone calls and emails. He restores his vintage cars and regularly plays tennis. \u201cIt is great for clearing the mind,\u201d he asserts. \u201cWhat a terrible idea!\u201d jokes Katie.\n\nThe siblings\u2019 discipline and focus was instilled as children growing up in Leicestershire, in a family that rewarded both play and work. Tennis is in the blood. Their mother Susan, a teacher and tennis coach, played the game at county level, as did their maternal grandmother Gill Gartshore, while the siblings\u2019 businessman father David encouraged the duo to go for it and persevere. James was Katie\u2019s main tennis partner and they played regularly at the local court. \u201cHow many times did James get into a bad mood and storm off the court? I can tell you a few times!\u201d laughs Katie, who was driven by the simple challenge of\u00a0beating her older brother. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much how I landed in tennis.\u201d James also followed the family tradition for a time, making it to county level for Leicestershire. \u201cMy mum or grandpa would often take us both to tournaments at the weekends around the country\u2026 however, as Katie would come back with trophy after trophy, it became clear she had something special, and by the age of eight she\u00a0was already representing Great Britain,\u201d he says.\n\nJames\u2019s journey into the entertainment field was circuitous. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody, especially in the UK, tells you that you could be a Hollywood agent. It doesn\u2019t come up in career counselling,\u201d he says. He left school at 18 and first started a packaged-goods health-food business, before moving into\u00a0management consultancy, overseeing brands and interacting with talent. He then took that knowledge into the entertainment world, setting up his own agency in London in 2019. Indian actress and producer Priyanka Chopra Jonas was one of his first signings, entrusted to him by her manager Anjula Acharia.\n\n\u201cI was representing a small set of talent and building their businesses across anything that\u2019s commercial \u2013endorsements, joint ventures, equity deals \u2013 the full scope of anything that is outside of their role as either an actor or musician,\u201d he explains. It led to James joining UTA, one of the largest talent agencies in the world, spearheaded by his mentors, co-head of talent Chris Hart\u00a0and CEO Jeremy Zimmer.\n\nJames and Katie\u2019s professional worlds are aligned and intertwined. Tennis is ever more popular, particularly women\u2019s tennis,\u00a0while sport and fashion are increasingly converging. Katie benefits from hefty sponsorship deals with brands including Nike, Pragnell fine jewellery, Wilson and Lexus, while James masterminds such deals for his clients. He does not represent Katie, with both preferring to preserve their\u00a0sister-brother relationship over business. \u201cThere is a greater convergence between each of those worlds,\u201d he agrees. \u201cThe responsibility is often greater now too:\u00a0talent is global by nature and has to operate and resonate in different territories and still be authentic. We live in an attention economy\u00a0driven by new platforms.\u201d\n\nHe cites a single post by Chopra Jonas for HSBC about the challenges of moving abroad as a southern Asian. \u201cThat one post was watched by around 668 million people, which is over five times the Super Bowl audience, so\u00a0the responsibility to navigate one\u2019s smaller actions, which then inform everything else, is quite huge,\u201d says James. \u201cYour reach across all platforms must be reaching\u00a0half a million,\u201d he nods at Katie.\n\nThe close dynamic between talent and the social media audience has its own drawbacks. For Katie,\u00a0keeping grounded is fundamental, reminding herself of athletes like Jessica Ennis-Hill that she looked up to as a young girl. \u201cI see myself as someone that kids want to look up to. I think every action that I make and the way that I hold myself on the court and off it is vital, because they always pick up on those little things. When I\u2019m having a tough day and I want to crack a racket or scream at something, I always hold back. Being able to control myself and stay classy on court, it\u2019s so important.\u201d\n\nTheir mode of communication is, week to week, through a family WhatsApp group. \u201cWe are good at sharing each other\u2019s little wins as well as the big ones \u2013 but the big wins are pretty evident,\u201d says James. \u201cFor Katie, that\u2019s her performance at a Grand Slam or winning\u00a0a title and, for me,\u00a0it\u2019s a campaign that gets seen\u00a0by billions of people worldwide. We know what each\u00a0of us are doing, so our family chat is used for smaller\u00a0wins and everything in between \u2013 the good, the\u00a0bad, the ugly,\u201d he smiles.", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/73b2b864-9873-44c4-bdd6-cc36a3b125cc"}, {"title": "Canada warns Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs could leave US reliant on Venezuela\u2019s oil ", "description": "Foreign minister M\u00e9lanie Joly holds meetings in Washington in attempt to avert trade war", "author": "Aime Williams", "published_date": "2025-01-31T05:01:44.233Z", "content": "The US would be forced to buy oil from geopolitical rivals such as Venezuela if it disrupted trade with Canada, Ottawa\u2019s foreign minister has warned.\n\nM\u00e9lanie Joly told the Financial Times the US president\u2019s threat to impose levies of 25 per cent on Canadian imports would hit \u201creal people\u201d if relations between the two countries descended into a trade war.\n\n\u201cWe ship oil at a discount which is, ultimately, refined in Texas.

According to an economic pattern identified by the historian Niall Ferguson, hegemonic powers that spent more on interest than on the military in the past entered a period of geopolitical decline. Is this now the fate of the US?\n\nThe current disarray of American public finances makes us imagine the previously unimaginable: the issuer of the world\u2019s foremost reserve currency being overburdened by public debt. This debt is on track to surpass 160 per cent of GDP by mid-century, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. In the next 10 years, State Street says $2tn annually of net issuance of Treasury debt is expected. Unlike in the 2010s, the Federal Reserve and other price-insensitive buyers, such as foreign central banks, may not be net buyers. Some European sovereigns look similarly exposed. Governments seem to perennially believe that their economies are in a bad spot and need propping up through fiscal stimulus.\n\nAs the era of close-to-zero interest rates is fading into history, the debt service burden will inexorably rise. This will come on top of a secular deceleration of the world economy and thus tax receipts; higher public spending on ageing populations; and rising defence outlays. At the same time, political dysfunction is on the rise, rendering fiscal consolidation a remoter prospect.\n\nThankfully, there are institutions that warn investors of rising sovereign risk: the rating agencies. Or are there? It is fair to question whether the big three agencies \u2014 S&P Global, Moody\u2019s and Fitch \u2014 have become more coy about the risks of rich countries. In contrast, the agencies seem more willing to dish out downgrades to emerging and developing economies.\n\nThis ratings bifurcation became glaringly obvious during the Covid-19 pandemic: the agencies downgraded poor countries left, right and centre, but left advanced economies\u2019 ratings unscathed. Fitch has cut credit ratings on the US, France and the UK in recent years. Moody\u2019s and S&P also downgraded France last year. But the trend is more about a divide.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, the Big Three rating changes for rich sovereigns were more negative than for emerging markets. The net change \u2014 upgrades minus downgrades \u2014 of advanced sovereign ratings was about 1 per cent of the rated portfolio per year, compared with an even higher net-upgrade ratio of 8 per cent for emerging markets.\n\nBut between 2015 and 2024, there have been even more upgrades for rich countries (a net balance of about 3 per cent of the portfolio per year), despite what appear to be weakening fundamentals. In sharp contrast, emerging markets saw a net balance of about 4 per cent of their sovereign portfolio downgraded, a huge swing from the buoyant earlier period.\n\nIn the face of deteriorating public finances in Washington during the pandemic and 10 weeks after a violent mob stormed the Capitol. S&P raised its assessment score of the institutional strength of the US on its 1 to 5 range to its top level of 1. This step in effect averted a downgrade\u00a0as its assessment of the US fiscal performance had deteriorated.\n\nThere is no question that many emerging sovereigns\u2019 creditworthiness has taken a hit during the past decade. The net downgrade pattern seems appropriate. But has the forward-looking creditworthiness of the rich world really improved over the same period? That appears far-fetched. What seems more likely is that the agencies have taken fright after lawsuits and regulatory backlashes following the financial and Eurozone debt crisis.\n\nFor example, the S&P \u2014 the first agency to downgrade the US in 2011 \u2014 had been the subject of particular ire from policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic, from a costly Department of Justice lawsuit to criminal prosecution in Italy. Disclosure: I was part of the committee that downgraded the US and I was a defendant in the Italian case in which the agency and my colleagues were acquitted. My time at the S&P ended in 2018.\n\nThe prime role of credit agencies on sovereign debt is to call out credit risk without fear or favour. If not, some investors may be lulled into a false sense of security, which may allow governments to procrastinate and dig themselves into ever-deeper holes. One test might be looming. If US finances deteriorate further, are they prepared to stand up to President Donald Trump and cut ratings?", "tag": "us?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f5ceb7b6-1d9f-444d-bfbb-f5110d737e03"}, {"title": "Grab your popcorn, Masa Son is back", "description": "Plus, carmaker Stellantis bets on a turnaround in Trump\u2019s America and the rising infrastructure star at Blackstone", "author": "Amelia Pollard", "published_date": "2025-01-31T05:00:44.902Z", "content": "One thing to start: McKinsey is considering spinning off its in-house asset manager MIO Partners, which invests the private wealth of the consulting firm\u2019s senior staff and alumni.

DD has missed his often adventurous financial forays.\n\nMasa has been circling the AI craze with relative quiet, but finally he\u2019s within grasp of securing a seat at the table of Silicon Valley\u2019s great investment craze.\n\nSoftBank is in talks to invest as much as $25bn in OpenAI, the darling at the heart of the AI frenzy. The deal would make the Japanese group OpenAI\u2019s biggest financial backer.\n\nThe investment would be part of a bigger funding round of about $40bn at Sam Altman\u2019s company, which would push the ChatGPT-maker\u2019s valuation to $300bn, the FT reported late on Thursday.\n\nMasa\u2019s known for majorly leveraging up his investments (one banker in 2019 said there were \u201clayers of leverage upon leverage\u201d). This cuts two ways: when things turn sideways, they implode. But a good call can lead to massive payouts.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, is Masa buying in at the end of the cycle?\n\nSoftBank\u2019s famous for a few spectacular blow-ups. WeWork\u2019s valuation plummeted after it had to scrap its IPO plan (and then later, filed for bankruptcy). SoftBank\u2019s ties and backing of Greensill Capital also ended in disaster.\n\nSo, for a few years, Masa has kept under the radar, licking his wounds while building up a strong conviction that AI would be the centrepiece of his next great set of investments.\n\nAnd the spigot of massive tech investments has once again opened up, coaxing him to make a big dice roll.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s one of just four investors who have pledged a total of $100bn to fund Stargate, a major new data centre project unveiled last week. (Others backing the project touted by President Donald Trump include Oracle, Abu Dhabi state fund MGX and OpenAI.)\n\nThe ties between OpenAI and SoftBank are multiplying quickly. The new potential $25bn investment would cover the latter\u2019s commitment to the US infrastructure project, according to several people familiar with the plans.\n\nWhen it comes to bets on AI, Masa has had some good luck so far. His investment in Arm \u2014 of which SoftBank\u2019s still the majority shareholder \u2014 has made him a fortune, with the stock trebling since going public.\n\nThis has given him a new stockpile of assets to leverage in every which way to seed his bets. Such firepower has historically become a fount of entertainment for Wall Street, or just good drama.\n\nPlease join DD in pulling up a seat with some popcorn and a stiff drink in hand, because our boy\u2019s officially back.\n\nJust before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, the scion of Italy\u2019s billionaire Agnelli family John Elkann joined a swelling list of high-powered executives to visit the returning US president.\n\nAs ever with Trump, a deal was on the cards. Days later, the Dodge and Jeep maker Stellantis, which Elkann chairs, committed to invest $5bn across its US car factories.\n\nThe move is part of Elkann\u2019s plan to turn around the struggling carmaker, after the company parted ways with charismatic but uncompromising chief executive Carlos Tavares last month.\n\nStellantis\u2019s share price has cratered in the past year as it has struggled with a shortfall in demand for its cars. Tavares\u2019s unrelenting style also damaged relations, not least with US dealers saddled with high-priced vehicles they were unable to shift.\n\nSince Tavares\u2019s departure, Elkann has jetted across Europe to improve relations with the leaders of Italy, France and the EU, cancelled lay-offs in the US and refreshed Stellantis\u2019s management teams.\n\nHis visit to Trump may prove the most important step yet in his strategic reset.\n\nBeyond the $5bn investment, Elkann is betting that he can use Trump\u2019s EV scepticism and deregulation push to Stellantis\u2019s advantage.\n\nHe told Trump he would back the new administration\u2019s shift away from Joe Biden\u2019s EV targets. The carmaker will launch a number of new models in 2025, across hybrid, electric and petrol formats.\n\nWhile Elkann may have won Trump\u2019s favour, there are challenges ahead. The company continues to supply the US from Canada and Mexico, who are both threatened with tariffs.\n\nAnd whoever Elkann chooses as Stellantis\u2019s next chief executive will face the same challenges as the rest of the car industry: increasing competition from China and a long-term slowdown in new car sales.\n\nBlackstone, the world\u2019s largest alternative manager, is flexing its muscles again after enduring a test when interest rates soared in 2022, causing many investors to sell their investments in its massive property fund, Breit.\n\nIt\u2019s on the offensive again after raising $171bn and investing $134bn in 2024, not far off the New York-based group\u2019s activity in 2021 when chief executive Stephen Schwarzman professed an \u201cout of body experience\u201d as cash sloshed around freely.\n\nIn its fourth-quarter results, Blackstone\u2019s relatively nascent infrastructure business emerged as a driver of better than expected returns.\n\nIts $43bn perpetual infrastructure fund soared about 20 per cent for the year, lifting its fee-related performance revenues by $1.2bn, or 728 per cent, from the same time in 2023.\n\nAt the helm of Blackstone\u2019s infrastructure unit is a rising star inside the group who was name-checked by Schwarzman in front of shareholders on Thursday.\n\nIn 2017, Sean Klimczak was tasked with getting Blackstone on the map in infrastructure, an area where non-US groups such as Brookfield, Macquarie and EQT dominate. The efforts didn\u2019t start off swimmingly \u2014 a Saudi Arabia-backed effort initially stalled.\n\nMeanwhile, independent infrastructure investment outfits including Global Infrastructure Partners and Stonepeak, which had been spun out of Blackstone, had their assets soar.\n\nBut Blackstone\u2019s now collected $55bn in infrastructure assets and believes it has positioned itself to be a major player. It has been bolstered by winning investments such as gas export pioneer Cheniere Energy Partners and data centre operator QTS.\n\nSchwarzman said the toils of building businesses internally carry \u201csignificant economic benefits as compared to a strategy of bolt-on acquisitions\u201d, an apparent reference to a wave of infrastructure-related deals such as BlackRock\u2019s $12.5bn takeover of GIP last year.\n\nSpace lasers Donald Trump has ordered work on a defence shield that goes beyond Ronald Reagan\u2019s famed \u201cStar Wars\u201d programme, the FT reports.\n\nDeutsche\u2019s woes For much of the past 15 years, the only thing consistent about Deutsche Bank was its ability to step on every rake it encountered, Lex writes.

The Bombardier CRJ700 jet was making its approach into Washington Reagan National Airport when it collided with a US army Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk helicopter, plunging into the Potomac River.\n\nThe fuselage of the commercial jet was found in three pieces in the water. The American flight had 60 passengers and four crew members on board, while three soldiers were in the Black Hawk.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board said it would have a preliminary report in 30 days. The agency late on Thursday said it had recovered the voice and data recorders from the jet, though the helicopter\u2019s were still in the water.\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s speculation regarding the cause of the crash, Jennifer Homendy, the agency\u2019s chair, earlier on Thursday said: \u201cWe do not know enough facts to be able to rule in or out human factor, mechanical factors.\u201d\n\nTrump, who was flanked by his vice-president and newly sworn-in secretaries of defence and transportation, began his remarks with an appeal for unity in \u201ca moment of anguish\u201d, when \u201cthe differences between Americans fade to nothing\u201d.\n\nBut he quickly launched into a political attack against Democrats, saying that ex-presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had lowered standards for who was allowed to qualify to be an air traffic controller.\n\n\u201cI put safety first, Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and their politics was even worse.\u201d\n\nHe said that \u201cfor an air traffic controller, we want the brightest, the smartest, the sharpest.

It had the ability to go up or down, had the ability to turn, and the turn it made was not the correct one,\u201d he added.\n\nUS defence officials said the Black Hawk was being flown by an experienced crew on routine training.\n\nTrump said investigators were trying to determine whether the troops were using night vision equipment, which \u201cmay change your view\u201d from the cockpit.

But other experts insist\u00a0there are good reasons to think the devastating pathogen emerged from a market where animals are traded.\n\nBeijing has never fully co-operated with international investigators, impeding the search for a definitive answer. But scientists continue their quest to establish the causes of a global health crisis that killed millions of people, caused trillions of dollars of economic damage and increased fears over the risks of virus research.\n\nThe CIA said on Saturday that the Sars-Cov-2 coronavirus was \u201cmore likely\u201d to have a \u201cresearch-related\u201d origin than a natural one.\n\nBut the CIA said it had \u201clow confidence\u201d in its conclusion, which came after its new director John Ratcliffe took office and urged the agency to \u201cget off the sidelines\u201d in its analysis of the pathogen\u2019s origins. Its assessment gave no indications of having drawn on new intelligence and was the product of a review ordered by the Biden administration near the end of its time in office.\n\nThe CIA\u2019s statement is the latest from US politicians and agencies that lean towards the lab leak theory. Some Republican lawmakers have used the hypothesis as part of a broader critique of China\u2019s handling of the outbreak. Beijing has denied that either the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a leading centre for coronavirus research, or the Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control were the initial virus source.\n\nAsked about the CIA statement this week, China\u2019s foreign ministry said the US should \u201cstop politicising and weaponising origins-tracing\u201d.\n\nMany authorities internationally have yet to take a strong position on Covid\u2019s origins, while stressing that they back World Health Organization efforts to establish it. The UK\u2019s health ministry said a \u201crobust, transparent and science-led review\u201d would \u201cbetter prevent\u201d future pandemics.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s relations with Beijing deteriorated when Chinese officials did not allow the health body to probe Covid\u2019s origins thoroughly. This month the organisation said it was a \u201cmoral and scientific imperative\u201d for China to offer the necessary data and access.\n\nIts advocates believe that if a potent new coronavirus appears in a city that was a centre for research into such pathogens, then a lab was probably the origin.\n\nThe Wuhan institute\u2019s work reflected a growing focus on the threat posed by diseases of animal origin. Such zoonotic coronaviruses are thought to have caused the Sars and Mers outbreaks in 2002 and 2012. The institute sometimes worked with US partners on US government-funded projects, such as 2015 \u201cgain-of-function\u201d experiments that made coronaviruses deadlier for research purposes.\n\nThe lab leak idea has spawned various sub-theories. One is that Sars-Cov-2 was being investigated by researchers having been gathered from a bat or other wild animal. Another is that the pathogen was created by modifying a natural coronavirus. This could have been done either by a process of artificially accelerated evolution known as serial passaging, or by genetic engineering.\n\nProponents of the lab leak hypothesis acknowledge the lack of supporting proof but argue this is impossible to gather without Chinese co-operation.\n\n\u201cThere is not a smoking gun, but there\u2019s a gun laying on the table and it\u2019s warm to the touch,\u201d said Jamie Metzl, a former member of a WHO advisory committee on genome editing. \u201cThere is all of this circumstantial evidence.\u201d\n\nMany scientists still favour a scenario that Covid, like other coronaviruses, emerged in animals and then passed to humans. According to this model, the likely starting point was contact between wild creatures and humans in a Wuhan wet market where early Covid cases were identified.\n\nThe theory found support in research published last year on environmental samples taken from Huanan Seafood Market in the central Chinese city in January 2020. It pinpointed a stall where all the Sars-Cov-2 positive swabs contained traces of wildlife DNA too, showing both animals and virus were present at the same location. The samples included genetic material from species such as raccoon dogs, civets and bamboo rats. All these creatures had been identified as\u00a0possible sources of virus transmission to humans.\n\n\u201cMultiple plausible intermediate hosts of Sars-Cov-2 were present at the exact site within Wuhan to which Covid-19 was first epidemiologically linked,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nCritics allege the market origin theory is flawed. They say it gives too little weight to reports of human Covid cases as early as November 2019. The market hypothesis also includes the contested suggestion that there were at least two separate spillover events there from animals to humans, helping seed an epidemic.\n\nThe scientists behind last year\u2019s study say neither of these points undermines the idea that the market was the source of Covid. They contend that Sars-Cov-2 genetic material in the January 2020 samples could have been deposited weeks before, consistent with the reports of Covid cases in November 2019. Professor Florence D\u00e9barre, an evolutionary biologist and co-author of the research, said a market origin was \u201clikely whether or not there were multiple spillovers\u201d.\n\nThe CIA had not provided corroborating information for its lab leak assessment, D\u00e9barre noted, adding:\u00a0\u201cI hope that the data and logic leading to the conclusion of the various elements of the US intelligence community will one day be made public.\u201d\n\nGain of function research involves manipulating pathogens to probe their behaviour by enhancing properties such as transmissibility and ability to cause disease. The work may be done for valid reasons such as development of vaccines or other ways to combat emerging pathogens.\n\nBut the rules governing its research remain patchy, with no international governance regime in place.\n\nLast year the US government tightened rules on gain of function research. Some experts argue the revised rules, which were weakened from an initial plan that some scientists warned could hobble work on less hazardous pathogens, have troubling gaps.\n\nThe focus on federally funded research pays insufficient attention to non-federally financed work and experiments on novel pathogens, said Alina Chan, a viral vector engineer at MIT and Harvard\u2019s Broad Institute.\n\n\u201cThe prediction of pandemic risk arising from novel experiments is difficult even for multidisciplinary teams of experts, and a self-reporting system is inadequate as evidenced by past incidents,\u201d Chan wrote in a paper published last month.\n\nUS politicians such as Senator Rand Paul have long called for closer scrutiny of gain of function research.

Military experts believe the PLA\u2019s lack of integration is among its biggest weaknesses compared with the US armed forces.\n\n\u201cIf confirmed, this new advanced underground command bunker for the military leadership, including President Xi as the chairman of the Central Military Commission, signals Beijing\u2019s intent to build not only a world-class conventional force but also an advanced nuclear warfighting capability,\u201d said Dennis Wilder, the former head of China analysis for the CIA.\n\nThe Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the US intelligence community, did not comment on the project. The Chinese embassy in Washington said it was \u201cnot aware of the details\u201d but stressed that China was \u201ccommitted to the path of peaceful development and a defence policy that is defensive in nature\u201d.\n\nRenny Babiarz,\u00a0a former imagery analyst at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency who has analysed imagery of the area, said there were at least 100 cranes working over a 5 sq km area developing underground infrastructure.\n\n\u201cImagery analysis suggests the construction of several possible underground facilities linked via possible underground passageways, although additional data and information is needed to more fully assess this construction,\u201d said Babiarz, now vice-president of analysis and operations at AllSource Analysis, a geospatial analysis service group.\n\nThe site was busy with construction activity earlier this month, in contrast to a dearth of development in most big real estate projects in China, which has been gripped by a property sector crisis. There were no showrooms typically associated with a commercial real estate project. Unusually for a commercial project, there are no official mentions of the construction site on the internet in Chinese.\n\nWhile there was no visible military presence at the site, there were signs warning against flying drones or taking photographs.\u00a0Guards at one gate abruptly said that entry was prohibited and refused to talk about the project. One supervisor leaving the construction site refused to comment on the project.\n\nAccess to the back of the project has been blocked by a checkpoint. A guard said the public could not access popular hiking and tourist areas near the site, which a local shopkeeper described as a\u00a0\u201cmilitary area\u201d.\n\nOne former senior US intelligence official said that while the PLA\u2019s current headquarters in central Beijing was fairly new it was not designed to be a secure combat command centre.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s main secure command centre is in the Western Hills, north-east of the new facility, and was built decades ago at the height of the cold war,\u201d said the former official. \u201cThe size, scale and partially buried characteristics of the new facility suggest it will replace the Western Hills complex as the primary wartime command facility.\n\n\u201cChinese leaders may judge that the new facility will enable greater security against US \u2018bunker buster\u2019 munitions, and even against nuclear weapons,\u201d the former intelligence official added. \u201cIt can also incorporate more advanced and secure communications and have room for expanding PLA capabilities and missions.\u201d\n\nOne China researcher familiar with the images said the site had \u201call the hallmarks of a sensitive military facility\u201d, including heavily reinforced concrete and deep underground tunnelling.\n\n\u201cNearly 10 times bigger than the Pentagon, it\u2019s fitting for Xi Jinping\u2019s ambitions to surpass the US,\u201d said the researcher. \u201cThis fortress only serves one purpose, which is to act as a doomsday bunker for China\u2019s increasingly sophisticated and capable military.\u201d\n\nThe construction of the site comes amid a multi-year redevelopment of Beijing\u2019s western outskirts. But there has been speculation online in China about why houses in the Qinglonghu area were being razed.\n\nIn one post on Baidu Zhidao, the Chinese search engine\u2019s equivalent of Quora, one user said: \u201cAre they going to build the Chinese Pentagon in Qinglonghu?\u201d\n\nTwo people close to Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry also said the PLA appeared to be building a new command centre, though some experts questioned if the area was suitable for underground bunkers.\n\n\u201cThe land area is much larger than a normal military camp and military school, so it can only be assumed that it is a site for an administrative organisation or a large training base,\u201d said Hsu Yen-chi, a researcher at the Council on Strategic and Wargaming Studies think-tank in Taipei.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f3763e51-8607-42b9-9ef9-5789d5bf353d"}, {"title": "OpenAI says it has evidence China\u2019s DeepSeek used its model to train competitor", "description": "White House AI tsar David Sacks raises possibility of alleged intellectual property theft", "author": "Eleanor Olcott", "published_date": "2025-01-29T07:08:41.382Z", "content": "OpenAI says it has found evidence that Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek used the US company\u2019s proprietary models to train its own open-source competitor, as concerns grow over a potential breach of intellectual property.\n\nThe San Francisco-based ChatGPT maker told the Financial Times it had seen some evidence of \u201cdistillation\u201d, which it suspects to be from DeepSeek.\n\nThe technique is used by developers to obtain better performance on smaller models by using outputs from larger, more capable ones, allowing them to achieve similar results on specific tasks at a much lower cost.\n\nDistillation is a common practice in the industry but the concern was that DeepSeek may be doing it to build its own rival model, which is a breach of OpenAI\u2019s terms of service.\n\n\u201cThe issue is when you [take it out of the platform and] are doing it to create your own model for your own purposes,\u201d said one person close to OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment further or provide details of its evidence.

Its built-on-a-shoestring models have attained high rankings and comparable results to leading US models.\n\nShares in Nvidia fell 17 per cent on Monday, wiping $589bn off its market value, on fears that big investments in its expensive AI hardware might not be needed. They recovered by 9 per cent on Tuesday, along with other tech stocks.\n\nOpenAI and its partner Microsoft investigated accounts believed to be DeepSeek\u2019s last year that were using OpenAI\u2019s application programming interface (API) and blocked their access on suspicion of distillation that violated the terms of service, another person with direct knowledge said. These investigations were first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this detail. DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment made during the lunar new year holiday.\n\nEarlier, President Donald Trump\u2019s AI and crypto tsar David Sacks said \u201cit is possible\u201d that IP theft had occurred.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a technique in AI called distillation\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009when one model learns from another model [and] kind of sucks the knowledge out of the parent model,\u201d Sacks told Fox News on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI models, and I don\u2019t think OpenAI is very happy about this,\u201d Sacks added, although he did not provide evidence.\n\nDeepSeek said it used just 2,048 Nvidia H800 graphics cards and spent $5.6mn to train its V3 model with 671bn parameters, a fraction of what OpenAI and Google spent to train comparably sized models. Some experts said the model generated responses that indicated it had been trained on outputs from OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, which would violate its terms of service.\n\nIndustry insiders say that it is common practice for AI labs in China and the US to use outputs from companies such as OpenAI, which have invested in hiring people to teach their models how to produce responses that sound more human. This is expensive and labour-intensive, and smaller players often piggyback off this work, say the insiders.\n\n\u201cIt is a very common practice for start-ups and academics to use outputs from human-aligned commercial LLMs, like ChatGPT, to train another model,\u201d said Ritwik Gupta, a PhD candidate in AI at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\u201cThat means you get this human feedback step for free. It is not surprising to me that DeepSeek supposedly would be doing the same. If they were, stopping this practice precisely may be difficult,\u201d he added.\n\nThe practice highlights the difficulty for companies keen to protect their technical edge. \u201cWe know [China]-based companies \u2014 and others \u2014 are constantly trying to distil the models of leading US AI companies,\u201d OpenAI said in its latest statement.\n\nIt added: \u201cWe engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models, and believe\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.\u201d\n\nOpenAI is battling allegations of its own copyright infringement from newspapers and content creators, including lawsuits from The New York Times and prominent authors, who accuse the company of training its models on their articles and books without permission.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a0dfedd1-5255-4fa9-8ccc-1fe01de87ea6"}, {"title": "Beijing-backed lending boosts China\u2019s dominance in clean energy minerals", "description": "Entities loaned billions to create mining and processing supply chain, report shows", "author": "Haohsiang Ko", "published_date": "2025-01-28T22:00:46.585Z", "content": "China has built up control of critical minerals across the developing world over the course of two decades through a network of at least 26 state-backed financial institutions, according to a new report that traces the country\u2019s financing strategy.\n\nResearch published on Wednesday found that Chinese policy and commercial banks \u2014 working alongside private Chinese entities and some non-Chinese groups \u2014 issued loans worth nearly $57bn from 2000 to 2021 in 19 low- and middle-income countries for mining and processing copper, cobalt, nickel, lithium and rare earths, components critical to clean energy technologies such as electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.\n\nThe study by AidData at the College of William & Mary in the US, which was reviewed by the Financial Times, attempts to capture the extent of China\u2019s financing of extractive projects in the developing world. The research highlights the scale of the challenge faced by the west in countering China\u2019s control of the global supply chain for emerging green-tech industries.\n\n\u201cGiven that China\u2019s financing model enables its companies to outmanoeuvre competitors in capital-intensive mineral sectors, its rivals need to develop more compelling and competitive financing arrangements that are responsive to the preferences of host countries,\u201d said Brooke Escobar, who leads AidData\u2019s Chinese development finance programme.\n\nThe research shows that more than three-quarters of China\u2019s state-backed transition mineral financing \u2014 via both debt and equity \u2014 in the developing world was channelled to projects where Chinese entities held ownership stakes in joint ventures and special purpose vehicles.\n\nThese entities have long-term control over the extraction and processing of strategic mineral deposits, including copper from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru as well as Indonesia\u2019s nickel and Argentina\u2019s lithium reserves.\n\nThe data was compiled from the loan recipients and is rarely disclosed by Chinese financial institutions.\n\nChina\u2019s transition minerals financing differs from Beijing\u2019s traditional lending practices in the infrastructure-focused Belt and Road Initiative, one of President Xi Jinping\u2019s hallmark foreign development policies, the AidData researchers argued.\n\nUnlike most loans made for BRI projects, which are dominated by a handful of Chinese development banks, the network of lenders to the mineral sector was much broader.\n\nBeijing\u2019s state-owned commercial banks, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and Citic, play the largest role.\n\nHowever, a much larger network of 86 entities, including 26 Chinese official sector entities as well as scores of private Chinese companies and some non-Chinese financiers, also provided financing alongside Chinese state-backed participants in syndicated loans. This represents a much more diversified creditor base than traditional BRI lending.\n\nICBC, BoC and Citic did not respond to requests for comment on the data, nor did seven other large Chinese banks contacted by the FT.\n\nThe minerals lending also mostly involved serial lending, rather than one-off loans, in contrast to the BRI. State lenders initially provided an acquisition loan to help a Chinese company gain an ownership stake in a mine, before further credit facilities were extended for development and to provide working capital.\n\nThe BRI has also been marred by the issue of low-income countries struggling to repay hundreds of billions of dollars and allegations of \u201cdebt trap diplomacy\u201d after a spate of sovereign debt defaults.\n\nBut AidData showed that about one-quarter of China\u2019s mineral lending was backed by a Chinese guarantor, compared with an estimated 4 per cent in Beijing\u2019s broader overseas lending portfolio, reflecting an increased emphasis on risk mitigation and safeguarding investment returns.\n\nThe lending was mostly targeted at upstream resource extraction, AidData said. This helped secure China\u2019s access to raw materials, creating a vertically integrated Chinese-controlled supply chain, while avoiding competing with its own domestic mineral processing industry.\n\nThe data showed that two-thirds of the financing went into JVs or SPVs where the host government held no significant level of ownership. Bypassing local governments reduced those countries\u2019 financial liabilities but also potentially limited their access to future financial returns, the researchers noted.\n\nChina\u2019s dominance in many cleantech sectors is expected to expand over the next 10 years, forecasts suggested, despite the US and Europe handing out hundreds of billions of dollars in industrial subsidies as well as rising protectionism via tariffs and bans on Chinese-made products.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9419aa64-33ce-4ed5-ba97-7d0aebbeb48f"}, {"title": "China\u2019s emboldened AI industry releases flurry of model updates", "description": "Success of DeepSeek inspires confidence as latest products are pushed out ahead of lunar new year holiday", "author": "Eleanor Olcott", "published_date": "2025-01-28T09:36:13.382Z", "content": "Chinese artificial intelligence groups have been rushing out model updates before the lunar new year holiday, as the world wakes up to the sector\u2019s major advances led by start-up DeepSeek in the face of US chip restrictions.\n\nOn Monday, the eve of China\u2019s most important annual holiday, the Hangzhou-based company released a new open-source model for image generation, cementing its reputation as the disrupter-in-chief in a field previously dominated by US giants. It came hot on the heels of model releases from tech giant Alibaba and start-ups Moonshot and Zhipu.\n\n\u201cThis is the equivalent of dropping a massive release on Christmas Eve. We\u2019ve all been working overtime to get stuff out before the holiday,\u201d said one product manager at a large language model start-up.\n\nWhile DeepSeek\u2019s achievement has prompted panic in the US about the advances Chinese labs are making on bootstrapped budgets, industry insiders say it is feeding into a newfound \u201cconfidence\u201d in China that will spur investment.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek has made faster progress than the other Chinese model companies. But this is giving them confidence that they can catch up,\u201d said one AI investor in China.\n\nDeepSeek has captured the world\u2019s attention with a series of model releases that show similar performance to those of US rivals such as OpenAI and Meta, even though it claims to have a fraction of the computing resources and is blocked from acquiring the latest Nvidia processors by US export restrictions. Last week, it released its R1 reasoning model, an advanced model that rivals OpenAI\u2019s o1 and can automatically learn and improve itself without human supervision.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek has injected a lot of energy into China\u2019s AI players and, more broadly, into the global open-source AI community that will use its findings from its R1 paper to make progress on reasoning models,\u201d said Wang Tiezhen, an engineer at AI research hub Hugging Face.\n\nThis week, investors dumped AI-related stocks, with Nvidia losing almost $600bn in market value on Monday. They were reacting to Chinese breakthroughs that show it is possible to build powerful models while pursuing a different strategy to the US one of building ever-larger computing clusters to get ahead in the AI race.\n\nOn Monday, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen released Qwen2.5-1M, a series of new models that are capable of handling longer inputs, an important development that would mean the model could be deployed for AI agent applications with higher memory demands, according to Wang.\n\nOn the same day, DeepSeek released Janus-Pro, a text-to-image generation model that it claims can surpass state of the art ones from competitors such as OpenAI\u2019s Dall-E 3 and Stability AI\u2019s Stable Diffusion 3 on some benchmarks.\n\nZhipu, valued at its last funding round in December at $3bn, last week released an update to GLM-PC. The AI agent model is aimed at enterprise customers, enabling computers to automatically complete tasks such as filling out forms or digesting financial reports.\n\nWhile Zhipu has not courted much attention for its LLM development, it has a lead among local AI start-ups in commercialising its technology, with support from local governments and state-owned enterprises that have partnered with the Beijing-based company to deploy its models.\n\nLast week, another Beijing-based start-up Moonshot, which owns the popular AI chatbot Kimi, updated its reasoning model to Kimi k1.5, demonstrating strong results compared with established AI models for complex reasoning tasks. The latest release can process texts and images while handling long and complex queries.\n\nIt is standard practice for Chinese tech companies to release products before the long holiday, with the added benefit that potential customers with lots of free time during the break can test and explore them.\n\nOnce Chinese AI players return from their break, the race is on to become the leading player developing AI applications for commercial use. \u201cIf AI agents can create dramatic commercial value, one or two of the LLM players have a chance to transform into a new generation of software companies,\u201d the AI investor said.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/036cb510-5cf2-4dd8-9aec-1341396dfc2a"}, {"title": "A young couple paid for a luxury maternity home.

But beds at the YueGe post-partum confinement centre filled up quickly. The room wasn\u2019t cheap, at Rmb150,000, or about $21,000, for 28 days. But unlike a normal hotel, it came with its own team of professional nurses and nannies. They would observe the new mother and her baby during the day and help with feeds at night. Twice a week, a doctor would check on the mother\u2019s recovery. Meals would be tailored to her needs. At such a life-changing moment, there would be nothing for the new parents to worry about.\n\nEmma and Alan had looked at several centres in Shanghai, but YueGe\u2019s stood out. Online reviews raved, saying even the staff were well treated. They\u2019d spoken to a manager, Wang, for two hours and been impressed. It helped that his boss, Liang, was from Taiwan, where the tradition of confinement had first emerged as a modern industry.\n\nEmma is 34 and works in finance. Her friends were \u201call doing it\u201d too, but that wasn\u2019t the reason she found the idea of confinement so attractive. Nor had she immediately thought about the health benefits of the ancient practice, such as the need to avoid the cold of the wind entering your bones (a risk even at the height of summer). It was just appealing, the thought of having so many people to look after you. Plus, if she stayed at home, as her parents\u2019 generation did, the excited new grandparents would end up moving into the couple\u2019s two-bedroom apartment. They would \u201cinterfere\u201d, and there would be all kinds of family conflict. No, in the confinement centre, she would be in charge.\n\nIn return for a discount, Emma and Alan agreed to pay upfront. At YueGe, the care was so attentive that a chat group was set up just for them, with seven or eight members of staff in it. The couple also attended three lectures at the site. But one Sunday in March, just two months before their baby was due, they received a strange message.\n\nPurportedly sent by staff at the centre, the message explained in vague language that YueGe had undergone \u201cstructural changes\u201d that were \u201cbeyond the authority and scope of the staff\u201d. It\u00a0went on to say the staff\u2019s own wages were also in arrears, and they would take legal action. The message added that any other questions would need to be directed towards the managers Wang and Liang, who were copied in. It also listed another company: Beikang.\n\nAlan and Emma didn\u2019t know what had happened, but the implication was clear: YueGe had run out of money, including their advance payment, and there would be no month of confinement.\n\nEmma\u2019s first response was to go on to the internet, where she now came across rumblings of discontent about the centre. She also found a QR code of the kind that is common in China. It allowed the couple to enter into a WeChat weiquanqun, or \u201cgroup for the protection of rights\u201d. It was already full of other parents-to-be. \u201cWe realised,\u201d says Alan, \u201cthat this was a very serious matter.\u201d\n\nThe concept of \u201crights protection\u201d has its roots, including a sense of powerlessness in the courts, in the legal code that emerged in China following the end of strict communism in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, it is most associated with the risks facing consumers who experience gyms closing midway through their contracts or property investment schemes going awry. While many see no option but to show up at the doors of the business itself seeking redress, social media has given aggrieved consumers somewhere to organise themselves.\n\nEveryone in the newly created chat group had received the same vague text message, naming the two managers of YueGe. Wang was the manager who had met Alan and Emma. Liang\u2019s Taiwanese nationality was, as one of few salient facts available, a focus for suspicion. \u201cWe need to stop Liang from fleeing to Taiwan,\u201d wrote one user, echoing a widely held concern in mainland China over insiders absconding with company funds. But if that did happen, said another user, all might not be lost: \u201cThey hold people accountable [there], more than we can in the mainland.\u201d\n\nSome scrutinised the timing of the discounts people had been offered. \u201cMr Liang urged us to pay on November 26, and his WeChat moments stopped updating on November 28,\u201d wrote one user. More messages emerged, indicating that in February, further discounts had been offered in return for full payment upfront, seemingly to plug some kind of cash shortage. \u201cThe Taiwanese guy called me and said the same thing, full payment before the Lantern festival.\u201d \u201cPremeditated,\u201d said another user, in the absence of any other explanations. (The FT was unable to contact either Liang or Wang.)\n\nEmma and Alan were content to quietly observe the discussion in the WeChat group, not wanting to draw attention to themselves. Besides, it was almost impossible to be sure who was sharing information. Despite the participants being Chinese, most of their usernames were in English or interspersed with emojis \u2014 not unusual in an internet environment where people often seek to obscure their identity.\n\nThe question of who could help was similarly unclear. One user had gone to the China Consumers Association, but it told him to contact the Health Bureau which, it claimed, regulated post-partum confinement centres. \u201cAre there any friends here who understand the law?\u201d he asked in bewilderment. Another claimed to be at a police station, where officers said that they could not file a case. Instead the advice was to go to the head office of the relevant company.\n\nIn the absence of clear identities, people were mainly distinguished by how much noise they made. The most prominent voice belonged to a user whose name included a bee emoji, and who claimed to \u201cspecialise in complaints\u201d. When it came to the art of protecting rights, she was a natural, recalled Alan. She too had contacted the police, who told her this was a contract dispute, and nothing to do with them.\n\n\u201cThe first thing the policeman said to me,\u201d she wrote on the Sunday the group was formed, was: \u201cAre you just one person, or are there a lot of you?\u201d \u201cIt was then that I understood,\u201d she continued, \u201cthat as just one person, he didn\u2019t care at all.\u201d\n\nBut with around 100 people now claiming to be victims, there was growing hope of recovery. Bee emoji suggested the group find a time to report the incident together. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t getting your money,\u201d she told them, \u201cit\u2019s because you aren\u2019t making enough noise.\u201d\n\nDespite their widespread confidence in the Taiwan theory, by Monday, the group\u2019s focus had begun to shift to the other company named in the original message, Beikang, which they mostly referred to as Saint Bella, the brand name for which it is best known. The company, launched by 38-year-old entrepreneur Xiang Hua in 2017, describes itself as \u201ca family care group with a leading post-partum care and recovery operation\u201d, and in 2023 had revenues of Rmb560mn, the second biggest from post-partum centres in China that year. Last year, it launched an IPO application in Hong Kong.\n\nThe company has a network of 72 \u201cpremium post-partum centers\u201d, including one in Los Angeles which opened last year. It has also made a series of acquisitions. In December 2022, it carried out due diligence on the parent company of YueGe, called YueZiGe (a play on the Chinese word for confinement). The purchase of YueZiGe went through in February 2024, just a month before Emma and Alan received the news about their confinement centre.\n\nFor those who still had no idea what had happened to their money, Saint Bella now seemed to offer the best hope of compensation. Some in the group focused on the company\u2019s indirect ownership stake in YueGe. Its potential vulnerability to negative publicity was also weighed, given the impending IPO. (One user referred to a complaints page on the Hong Kong stock exchange, another suggested exposing those responsible on a nationwide TV gala held on world consumer rights day.) Further suspicion was aroused when it was noted that online posts mentioning the company in relation to the scandal had been \u201charmonised\u201d \u2014 a euphemism in China for deleted online content.\n\nMeanwhile, members of the group were increasingly heading to confinement sites in person in the hope of finding and confronting responsible parties. That Monday evening, one user claimed to be at the YueGe site where Alan and Emma first visited. \u201cBoss Wang and Boss Liang are here,\u201d she wrote, and Saint Bella was on its way.\n\nAt 6.04pm, another user posted a livestream link from the site on Xiaohongshu, a social media platform with over 300 million users, to the group. In an environment used to highly sophisticated online censorship, what happened next still sowed confusion.\n\n\u201cHas the stream finished?\u201d someone asked a quarter of an hour later, at 6.20pm. \u201cIt\u2019s been taken down,\u201d another replied.\n\nThe link was posted twice more, at 6.23pm and 6.31pm. On both occasions it lasted only a few minutes before apparently being taken down.\n\nAt 6.34pm, the link was posted one final time. Five minutes later another user posted: \u201cIt\u2019s been turned off?\u201d\n\nFor those watching, any hope of finding answers live from the confinement site had been frustrated. But Emma and Alan were beginning to notice something strange. The people who made the most noise soon became very quiet, and those who went to the sites \u201cdidn\u2019t tell us anything\u201d after they came back.\n\nBy Tuesday, with few other options available, Emma decided the only possible course of action left was to make a scene of her own. In\u00a0another \u201crights protection\u201d WeChat group she had joined, she proposed heading to the same confinement site with red protest banners with white characters, in the style of those used to display government slogans. Within two hours, as though someone was watching closely, her phone rang. It was Saint Bella, with a simple message:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d\n\nThe office building where they met Saint Bella near Shanghai\u2019s Nanjing West Road looked rundown, said Alan. \u201cYou simply couldn\u2019t believe it\u2019s the same company if you compare it with the post-partum centres.\u201d\n\nFrom the start, 48 hours earlier, his reaction to the entire affair had been to comfort his pregnant wife, and to avoid showing too much emotion. That Tuesday morning, before they were invited to the meeting, he had been to the police station on his own. As expected, he found no legal solution. But he had encountered some other parents-to-be there, some of whom said they had negotiated a deal with Saint Bella, and he was afraid of missing out.\n\nOn the WeChat group there were also rumours that some, after protesting on site, had received an offer of a 40 per cent refund, a free nanny during their confinement month at home, and meal delivery. Others suggested there was another choice: discounts on rooms in other centres that the company ran in Shanghai, if they were willing to pay again. The claims attracted suspicion. One user deployed the term shui jun, referring to someone who is paid to post online, in response to a user who linked to an article about compensation.\n\nWord of behind-the-scenes offers also exposed a disunity among the largely anonymous group. Saint Bella is \u201ccrossing the river by feeling each stone\u201d, posted someone, referring to a famous quote from former leader of China, Deng Xiaoping. \u201cIt is dealing with you one by one, defeating you one by one, so that you will not gather together or post on social media.\u201d \u201cSomething I just don\u2019t understand,\u201d added one user, \u201cis if the two Taiwanese managers did this, and SBL completely didn\u2019t know about it, why haven\u2019t they sued them?\u201d (There is no indication Wang is Taiwanese.) \u201cThey definitely cannot not know about this,\u201d replied another.\n\nIn the office building, Emma and Alan sat around a table with five people, one of whom told them she represented all of the group\u2019s sites in Shanghai. There was one small window in the room, and the lights were extremely bright. The company was indeed offering them a 40 per cent refund, or a discount on a new centre. The woman claimed that because the company had only 30 per cent of the shares in the centre, this was more than it needed to offer. Alan, who like his wife works in finance, contested this. \u201cDon\u2019t think we are so easy to fool,\u201d he said. In his view, it was \u201csophistry\u201d. The woman got angry. \u201cWe can\u2019t rule out suing you directly,\u201d she said.\n\nAt this Alan said his emotions got the better of him. \u201cI usually pretend to be angry in negotiations,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I really was angry.\u201d The negotiation broke down. He slammed the table. In hindsight, his outburst proved helpful. It prompted an additional discount of Rmb40,000 on the new centre, though it would still cost the couple Rmb60,000 (about $8,200) on top of what they had spent already. The deal required them to sign a document saying they would not talk about Saint Bella in the media, on social media or in the rights group, nor would they take legal action against it. Saint Bella declined to comment on the meeting.\n\nAfter three hours, Alan and Emma left. There was another family waiting outside.\n\nThe following day, under the name Beikang International and referencing its Saint Bella brand, the company released a statement distancing itself from the operations of YueGe, the company at the centre of the controversy. Neither Emma nor Alan remembers seeing it specifically, though similar points emerged in the WeChat group.\n\nAccording to the company, it never intended to have any involvement with YueGe. Its connection came through a sprawl of subsidiaries typical of mainland China. The statement said that in February 2024 it had acquired a majority stake in YueZiGe, a post-partum centre business in Shanghai previously associated with a Taiwanese woman. But YueZiGe, in turn, owned a majority stake in a consultancy company, which in turn owned a majority stake in YueGe (the statement mentioned Liang by name as legal representative, but did not mention Wang). As a result, Beikang said it had a 23.35 per cent indirect stake in YueGe.\n\nAs a minority shareholder at the time of the incident, the company said it did \u201cnot bear any legal responsibility\u201d for YueGe\u2019s insolvency.\n\nSaint Bella\u2019s founder, Xiang Hua, declined to comment. But in a further statement provided to the FT, the company said it became aware of the incident with YueGe only after employees and clients, given public knowledge of the above stake, began to claim compensation from it.\n\nThe company said that \u201cdespite bearing no fault or responsibility for this incident\u201d, it \u201cprovided emergency support\u201d to affected customers, employees and matrons \u201cout of a sense of social responsibility\u201d.\n\nThe company declined to comment on the removal of online content. The official statement released in March, which hit out against \u201cfalse statements and malicious accusations\u201d, was later taken down from Xiaohongshu, the platform where it was initially published. \u201cWe removed the statement once the issue subsided to better focus on core business activities,\u201d the company said, adding it was still publicly available elsewhere.\n\nIt also said a loan from YueZiGe to YueGe was made in August 2023, before its acquisition of the former company was complete. It said the loan was unrelated to Beikang, and it was unaware of any operational issues at the time. After the incident arose, it said it sought assistance from regulatory authorities and had filed a lawsuit against YueGe to recover the loan. It said it no longer has any indirect stake.\n\nAs for what had given rise to the complaints of YueGe customers, the original statement had a simple explanation: \u201cpoor management\u201d.\n\nIn May, Emma gave birth to a daughter, Sherry. In line with the deal, she completed her post-partum confinement at another Shanghai site associated with Saint Bella. Part of a luxurious hotel, the brightly lit rooms at the site are full of green plants. A timetable of activities for mothers, including meditation, is propped up by the wall. Guests must spray their shoes and hands with disinfectant before entering. Emma and Alan said they were pleased with the experience.\n\nOne of the last discussions on the WeChat group was about how much money had been collectively involved, calculated through a list function. The total came to about Rmb4mn-5mn ($550,000 \u2014$690,000), an amount that might easily fly under the radar in terms of attracting wider attention. Local broadcast state media in Shanghai did cover the story, talk of which rippled through the city, though participants\u2019 faces were blurred out.\n\nThe group soon fell quiet, but intriguing messages occasionally trickled through, including a YueGe doctor\u2019s claim on March 13 that he had not been paid for eight months, since, he said, Beikang had become involved, and that in the eight years working with YueGe and YueZiGe prior to that, he had always been paid on time. The company did not comment on the post.\n\nThen, on March 26, a message appeared that was longer and more detailed than any that had come before. This poster alleged that he had reported the incident to the police on Monday March 11 2024, and had now received a reply: making reference to transfers between YueGe and YueZiGe, the police said no misappropriation of funds could be determined and no case could be filed.\n\nDespite this the poster claimed YueGe\u2019s operating funds were transferred out of the company through a loan agreement, including the last few deposits from parents-to-be, and that Wang and Liang had told him this at the time of the complaint. Owing to the \u201cequity arrangement\u201d, the poster suggested Saint Bella could remove money from its subsidiaries and offer compensation at a proportion of the amount. He added that the settlement agreement with Saint Bella had been signed by his wife, and did not bind him. \u201cThey\u2019ve done something beautiful,\u201d replied bee emoji.\n\nSaint Bella did not comment on the post in the rights group WeChat. But in its statement to the FT, the company said it won its case against YueGe over the August 2023 loan. It did not respond to requests about whether any of the funds were recovered, but provided screenshots of court documents from October 31 last year, which showed a Shanghai court ordered YueGe to repay a loan principal amount of Rmb2mn, as well as interest and damages.\n\nOne other party was absent from the conversation: the Taiwanese woman associated with YueZiGe. Could she have helped to resolve the situation at YueGe? In its statement to the FT, Saint Bella said the other shareholder was \u201cunable to participate due to illness\u201d. The FT was unable to contact the woman.\n\nIn Shanghai, there are no longer any signs of YueGe. The site Emma and Alan first visited is still a confinement centre, but on the 16th floor nurses now wear badges with the name Baby Bella, one of the Saint Bella group\u2019s several brands across the 25 cities in which it operates.\n\nSometimes Alan finds himself telling the story to friends and colleagues. One time he scrutinised the WeChat account of Wang, the manager who had so impressed them. He found only the vaguest of clues, a one-word signature. \u201cRensheng\u201d it said, a Chinese word meaning \u201clife\u201d, followed by five dots and a single question mark.\n\nThomas Hale is the FT\u2019s Shanghai correspondent.

The pressure on the 45-year-old billionaire ramped up further this month, after Washington sanctioned his other companies that design and source artificial intelligence processors.\n\nIt is not the first time that Zhan\u2019s ambitions to build China\u2019s answer to Nvidia have jeopardised his business empire. Bitmain was nearly undone five years ago by his heavy spending to develop AI chips, sparking a civil war with his co-founder for control of the company.\n\nWhile Bitmain continues to focus on crypto mining, Zhan subsequently shifted those AI chip efforts into Xiamen Sophgo Technologies, which along with 15 affiliates, was added to the US commerce department entity list this month.\n\nThe company\u2019s troubles began when an AI processor made by the world\u2019s premier chip fabricator, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, was found in a Huawei AI card, allegedly circumventing sanctions. TSMC began investigating if it was purchased by Sophgo.\n\nThe US said that Sophgo posed a risk of diversion to Huawei and alleged it was \u201cacting at the behest of Beijing\u201d to build up China\u2019s indigenous chip production.\n\nSophgo, Bitmain and Zhan did not respond to requests for comment. Sophgo has previously denied working with Huawei and Bitmain said it was not involved in the matter.\n\nTSMC declined to comment on customer relationships but said that, as a law-abiding company, it was committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations including export controls.\n\nZhan\u2019s latest challenges show the hurdles Chinese entrepreneurs face, particularly for those keen to make a mark in semiconductors, where the whiplash of US-China geopolitics has set back many of the country\u2019s most ambitious tech companies.\n\nPeople with knowledge of Sophgo\u2019s operations describe a number of semiconductor related business lines. They include designing in-house AI processors and central processing units for supercomputers, as well as sourcing cutting edge Nvidia graphics processing units for Chinese data centres.\n\nThe US blacklisting formally cuts Sophgo off from TSMC, and could potentially pose challenges for its partner Bitmain, which also relies on the Taiwanese chipmaker to manufacture its chips.\n\nPeople close to Bitmain said access to TSMC helped it become the world\u2019s dominant maker of Bitcoin mining rigs with an estimated 80 per cent of the market. For years Bitmain spent hundreds of millions of dollars pre-purchasing TSMC capacity, forcing rival miner makers to turn to other less capable chip foundries, the people said.\n\n\u201cThe energy-efficient chip is the heart of a mining machine,\u201d said Nishant Sharma, founder of crypto mining advisory BlocksBridge Consulting.\n\nZhan was designing chips for TV sets when Bitcoin started to gain traction. In 2013, he turned his technical prowess towards designing specialised processors known as ASICs to more efficiently execute the hashing algorithms that unlock new Bitcoins. By 2017, Bitmain\u2019s sales had jumped to $2.5bn, according to an IPO prospectus. Zhan\u2019s vision for the company expanded towards AI. In the US, Google had just unveiled ASICs for running deep-learning algorithms, which it called TPUs.\n\n\u201cWe are a company focused on high-performance processors,\u201d Zhan told a gathering in Beijing in 2017. \u201cWe started with cryptocurrency processors and now we\u2019re entering artificial intelligence, it\u2019s a new area of application but not a complete pivot.\u201d\n\nBitmain\u2019s first AI chip, the BM1680, was made by TSMC and shipped in 2017. But then the price of bitcoin started to fall, and along with it demand for crypto mining rigs. Hopes for a blockbuster Bitmain IPO in Hong Kong vanished.\n\nThe start-up laid off hundreds of employees and Zhan\u2019s co-founder Wu Jihan ousted him and reined in spending on AI. Zhan fought back by taking control of a Bitmain AI chip unit registered in his hometown of Fujian and sued Wu. The company, Fujian Sophon, told a court that Zhan\u2019s ousting had the potential to change the direction of \u201cour country\u2019s chip and blockchain development\u201d. Eventually Wu left.\n\nIn 2022, Zhan moved Bitmain\u2019s AI chip efforts to Sophgo, which he owned almost entirely when it was set up. The lines between the two companies remain blurry. Bitmain\u2019s and Sophgo\u2019s affiliated entities share some executives, addresses and phone numbers in official Chinese business records. Last year, they jointly sought to recruit new graduates at Harbin Institute of Technology, according to an advert.\n\nOne customer for their AI chips, Haitu Technology, described Sophgo as Bitmain\u2019s \u201crecommended distributor\u201d in a filing to Chinese securities regulators in late 2022. Bitmain itself does not sell its AI processors to small and medium-sized companies, Haitu said.\n\nSophgo has sent its AI processors to public security bureaus and smart city projects in Fujian, Anhui and Beijing, according to a company presentation seen by the Financial Times. Its AI accelerators have also been used to build an AI computing cluster in Shandong.\n\nNick Brown, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh, said the company\u2019s latest CPU, the SG2042, represented a leap forward for the open source RISC-V architecture it was built on, and was comparable with Intel and AMD processors for some supercomputing tasks.\n\n\u201cFor workloads that need lots of computation, lots of processing, lots of calculations, it performs really well,\u201d Brown said, after testing the chips on the university\u2019s supercomputing hardware.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first RISC-V CPU that you could say is a serious proposition for high performance workloads,\u201d said Brown.\n\nPublic records show some Chinese supercomputing centres, which are cut off from American chips, have begun to use Sophgo\u2019s processors.\n\n\u201cOnce Chinese companies gain a foothold, western companies basically stand no chance,\u201d Zhan told a conference in 2019. Now Sophgo will have to figure out how to get its processors made in China.\n\nAdditional reporting by Eleanor Olcott and Nian Liu in Beijing", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/46c48898-c468-45e8-bbaf-b655939c941a"}, {"title": "China\u2019s onetime \u2018solar king\u2019 struggles in US electric bus market", "description": "Denton Peng had hoped to replicate his past successes, but roadblocks emerged in his adopted country", "author": "Sun Yu", "published_date": "2025-01-27T05:01:00.792Z", "content": "Denton Peng, the onetime \u201csolar king\u201d of China who was briefly the country\u2019s youngest billionaire, emigrated to California in 2018 with plans to defibrillate a moribund industry: electric buses. Now several years into the effort, shares of his company Phoenix Motor trade for mere pennies and it has received two delisting warnings from Nasdaq. Despite generous US subsidies to help cities adopt zero-emission mass transit, Phoenix was able to deliver only about 40 buses in 2024, and it has lost money in every year of operation under Peng\u2019s leadership. The story of Phoenix illustrates the inherent challenge of manufacturing electric vehicles in the US and the seemingly quixotic goal of government-backed incentives to get the industry off the ground, much less become competitive with its Chinese counterparts. Though both China and the US have provided seed funding to the fledgling industry, inefficiency and cost structures \u2014 especially for labour \u2014 make western production a long-shot challenge.\n\nOut of the top 10 electric-bus makers in the world, only two are based in the US \u2014 one of which was bought by Peng after it went bankrupt. \u201cPeng is just running into the same issues that many US electric-car makers are facing \u2014 that they can\u2019t build a profitable vehicle without a huge part of their supply chain being from China,\u201d said Tu Le, founder of Sino Auto Insights, a Detroit-based consultancy. \u201cRegardless of how much is reshored, the United States will have a hard time getting to the cost level with China.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s EV industry features a large pool of cheap and productive labour, as well as a highly efficient supply chain few countries can rival.\n\n\u201cIf it takes one month to complete a project in China,\u201d said Peng in an interview with the Financial Times, \u201cit takes four to five in the US.\u201d\n\nGovernment support played a crucial role in driving Peng\u2019s earlier success. When he faced a funding gap to make the profitable yet capital-intensive solar wafer, a key component of solar cells, in 2005, local authorities in China lent him Rmb200mn and encouraged banks to provide more than Rmb25bn lines of credit for his venture, called LDK.\u00a0Chinese press nicknamed him the \u201csolar king\u201d.\n\nBusiness prospered as the company profited from the solar power boom in European countries. The bonanza ended after western nations began imposing sanctions on Chinese solar products in 2012, a blow to LDK that relied on developed markets for growth.\n\nPeng lost control of LDK in 2012 after the local government took over the company. Chinese authorities accused him of fraud related to a subsequent group he launched. Peng denied wrongdoing.\n\nPeng bought Phoenix Motorcars, a California-based electric-bus maker, for $12.5mn as he sought to return to manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThere is a chance I can succeed in making EVs in the US,\u201d he said.\n\nThree years later, Peng paid $10mn to acquire the transit bus operation of Proterra, a leading electric-bus maker that filed for bankruptcy a few months earlier, as he looked to increase capacity to meet orders.\n\nPhoenix merged with Proterra, creating one of the biggest electric-bus makers in the country. There was no shortage of demand for the vehicles as both the federal and state governments made a push to build more environmentally friendly public transit systems.\n\nThe Federal Transit Administration has over the past three years provided $4.9bn in subsidies for local authorities to purchase more than 4,600 zero or low emission buses, mostly electric ones.\n\nWhile the programme is a boon for Phoenix, it comes with a caveat \u2014 the company must locally source more than 70 per cent of its parts, measured by value, to qualify for the subsidy.\n\nThat has slowed down production and created a backlog of orders as the EV supply chains in the US remain under-developed.\n\n\u201cThe US EV industry is facing challenges in building a more efficient and affordable supply chain,\u201d said Peng. \u201cWe have trouble meeting orders partly because our suppliers are slow in making deliveries.\u201d\n\nPavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates, said the US electric bus industry, while growing fast, was \u201ctoo small to produce on a scale\u201d that allows a well-established supply chain to emerge.\n\nMolchanov added that it would take at least five years for the US electric bus market to become \u201cmeaningful\u201d.\n\nYet Peng could barely afford to wait for that long. Shares of Phoenix have traded at less than $1 \u2014 a threshold that could trigger delisting by Nasdaq \u2014 most of the time since he bought Proterra in 2023.\n\nThe best solution is to work with Chinese suppliers that enjoy cost and quality advantages over their US counterparts.\n\nPeng said Phoenix two years ago launched, without government subsidy, an electric shuttle bus aimed at commercial clients that cost 65 per cent less than its previous model by outsourcing parts to China.\n\nYet the Buy America requirement for government-subsidised electric transit buses, a major source of revenue for Phoenix, has made it difficult for Peng to replicate his cost-cutting magic.\n\nHe said he did not use Chinese-made batteries, known for their low price and high efficiency, for products with federal subsidy as they accounted for at least 30 per cent of the costs of components needed to make a bus.\n\nDespite the challenge, Peng is still keen to tap Chinese suppliers when possible. He said he was considering building electric bus or parts factories in China where production costs were less than half of the level in the US.\n\nThe new factories, according to Peng, would serve markets outside the US under an American brand and technology, which customers were willing to pay a premium for.\n\nPeng added that his future car parts factories in China would \u201ccertainly consider\u201d serving the US market if policy allowed.\n\nMolchanov of Raymond James said outsourcing to China \u201cmakes a lot of sense from an economic perspective\u201d, but could be \u201cpolitically controversial\u201d.\n\nHe went on to warn that Trump\u2019s pledge to revoke electric vehicle support might create \u201cadditional headwind\u201d for electric buses that could become out of reach for buyers without government subsidy.\n\nPeng has pinned his hopes on environmentally conscious states such as California that will ban sales of gas-powered cars by 2035.\n\n\u201cAs long as we can survive until then,\u201d he said, \u201cour company will definitely grow into a big one.\u201d", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/775744e5-5fc9-4d7e-a117-ff37de65ff65"}, {"title": "Fuchsia Dunlop\u2019s culinary guide to Lunar New Year", "description": "The writer, cook and Chinese-food champion gets ready to greet the Year of the Snake. Plus, FT correspondents reveal how their cities will mark the occasion", "author": "Fuchsia Dunlop", "published_date": "2025-01-24T00:00:56.080Z", "content": "A couple of days before the Chinese New Year of 2004, my friend Fan Qun, her husband and I travelled by bus, minibus, boat and, finally, foot, to her family\u2019s remote village in the hills of Hunan province; her two brothers, migrant workers in Guangzhou, had also returned for the festival. On New Year\u2019s Eve, we rounded up a rooster from the paddy fields outside and her father dispatched it quickly with a cleaver, while the meat of a fattened pig that had already been slaughtered was smoked above the kitchen fire. Fan Qun\u2019s father made offerings to his ancestors at a domestic altar laid with the pig\u2019s head, a whole smoked fish and a block of tofu, as well as enamelled mugs of rice wine and homegrown tea.\n\nAll day, Fan Qun\u2019s mother and sister-in-law laboured in the kitchen. A chicken stew hung in a blackened cauldron over the fire; another pot filled with dried radishes sat in the embers. Steam billowed from the woks as the two women sizzled meats and vegetables on an old-fashioned, wood-fired range. Mid-afternoon, they brought out the feast: sweet, golden fritters of glutinous rice, home-cured bacon and carp, Cantonese roast duck brought home by the brothers, a magnificent rooster soup with medicinal herbs, dried squid with jujubes, smoked pork intestines, dishes of tofu and homegrown vegetables and a potful of rice with sweet potatoes. The young nieces, dressed in festive scarlet and pink, sang a song. Then we drank toasts of grain liquor and Coca-Cola and ate. At midnight, we all went outside to light firecrackers that snapped, sputtered and echoed up and down the valley.\n\nThe New Year\u2019s Eve reunion dinner (tuan nian fan) is at the heart of Lunar New Year celebrations all over the world. Traditionally, family members return to their ancestral homes for a sumptuous banquet of home-cooked dishes, followed by a week or two of idling and visiting relatives and friends. In rural areas of China, home-reared pork is often served, along with chicken and a whole fish, the latter because the phrase \u201ca fish every year\u201d (nian nian you yu) sounds the same as \u201ca surplus every year\u201d. But as the Chinese world is on a scale to rival Christendom, local festive food customs vary as much as global Christmas dinners. In the wheat-eating north of China, people traditionally prepare jiaozi dumplings, while the Sichuanese steam fat slices of pork belly in clay bowls packed with salted vegetables. In many parts of the country, families gather around bubbling hotpots packed with meatballs, quail eggs, chunks of pork belly and other delicacies.\n\nWhile the symbolic whole fish is almost ubiquitous on the Chinese festive table, the Cantonese are particularly playful with the auspicious meanings of their New Year dishes (the Chinese language is replete with homonyms and therefore ripe for punning). Slabs of New Year Cake, a sweet pudding made from glutinous rice, are eaten over the holidays because their name, nian gao, plays on another word with the same sound (gao): \u201chigher\u201d \u2014 in wealth, school grades, status or stature. In advance of the festivities, people gift each other coupons that can be redeemed at specific restaurants or shops for this and other seasonal cakes, also known as gao, made from radish and taro (\u201cradish cake futures,\u201d my Cantonese friend Roberta quips). Kumquats and mandarins are served because their golden colour invites prosperity, along with ruddy deep-fried chickens \u2014 red being the traditional colour of Chinese celebrations.\n\nIn Hong Kong and other centres of Cantonese society, restaurants create menus of lucky-number eight dishes, each one with a name that signifies luck, wealth or one of the other bonuses of life. \u201cSo many people dine out around the New Year that we have to offer set menus because the kitchen cannot cope with \u00e0 la carte,\u201d says Lau Kin-wai, veteran food columnist and proprietor of Kin\u2019s Kitchen in the Wanchai district. His restaurant is offering two set menus this year, priced per table at figures in Hong Kong dollars involving lots of auspicious \u201c8\u201ds: the pricier \u201cFour Seasons of Prosperity\u201d menu, for example, costs HK$9,888 ($1,270/\u00a31,030) for a table of 12. Every dish has a poetic name imbued with optimistic meanings, seasonal symbolism or punning words, from \u201cMake a Fortune, Increase Wealth and Honour\u201d (a dish made with hair moss \u2014 facai, which sounds the same as \u201cmake a fortune\u201d \u2014 and \u201cgolden coin\u201d dried scallops) to \u201cGolden Dragon Welcomes the New Year\u201d (tiger shrimps in cheese sauce with egg noodles) and \u201cDancing Phoenix Augments the Joyful Occasion\u201d (deep-fried chicken).\n\n\u201cWhen I was small,\u201d says Lau, \u201cpeople didn\u2019t have much money and cooked more themselves, so the New Year\u2019s Eve dinner normally took place at home. We would stock up on seasonal foods like cured pork and dried oysters [their name a pun on \u2018good business\u2019], as well as lucky sweets and seeds to offer visitors. On the first day of the New Year, we would eat a vegetarian meal because the markets were closed.\n\n\u201cThese days,\u201d he adds, \u201cmore and more Hongkongers have their celebratory meal in restaurants. And in the past few years, they\u2019ve been increasingly popping over to Shenzhen on the mainland, where they can eat lavishly for half the price, or seizing the chance to fly off on a foreign holiday.\u201d\n\nCantonese food customs have spilled over into diaspora communities. Chinese restaurants all over the world offer New Year cakes and symbolic menus. In recent years, an auspicious Malaysian and Singaporean dish has become wildly popular in Chinese circles all over the world: yu sheng, or \u201cprosperity toss\u201d. A colourful assembly of shredded ingredients, including raw fish, are bathed in a sweet dressing, then everyone around the table tosses the food together with their chopsticks while voicing good wishes for the year ahead \u2014 and the higher the ingredients fly above the table, the \u201chigher\u201d the luck. This year, far from China, that New Year with Fan Qun\u2019s family a distant memory, I\u2019ll be celebrating over a home-cooked Shanghainese feast in London \u2014 and I\u2019m looking forward to tossing the prosperity salad while welcoming the Year of the Snake.\n\nFuchsia Dunlop is the author of \u201cInvitation to a Banquet: The Story of Chinese Food\u201d, Fortnum & Mason Food Book of 2024\n\nWherever you are in the world, how do you celebrate the Lunar New Year?

Trump announced immediate 25 per cent tariffs on Colombian imports, rising to 50 per cent in a week, banking sanctions and a US travel ban for Colombian government officials and their allies.\u00a0Petro initially vowed retaliatory tariffs but quickly folded. He had little choice. For Colombia, a trade war with its biggest trading partner would have been devastating.\n\nDenmark and Panama will have been watching closely. Both are small nations in Trump\u2019s sights because they possess valuable territorial assets he covets. In Denmark\u2019s case, it is the strategic Arctic territory of Greenland and in Panama\u2019s, the shipping canal built by America over a century ago.\n\nMexico and Canada, US neighbours and big trading partners, are waiting to discover whether Trump will fulfil a threat to impose 25 per cent tariffs as soon as Saturday, tearing up three decades of North American free trade.\n\nRepublicans may be celebrating Trump\u2019s quick win over a comparatively weak South American president, who had apparently not thought through his impulsive decision. (Colombia had been accepting US military flights deporting its nationals since well before Trump\u2019s inauguration). But the long-term consequences of punishing and publicly humiliating an erstwhile ally are unlikely to favour the US.\n\nWashington has long portrayed itself as a reliable trade and security partner because it can be trusted to stick to international agreements and follow rules. In the Trump era, this no longer appears to be a given. While America has a right to detain and deport migrants who enter illegally \u2014 and Trump has an electoral mandate for that \u2014 anti-US sentiment around the world is likely to be stoked by a return to the bullying tactics of a bygone era.\n\nThere is a potential opening here for the EU to provide an alternative to America First, by stepping up its own investment in the region and ratifying a long-stalled trade pact with South American nations. But China and Russia will be looking for opportunities.\n\nBeijing has touted itself to developing nations as a trusted long-term partner interested in trade and investment rather than playing politics. The experience of some African and Latin American nations has sometimes shown otherwise, but compared with Trump\u2019s unpredictable tactics, Beijing may start to look more attractive.\n\nBy choosing in his first week to make threats against Colombia, Panama and Mexico, some of the closest US allies in the Americas, Trump has signalled a shift away from the soft power approach the US has favoured in recent decades to a harder form of power. While that may \u2014 as it did with Colombia \u2014 deliver short-term results, in the longer term it is just as likely to drive countries away from America. Since Beijing has already demonstrated its willingness to invest heavily in the region, the big winner from Trump\u2019s policies may ultimately not be the US, but China.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d771ef44-a167-40f7-b301-dfbdcf968401"}, {"title": "DeepSeek defies America\u2019s AI supremacy", "description": "A Chinese advance tests the assumptions behind lofty US tech valuations", "author": "The editorial board", "published_date": "2025-01-27T18:20:36.340Z", "content": "America\u2019s superinflated tech stocks had seemed due for a correction for months, but the trigger has come from an unexpected source. The latest large language model from China\u2019s artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek may not be quite a \u201cSputnik moment\u201d. There are parallels, even so, with the early space race, when ingenuity helped Soviet engineers keep pace with and sometimes surpass US rivals, despite their relative lack of computing power and cutting-edge technologies. The US went on to win the Moon race, and establish a sustainable edge in space. But DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough upturns the assumptions that have underpinned US tech valuations, of an unassailable supremacy in AI that would be extended by spending billions of dollars on chips and infrastructure.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s achievement is to have developed an LLM that AI experts say achieves a performance similar to US rivals OpenAI and Meta but claims to use far fewer \u2014 and less advanced \u2014 Nvidia chips, and to have been trained for a fraction of the cost. Some of its assertions remain to be verified. If they are true, however, it represents a potentially formidable competitor.\n\nFirst, like Meta of the US but unlike OpenAI or Google\u2019s Gemini, it is open source \u2014 ready to share the recipe for its secret sauce rather than keep it locked away in hope of extracting maximum financial gain. That makes it appealing for developers to use and build on. Second, it can be put together on much more of a shoestring budget and with much less computing power. This explains Monday\u2019s plunging stock prices not just of front-line tech companies but of those that make chip equipment and supply electrical hardware for data centres.\n\nThe big US companies are focused on a particular model of scaling AI by throwing vast amounts of capital, data and computing power at the problem. First Mistral, a French AI start-up, and now DeepSeek have demonstrated that companies with fewer resources may end up with smarter and more efficient models. The increasing efficiency of these models is also likely to spur increased demand for their use.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s advance highlights, too, that China is managing to make technological leaps in AI despite export controls introduced by the Biden administration intended to deprive it of both the most powerful chips and the advanced tools needed to make them. Chinese AI start-ups have been compelled to find inventive ways of extracting the most juice from the chips they do have. Far from stifling Chinese innovation, Washington may have stimulated it. And the success of often domestically trained Chinese engineers in increasing efficiency and finding workarounds raises questions over whether the technological \u201cmoat\u201d established by high-spending US groups such as Meta, Google, OpenAI and Anthropic is as wide and impregnable as they had thought.\n\nMany advanced democracies will be wary of a Chinese government seen in many ways as inimical to western interests potentially acquiring leadership in the most transformative technology of our era. Yet some political leaders elsewhere, along with many consumers and developers, may welcome a market that is less dominated by a handful of American companies.\n\nThe open question now is not necessarily who will develop the best AI models but who can apply them best to real-world tasks. Kai-Fu Lee, a Chinese AI pioneer, has long argued that China excels on the application front even if it may lag behind in infrastructure. That was before the Chinese start-up world was squeezed by the political clampdown on tech entrepreneurs and the surge of investment in US AI start-ups. But after DeepSeek\u2019s achievement, it looks a much more even game.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/cd1a6482-37e4-475b-8ef6-59d0340fcc41"}, {"title": "Trump gives Chinese equities a breather", "description": "If the US president takes a more flexible approach, tariffs may end up being used as a bargaining tool rather than end goal", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-01-24T11:55:47.851Z", "content": "When US presidents opine on China, it is rarely good news for investors in Chinese equities. At least in recent years, announcements have tended to mark punitive measures such as blacklists, export restrictions and tariffs.\n\nThat trend was bucked on Friday. Chinese stocks rose after Donald Trump remarked on a \u201cfriendly\u201d conversation with Xi Jinping and hinted at a potentially softer approach toward tariffs. The diplomatic cordiality between geopolitical rivals may not guarantee lasting progress on trade talks. Yet for local stocks, it arrives at a perfect time.\n\nBlue-chips such as Tencent, Alibaba and JD.com gained 3 per cent on Friday, as did Hong Kong\u2019s benchmark index which is particularly sensitive to geopolitical tensions. The Hang Seng rose about 2 per cent, bringing gains to 6 per cent since last week. That suggests relief that Trump says he would rather not have to use tariffs against on Chinese goods \u2014 a big question hanging over valuations for the past year.\n\nChina\u2019s exports to the US account for about 4 per cent of its GDP. In the short term, tariffs drive up costs for Chinese exporters and squeeze margins. Their long-term effects, such as weakening the renminbi and inflating risk premium for Chinese stocks, raise concerns about capital flight. If Trump is taking a more flexible approach, these measures may end up being used as a bargaining tool with China rather than an end goal.\n\nThat in turn allows investors to consider other factors that could support Chinese stocks in future. Beijing is trying to improve shareholder returns. Large-scale stimulus measures and plans to inject around Rmb1tn ($138bn) in long-term capital into the financial system ought to improve sentiment.\n\nChinese companies paid out a record Rmb2.4tn in dividends last year while share buybacks also hit an all-time high, according to official data. This push has particularly benefited high-dividend stocks, such as banks, insurers and utilities. Meanwhile, regulators have been directing insurers and mutual funds to increase local stock holdings \u2014 which could draw more capital into the country\u2019s markets.\n\nValuations remain relatively low, with China\u2019s blue-chip CSI 300 Index trading at around 1.3 times book value. By contrast, the S&P 500 stands at around four times that level.\n\nThe reliance of local exporters\u2019 earnings on geopolitical dynamics means their share prices will remain highly sensitive to unfolding developments in the coming months. But for now, there is enough good news \u2014 both real and rhetorical \u2014 to support short-term gains.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/152b9d13-69cc-47e7-af09-354da951e16d"}, {"title": "When peak Chinese oil demand meets \u2018drill, baby, drill\u2019", "description": "Trump\u2019s slogan is a bet on the energy status quo, not on the future", "author": "The editorial board", "published_date": "2025-01-23T18:54:28.492Z", "content": "What happens when the world\u2019s largest oil producer goes all-out to boost production just as the appetite of the world\u2019s largest oil importer may be peaking? Demand from China \u2014 which has accounted for half of all world oil demand growth over three decades \u2014 shows signs of levelling off thanks to slowing economic expansion and an epochal shift to green power and electric vehicles. Returning US President Donald Trump has, meanwhile, declared a national energy emergency intended to boost fossil fuel output, and begun to reverse the Biden administration\u2019s green agenda. In theory, these dynamics might lead to an oil glut and falling prices. The reality is more complex.\n\nThe US-China divergence is at root about competing visions of energy security. Beijing\u2019s embrace of renewable energy reflects less a noble conversion to saving the planet, and more a strategic determination to reduce dependence on imported oil. Conversely, alongside the popularity of his \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d mantra among consumers balking at the costs of the green transition, Trump does not want the US to rely on a green energy supply chain dominated by China.\n\nTrump\u2019s Treasury secretary pick, Scott Bessent, suggests America can produce an additional 3mn barrels of oil-equivalent a day by 2028. There may be scope, in time, to lift output of natural gas, which the president is eager to export to Europe. For all the rhetoric and deregulation, however, US oil production \u2014 which at 13mn b/d is already a record for any country \u2014 will be much harder to raise. Producers are unlikely to boost drilling a lot at current US benchmark prices of about $75 a barrel; a recent survey found oil groups needed a $65 price for drilling to be profitable, and $89 to justify a substantial increase.\n\nAt the same time, exports from some other suppliers may fall \u2014 thanks to US actions. The departing Biden administration this month imposed stiff new sanctions on Russian oil, which by some estimates could remove up to 2mn b/d from the market. The new US president threatened this week to go further unless Vladimir Putin strikes a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Tougher US moves to restrict Iranian exports, in line with Trump\u2019s first-term approach, could take hundreds of thousands of barrels a day more off the market.\n\nThis would open a potential opportunity for the world\u2019s swing producer \u2014 Saudi Arabia; the Opec consortium has for months been holding back planned production increases, to balance the market with Chinese demand drooping. Trump\u2019s programme could then lead ironically to Saudi Aramco, more than US oil companies, opening the spigots. (Addressing the World Economic Forum on Thursday, the US president explicitly called on Opec to push down global oil prices.) For Trump, this could create leeway to pursue his geopolitical goals without pushing up prices at the pump. Even if US oil producers do not end up raising their own output by much, they will be happy to see Trump acting to stimulate demand, for example by cutting incentives to switch to EVs.\n\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d slogan seems aimed at giving confidence to oil and gas producers, not just in America but in much of the world. It symbolises his intention to remove the regulatory controls and environmental, social and governance investment principles that have constrained the industry in recent years, and his repudiation of efforts to curb climate change.\n\nIt is hard to see how those efforts can succeed without a vast global shift to electric power from green sources. Though it is still burning a lot of coal, China\u2019s green energy shift looks, then, like a bet on the future, while the US is betting on the status quo. There may be hard-nosed reasons for Trump\u2019s America to make that choice. But the consequences may be that the US is left on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of history \u2014 and the existential battle to contain global warming is dealt a severe blow.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4581f40a-aeb5-4be0-a218-b853082fbbff"}, {"title": "China is stealing the scene in Japan\u2019s TV market ", "description": "Underestimating the ingenuity of Chinese competitors has proven unwise", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.603Z", "content": "There was a time when nearly every hotel room seemed to have a TV with a Sony, Panasonic, Samsung or LG logo on the bottom of the screen. Affordable Chinese models have long been chipping away at the dominance of such Japanese and South Korean brands. Now, however, China\u2019s ascent is about more than just price.\n\nTake what\u2019s happening in Japan. Local brands are increasingly being displaced by Chinese manufacturers on their home turf. Chinese makers accounted for more than half of all flat-screen TVs sold in Japan last year for the first time on record, according to research firm BCN.\n\nIn the past, Chinese companies have disrupted industries primarily through cheapness. That meant even as they gained market share, a clear distinction remained between premium and budget segments. The high-end market, which typically has fatter margins, still provided a lucrative buffer for incumbent players to sustain their business as Chinese makers focused on affordability. That may now be changing.\n\nTV makers aiming to capture the premium segment typically differentiate themselves in two ways: advancements in display technology and the integration of artificial intelligence features. Chinese electronics groups including Hisense, TCL and Xiaomi have been quick to integrate the latest AI features into their TVs to enhance picture clarity, contrast and colour based on real-time scene detection, as well as suggest content based on user preferences. They also offer seamless integration with global smart TV platforms and streaming services.\n\nPremium TVs using Oled technology, which enables ultra-slim display panels and vivid colours, were once the exclusive domain of Japanese and South Korean makers. These TVs offered higher profit margins compared with traditional LCD TVs, offsetting weakness in the lower-end market. Yet over the past five years, Chinese makers led by Xiaomi, TCL and Hisense have been aggressively expanding their offerings here, as their investments in display innovation begin to pay off.\n\nShares of Xiaomi have more than doubled in the past six months, while TCL Electronics stock has nearly tripled in the past year. Even after those gains, TCL trades at just below 12 times forward earnings \u2014 a steep discount to Japanese peers. That would be justifiable if Chinese TV makers weren\u2019t moving upmarket.\n\nUnderestimating the ingenuity of Chinese competitors has proven unwise: look no further than DeepSeek\u2019s dramatic arrival in the AI arms race. Investors in Japanese electronics groups used to regarding China as no more than a supporting actor should be on guard.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/94af18db-0ae4-46f8-acc8-7107445d451b"}, {"title": "Liang Wenfeng, the DeepSeek founder panicking the tech world", "description": "The hedge fund quant turned start-up leader rose from a rural Chinese village to overturn America\u2019s AI monopoly ", "author": "Eleanor Olcott", "published_date": "2025-01-31T14:06:14.375Z", "content": "In China, Liang Wenfeng is being celebrated as a hero this week, a digital David fighting America\u2019s Big Tech Goliath, armed with a modest cluster of artificial intelligence chips and a small crack team of engineers.\n\nHis computational projectile was a series of papers released by his AI start-up DeepSeek, which appeared to show that it was possible to build powerful large language models with far fewer Nvidia chips than US rivals. Global investors wiped\u2009almost $600bn off Nvidia\u2019s market capitalisation as a result, questioning whether pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into gargantuan AI computing clusters was necessary.\n\nThese concerns were all far from the minds of Mililing villagers, a small community in the southern province of Guangdong where Liang grew up and where the 40-year-old billionaire returned home for the Lunar New Year holiday, flanked by security guards.\u00a0Mililing is so small that there appears to have hitherto been nothing written about it online in English.\n\nThe reception was jubilant. \u201cLiang Wenfeng returns to his hometown to spread good results and add energy to rural revitalisation,\u201d wrote one banner adorning an inflatable red arch.\n\nLiang\u2019s family home has become an unlikely pilgrimage site for those interested in seeing where this reluctant celebrity was raised. But while his neighbours praised his achievements, none could say much about the current life of the mysterious man who has sparked an existential panic in Silicon Valley.\u00a0DeepSeek and Liang did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLocals say Liang comes from a family of educators. His parents and grandfather were all teachers.\n\n\u201cHis parents are good people. He left the village for school at a young age,\u201d says one neighbour also surnamed Liang but not related. Mililing, he says, is a village \u201cof a thousand Liangs\u201d.\n\nAt the middle school in the nearby town, one of his teachers says Liang stood out in the 50-student class as \u201cwell behaved and mild mannered\u201d. \u201cHe was a top student, especially in maths. He liked reading comic books,\u201d he adds.\n\nLiang left high school in 2002 and went to Zhejiang University to complete an undergraduate degree and a masters in computer science, where he penned a thesis about motion detection algorithms. After graduating in 2010, he parlayed his computing skills into automated stock trading, first as a freelancer then at his own hedge fund High-Flyer in 2015.\n\nHigh-Flyer has grown to become one of China\u2019s top four quant funds, using algorithms to execute trades. After building a fortune in trading, Liang pivoted into generative AI, utilising both talent and computing resources from High-Flyer to launch DeepSeek in 2023.\n\nOne manager at a rival fund who has known Liang for years says: \u201cHe stands out from our crowd because he\u2019s a true engineer. He thinks and acts like one. While we\u2019re managing people and funds, he is coding every day.\u201d\n\nLiang\u2019s stated goal with DeepSeek is to pursue artificial general intelligence, a holy grail that OpenAI is also working towards, which will herald a time when computers are capable of humanlike critical thinking. The fund manager says Liang will finally \u201cbe able to entirely remove the human factor\u201d by achieving AGI.\n\nLiang\u2019s fellow quants are happy to see him find success with DeepSeek. \u201cI hope this will mean Beijing will be more friendly to us,\u201d says another trader.\n\nWhile quants are revered in the west as financial geniuses of the digital age, they have been vilified in China. During stock market routs, regulators have limited their activity, accusing quants of profiting at the expense of the country\u2019s roughly 200mn retail investors. The wider finance industry has also experienced a number of rocky years, with officials capping pay at state-owned funds and criticising the sector for not contributing to societal development.\n\nBeijing has a more positive attitude towards AI companies and has recognised Liang\u2019s contributions at DeepSeek. Before the holiday, he was selected as the only AI leader to join a publicised meeting with China\u2019s second-in-command, Li Qiang. Along with a small group of entrepreneurs, he was exhorted to make technological breakthroughs for the country.\n\nIn public, Liang has remained silent, even as he has become a focal point in US-China tensions, with some US lawmakers reacting to DeepSeek\u2019s progress by suggesting further limits on China\u2019s access to Nvidia chips.\n\nLiang\u2019s silence is true to his character. \u201cFor those who know him well, he can talk a lot when it\u2019s a topic of interest. You need to get used to his communication style. He\u2019s not being rude when he\u2019s suddenly quiet, which often happens. He\u2019s thinking,\u201d says another fund manager.\u00a0\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want to talk to you, he\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek has not responded to attacks from US rivals, which range from accusations of technology theft to claims that the company is being used as an asset of the Chinese state.\n\nThe internet has also been left to hunt for clues about Liang, dissecting the sparse public information available.\n\nBut for residents of Mililing, he represents something more innocent: a hard-working student from a small farming community that made it big. \u201cWe all grew up in this village,\u201d says Leon Liang, who used to play football with the younger Liang. \u201cWe\u2019re very proud of him.\u201d\n\neleanor.olcott@ft.com, zijing.wu@ft.com\n\nAdditional

structured funds had become \u201cincreasingly popular in overseas markets\u201d.\n\nSingle stock leveraged and inverse products have been available in Europe since 2018, with the US following suit in 2022, where they have proved popular with international investors looking to trade or hedge positions in large-cap stocks such as Nvidia and Tesla.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, there has been growing interest among product issuers in launching them in Hong Kong, in the light of their distinct appeal to investors,\u201d said the SFC.\n\nSingle stock leveraged and inverse products use derivatives to deliver multiples of the performance of a single stock\u2019s daily price return, or profit from declines in their value.\n\nDefined outcome listed structured funds use options contracts to protect investors against losses, while capping their potential investment gains.\n\nSingle stock leveraged and inverse products could allow investors to trade or hedge their positions in individual stocks listed overseas and provide price discovery tools for overseas exposure during Asian trading hours, continued the regulator.\n\nChristina Choi, the SFC\u2019s executive director of investment products, said the circular provided a \u201cclear pathway for those seeking product authorisation\u201d, while also spelling out the regulator\u2019s expectation for products to meet robust regulatory standards.\n\nFor single-stock leveraged and inverse products, the SFC said it would only accept those tracking a \u201chighly liquid megacap stock listed on a major overseas exchange\u201d, excluding overseas stocks with a dual listing in Hong Kong, and stocks listed on any mainland exchange.\n\nThe maximum leverage of these products will be capped at a factor of 2x, or -2x.\n\nJean-Francois Mesnard-Sense, head of exchange traded products at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said Hong Kong had become the first market in Asia to offer single stock leveraged and inverse products.\n\n\u201cThis will further enhance our product ecosystem, reinforcing Hong Kong\u2019s role as a leading ETP marketplace in Asia,\u201d said Mesnard-Sense, adding that HKEX would work with issuers and stakeholders towards introducing the new products.\n\nSally Wong, chief executive of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association, said she welcomed greater flexibility to allow more innovation in product offering as a general principle.\n\nBut she also noted that the complexity and risk profile of these types of products would mean they would only be catering to a \u201cvery niche market segment\u201d.\n\nHong Kong allowed the first leveraged and inverse products in 2016, initially limited to products tracking liquid and broadly based \u201cnon-Hong Kong, non-mainland foreign equity indexes\u201d.\n\nProducts tracking Hong Kong\u2019s stock market were added in 2017 and the product universe was extended to China\u2019s onshore stock markets in 2020.\n\nBosera Asset Management, China Asset Management (HK), CSOP Asset Management and Fubon Fund Management have launched a total of 19 leveraged and inverse products in Hong Kong so far, tracking equities indexes and commodities including cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn the circular, the SFC said the new product types would have to meet existing rules for listed structured funds and ETFs, in addition to some other requirements for leveraged and inverse products around their naming and other aspects.\n\nThe SFC does not allow leveraged and inverse products to be named \u201cETFs\u201d in order to differentiate them from conventional ETFs. The products are also required to include the leverage or inverse factor and the word \u201cdaily\u201d in the name, to emphasise their daily rebalancing feature.\n\nIssuers were also expected to conduct \u201cextensive investor education before launching the funds in Hong Kong\u201d, said the regulator.\n\nThe SFC might consider introducing further requirements applicable to specific types of listed structured funds as necessary, according to the circular.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

It suited both sides to identify the differentiator as a patient, distinctly Japanese, betterment of product and process.\n\nThe practical effects of kaizen were remarkable: they were among the prime reasons that Japan\u2019s economy became huge in the 1970s and 80s, and why so many of its companies retain global competitiveness in a formidable range of manufacturing fields.\n\nBut kaizen\u2019s evolution during Japan\u2019s long, stagnant post-bubble decades is perhaps more extraordinary. Once the era of financial excess evaporated, kaizen became a survival superpower: a simultaneous propellant of higher quality and leanness in corrosive times. Deflation, and the inability of Japanese manufacturers to secure pricing power in their domestic market, made cost-cutting a fine art.\n\nChinese manufacturers, with their attention long fixed on cost and technology, have been closely scrutinising all this, and have seen ways to make kaizen their own. DeepSeek may represent a software breakthrough, but it is one borne on the shoulders of a now relentlessly, incrementally advancing hardware sector.\n\nMany will argue that China\u2019s acquisition of technology has been opportunist at best and underhanded at worst. Where outright theft or coercion is not blamed (and it is, frequently), foreign companies have lost key technology to badly formulated transfer deals or excessive optimism over the ability to protect IP. But that has long ceased to explain everything.\n\nIn China\u2019s most recent and visible industrial achievements \u2014 the production of low-cost, competitive quality electric cars, consumer electronics, industrial machinery, high speed trains and robots \u2014 some version of kaizen is now at work. And there are reasons to suspect that the Chinese iteration may, for a stint, work faster, more disruptively and with more visible results, than the original.\n\nFirst, China has the numbers and talent to throw at kaizen on a much larger scale than Japan ever mustered. Increments work best when there are a lot of them.\n\nSecond, it is happening in an era where consumers are far quicker to identify and communicate when a product is not exactly as they would like it.\n\nBut a third is that they may be able to pay for speed. As well as directly observing kaizen in action at Japanese manufacturing operations, Chinese companies, according to recruitment agents in Tokyo, have found they can lure away Japanese semiconductor, railway and robotics engineers as consultants. This is not new, say the agents, but it is now sharply accelerating.\n\nJapanese companies tend to retire highly qualified people early, have not, for some years during the deflationary period, paid them especially handsomely and have instilled less parting loyalty than they might have hoped. They can be paid well by a Chinese company and, without explicitly imparting industrial secrets, their worth is immense: kaizen is fundamentally a process of trial and error, and an experienced engineer can impart the invaluable, cost-saving nod on what was tried but didn\u2019t work.\n\nAdvice such as: forget the pencil, it was useless.\n\nleo.lewis@ft.com", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f5bbb712-ac6d-4c0f-9136-e4304461d905"}, {"title": "German companies are risking a \u2018lose-lose\u2019 decoupling with China ", "description": "The corporate and political winds appear to be blowing increasingly in that direction", "author": "Richard Milne", "published_date": "2025-01-30T00:01:10.008Z", "content": "Decoupling can be painful. Germany found that out the hard way after weaning itself off its dependence on cheap Russian gas following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNow German companies from Volkswagen and BMW to BASF and Mercedes-Benz are facing what could be a stiffer challenge: a potential scaling back of ties with China, once one of the main sources of their profits. The corporate and political winds appear to be blowing increasingly in that direction.\n\nFriedrich Merz, the frontrunner to become German chancellor in elections next month, warned companies that China was part of an \u201caxis of autocracies\u201d and that investing there involved \u201cgreat risk\u201d. \u201cMy heartfelt request to all companies\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Limit the risk you take in order to avoid endangering your own company if it triggers an immediate write-off,\u201d he said last week.\n\nThat appears to mark a change from the rhetoric of current chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has vaguely talked of \u201cde-risking\u201d from China but also lobbied for better market access for German companies on a trip last year to Beijing together with business leaders. There is also pressure from the US, increasing with Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, for Germany to choose a side between Washington and Beijing.\n\nFor big German companies, this might all be beside the point. A decision on China ties may not be entirely in their hands to take.\n\nThe potential from China\u2019s huge population and its rising middle class enticed German carmakers and metal bashing industrial companies to expand in the country, overriding any worries about geopolitical tensions or human rights concerns.\n\nBut long-standing correlation between Chinese economic growth and German exports to China has broken down since the Covid-19 pandemic. German exports to China increased faster than to any other major trading partner from 2015-20 but have fallen back since.\n\nGerman companies, particularly the carmakers, face huge market pressure in China. For years derided as producing cheap, clunky cars, Chinese manufacturers \u2014 admittedly heavily supported by the state \u2014 have shot past their German counterparts in developing electric vehicles.\n\nGerman carmakers\u2019 EV market share in China was just 4 per cent in 2024, the lowest of any country, according to the German Association of the Automotive Industry. This matters as EV sales in China are more than double those in Europe, US, Canada, Japan and South Korea combined.\n\nOne non-German automotive boss thinks that German manufacturers need to give up on China, an especially difficult thing given how lucrative the market has been for them in the past. \u201cTheir share is pretty much going to zero. It will be painful,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe issue is how painful and fast the process will be. VW delivered 4.2mn cars in China in 2019, making \u20ac4.4bn in operating profit. By 2023, those figures were down to 3.2mn deliveries and \u20ac2.6bn in operating profit.\n\nOverall, sales of foreign brands in China have fallen to a record low of less than 40 per cent market share, down from more than 60 per cent in 2020, according to data from Shanghai consultancy Automobility. China still represents between a quarter and almost half of sales for VW, BMW and Mercedes suggesting more suffering could come.\n\nGerman carmakers are keen to protect what they have, however, leading to some strange developments. Analysts estimate German groups such as VW may have to fork out hundreds of millions of euros to Chinese rivals to buy carbon credits to meet new EU pollution rules for this year.\n\nThen there is the spectacle of BMW and Mercedes joining Chinese manufacturers in suing the EU over tariffs on EVs from China. Ola K\u00e4llenius, chief executive of Mercedes, also told the FT this month that the EU should instead try to encourage Chinese carmakers to open more plants in Europe.\n\nGerman carmakers are also pushing back against an EU ban on the sale of new fossil-fuel cars from 2035. All of which raises the question of whether German reluctance to decouple from an autocracy is driving EU policy in an unwanted direction.\n\n\u201cGerman dependency on Russian gas slowed the transition to renewable energy. I\u2019m worried now they are slowing our transition to EVs,\u201d says one European industrial boss.\n\nHow this German de-risking or decoupling plays out will be one of the main European corporate stories of the coming years. Can its companies avoid a lose-lose situation, where they find themselves squeezed out of the Chinese market and/or outcompeted by Chinese rivals at home?\n\nrichard.milne@ft.com", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f61d6b7b-0250-4edf-aac1-ba0ca18545cd"}, {"title": "The baby gap: why governments can\u2019t pay their way to higher birth rates", "description": "Governments offer a catalogue of creative incentives for childbearing \u2014 yet fertility rates just keep dropping", "author": "Janina Conboye", "published_date": "2025-01-29T05:00:47.734Z", "content": "Politicians in Lestij\u00e4rvi thought they had the answer to Finland\u2019s demographic woes: each mother of a newborn baby would receive \u20ac1,000 a year for 10 years if they stayed in the Nordic country\u2019s second-smallest municipality.\n\nBut more than a decade after they introduced the payments, and over \u20ac400,000 poorer, officials were forced to concede defeat: Lestij\u00e4rvi\u2019s population has shrunk by a fifth since the scheme started.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t worth doing at all,\u201d said Niko Aihio, the town\u2019s former head of education. \u201cThe baby boom only lasted one year.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers around the world are grappling with the same problems as those in Lestij\u00e4rvi: no matter what they seem to offer in the way of incentives, people are not having more babies. For the Finnish municipality it failed even to lure people from elsewhere: \u201cIt didn\u2019t stop people moving away, and it didn\u2019t attract new families,\u201d Aihio said.\n\nChina has offered free fertility treatments, Hungary big tax exemptions and cash, and Singapore grants for parents and grandparents. A Danish travel company even ran an ad campaign to \u201cDo it for Denmark\u201d. In Japan, the state funds AI-powered matchmaking, while Tokyo\u2019s metropolitan government is offering a four-day working week to staff in an attempt to encourage people to become parents.\n\nGovernments are still hunting for policy options to counter a looming economic crisis as older populations expand and the pool of workers shrinks. It is a shift that think-tank the Robert Schuman Foundation has called \u201cdemographic suicide\u201d.\n\nThe reasons for the trend have been fiercely debated, while some potential solutions, such as immigration and pushing people to retire later, have proved deeply politically unpalatable.\n\n\u201cThe issue of population ageing presents multiple challenges for Europe,\u201d said Olli Rehn, governor of the Finnish central bank. \u201cFirst, the worsening dependency ratio is putting significant pressure on public finances. Second, an ageing society tends to be less economically dynamic and less entrepreneurial.\u201d\n\nThe decline in birth rates is a peculiarly universal problem \u2014 no continent has been left unscathed by the trend. Two-thirds of the world\u2019s population now lives in countries where people are having babies at a rate too low to replace their population.\n\nMore and more countries are joining the list. By 2100, just 12 countries \u2014 11 in Africa and the tiny Pacific island state of Vanuatu \u2014 are expected to have fertility rates above the crucial level of 2.1 births per woman. Not a single country is expected to have a rate above 2.3 by the end of the century.\n\nPolicymakers may be tempted to focus on more immediate crises. But the decline in fertility rates threatens to lead to deep economic malaise. Fewer babies and more older residents lead to a lower proportion of people of working age, denting tax revenues at the same time as costs associated with ageing societies, such as state pensions and healthcare, increase.\n\nWithout sufficient policy action, analysts at rating agency S&P Global estimated in 2023 that fiscal deficits would balloon by 2060 from a global average now of 2.4 per cent of GDP to 9.1 per cent. The global net government debt-to-GDP level would very nearly triple.\n\nMeanwhile, a McKinsey report in January suggested many of the world\u2019s richest economies, such as the UK, US and Japan, would need to at least double productivity growth to maintain historical improvements in living standards amid sharp falls in their birth rates.\n\nParts of Asia, especially China, and Latin American countries are particularly exposed. In 1995, 10 workers in eastern Asia supported one old-age person; by 2085, it is projected to be one to one.\n\nPoliticians worry that they may be powerless to act, as social pressures on women undergo a profound change. Sarah Harper, professor of gerontology and director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, said surveys of young women across the world, from Europe to south-east Asia, suggested a once built-in social obligation for women to reproduce \u2014 and an assumption on their part that if they could, they probably would have children \u2014 no longer existed.\n\nCareers and increased gender equality are a part of that. \u201cWe have a whole cohort of women in high-income countries, but also in south-east Asia, and particularly east Asia\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009who have been educated in a very gender-neutral way,\u201d said Harper. \u201cThey enter the workplace in a gender-neutral way, and then they become parents and suddenly, no matter how hard one tries, it\u2019s not gender-neutral.\u201d\n\nPolicy is also likely to have little effect where norms around the number of children are ingrained. Harper noted that in China, despite the end of the one-child policy in 2016, women still generally had just one child.\n\n\u201cOnce you come to a one-child society, then why would you want to have two children? Because everyone has one child\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009everyone is geared up to having one child. Institutions are geared up to having one child,\u201d Harper said.\n\nHeidi Colleran, an academic at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, said that despite decades of research and thousands of people working on demographic trends, there was little to no consensus on why fertility rates kept declining.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of general threads to pull on: the rise of the nuclear family, changes in the age of marriage, the rate at which people live together, the age at which people start having their first child is getting older and older,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of these individual-level features\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and they\u2019re all correct\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. [But] the same constellation of predictors, they are going to be correlated with each other in a different way in different places.\u201d\n\nYet, while personal choice has played a part in the global decline in childbearing, studies indicate people are often having fewer children than they would like to \u2014 indicating there could still be a role for public policies in changing that.\n\nBarriers such as the cost of childcare and housing, financial instability, persistent gender inequality, inflexible working conditions, and a lack of job security are among the factors holding people back from having more children.\n\nBetter policies may not be able to close the gap completely, but they can help. \u201cSupportive family policies \u2014 such as accessible childcare, financial incentives, and cultural acceptance of working parents \u2014 can significantly impact demographic trends,\u201d Rehn said.\n\nExperts agree. \u201cConventional pro-natal policy that is chucking money at the problem works to an extent,\u201d said Lyman Stone, demographer at the Institute of Family Studies, who specialises in fertility.\n\nStone said studies showed South Korean fertility rates could be even lower than they are now without baby bonus programmes, the expansion of state-funded childcare, subsidised fertility treatments and housing assistance.\n\nAt the same time, Finland remains one of the world\u2019s most rapidly ageing societies thanks to a big baby boom after the second world war. Neither cheap childcare, nor \u201cbaby money\u201d paid out by dozens of municipalities, appear to have had much impact on the country\u2019s birth rate, which remains among Europe\u2019s lowest.\n\nAihio said that good local services \u2014 such as libraries, swimming pools and decent childcare \u2014 seemed more important than money in encouraging women to have babies. And Rehn acknowledged that policies could take a \u201clong time\u201d to show any pay-off.\n\nSome governments have also faced criticism for how they target measures to encourage people to become parents. In Italy, for example \u2014 where the fertility rate stands at a modest 1.2 \u2014 only heterosexual, married women are allowed to undergo in vitro fertilisation, even privately. Single women and those in same-sex partnerships are denied access.\n\nAnother \u201chuge headache for policymakers\u201d, said Paula Sheppard, evolutionary anthropologist at Oxford university, was that different parts of the population needed different policies.\n\nWomen with low levels of education delay having children because of concerns about the stability of their relationships and the need to live near their parents. By contrast, those with a university education worry about dropping down the career ladder and want a hands-on partner, her research has suggested.\n\nOthers studying the challenge of old-age dependency ratios argue there is no need to focus policy changes primarily on births.\n\nEdward Paice, a demographics expert focusing on Africa, said there was an obvious answer to the west\u2019s demographic problems: immigration. \u201cEurope can\u2019t hermetically seal itself anyway. There are tremendous opportunities for western countries to rethink how they engage with African countries,\u201d he said.\n\nAn influx of foreigners has slowly but steadily increased Finland\u2019s population in recent years. But while Rehn acknowledged that work- and education-related immigration was \u201can essential part of the solution\u201d, he added: \u201cOf course, in the age of populism this is a politically challenging message.\u201d\n\nGovernments also want people to work for longer. Harper, the professor of gerontology, said it was important for societies to acknowledge that retiring from the workforce and then expecting to live on social support for decades afterwards was\u2009\u201cjust not sustainable\u201d.\n\nLike immigration, raising the retirement age can come at a steep political cost.\n\nIn France in 2023, people took to the streets in protest as President Emmanuel Macron rammed through legislation to raise the retirement age from 62 to just 64. Many Chinese have reacted angrily to legislation to raise statutory retirement ages, which are some of the world\u2019s lowest.\n\n\u201cYou can either increase migration rates or retirement age, or encourage people to have more children,\u201d said Edward Davies, policy director at the Centre for Social Justice in the UK. \u201cI suspect of the three, people naturally would like to have families, whereas actually telling them they have to retire later or you have to have mass migration \u2014 it\u2019s probably just less popular.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by David Pilling in London\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nHow global demography resembles a Ponzi scheme / From Eric Filseth, Palo Alto, CA, US", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2f4e8e43-ab36-4703-b168-0ab56a0a32bc"}, {"title": "Tech in 2025: China\u2019s AI \u2018Sputnik moment\u2019", "description": "Is China about to catch up with the US in the artificial intelligence race?", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-01-28T17:36:48.395Z", "content": "The Chinese company DeepSeek has shocked the world with an AI model that could rival those built by the biggest artificial intelligence companies in Silicon Valley.

Or at least something interesting about how investors see the global economy today.\n\nLo, the spread between India and China\u2019s 10 year sovereign bond yields hit an 11-year high of 5.2 percentage points earlier this month, and remains near its highest ever levels.\n\nThe recent ballooning is mostly due to Chinese yields grinding lower and lower. Indian yields have actually fallen as well lately, due to expectations for rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of India, the surging US dollar, and last year\u2019s inclusion into JPMorgan\u2019s influential emerging market bond indices.\n\nHowever, the economic outlook for India is lot more positive than it is for China. As a result, the inflation picture is also radically different, as Chetan Ahya, chief Asia economist at Morgan Stanley points out:\n\nTrinh Nguyen, economist for emerging Asia at Natixis, adds that India has some tailwinds that China now lacks:\n\nAs a result, Indian bond yields have remained relatively high \u2014 the 10-year yield has dipped from above 7 per cent in the middle of 2024 to around 6.7 per cent right now \u2014 even as Chinese bond yields have puked hard.\n\nIn fact, the 10-year Chinese government bond yield is now only a whisker above 1.5 per cent, a figurative fixed income market howl that there\u2019s a danger that deflation becomes entrenched.\n\nIn a sign of how serious the situation is for China, its 30-year yield fell below that of Japan\u2019s last year, and China\u2019s 10-year government bond yield is now only 0.4 percentage point higher than that of Japan.\n\nThe United Nations predicts that India will remain the fastest growing major economy in the world, forecasting GDP growth of 6.6 per cent in 2025, even Chinese economic growth slows to 4.8 per cent.\n\nThe whole India versus China thing seems to be becoming a bit of a narrative, with UBS recently releasing a 139-page tome that compares the two countries across a range of different macro and capital market metrics. Most notably, the report predicts that India could overtake China in MSCI\u2019s equity weightings by as early as 2028.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t that long ago that people were just as bullish on China\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ff2fafa8-b285-4d18-9775-1ce039dd26de"}, {"title": "Global hotel chains bet on cheaper end of market as Chinese economy slows", "description": "Hyatt, IHG and Radisson are expanding in China but shifting focus to more cost-conscious travellers", "author": "Tina Hu", "published_date": "2025-01-28T05:00:37.567Z", "content": "International hotel groups are increasing their presence in China, betting on the cheaper end of the market as the country\u2019s economic slowdown hurts travellers\u2019 budgets.\n\nHyatt, IHG and Radisson are among the global hotel chains expanding in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy \u2014 and converting some of the many unoccupied office blocks to hotels \u2014 as they look to target younger, more cost-conscious travellers.\n\nHyatt, the US hospitality group known for upmarket brands such as Grand Hyatt and Hyatt Regency, has about 170 of its more than 1,300 hotels in China.

The group said mid-range hotels were experiencing \u201csubstantial\u201d growth in China as \u201cconsumer behaviours evolve\u201d.\n\nBelgium-based Radisson, which was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Jin Jiang International in 2018, said it was planning about 400 new hotels in China by 2030, including a large number of mid-range rooms.\n\nSome of its new hotels would be converted from office buildings, said Elie Younes, Radisson\u2019s global chief development officer. \u201cPeople in secondary cities are spending less in China, so I have to afford to build the hotel that the customer can afford,\u201d he said.\n\nAverage room rates at luxury and upscale hotels in China were down by up to 20 per cent in October compared with the previous year, said Rao Linfeng, a China-based hotel investment strategist. Overall room rates are still growing but at a slower pace this year as the post-pandemic travel demand surge loses steam and economic growth remains slow.\n\nThe decline in consumer spending at China\u2019s luxury hotels was \u201cevident\u201d, said Harlem Chow, a former executive at H World and Wyndham. \u201cFormer five-star hotel guests now choose four-star options, while four-star guests turn to upper mid-range hotels.\u201d Guests were also opting for cheaper brands and having fewer overnight stays, said Chow.\n\nAs international hotel groups target the more cost-conscious traveller, they face increased domestic competition.\n\nGroups such as H World and Atour were also investing in mid-range hotels, said Kevin Hei, business development manager at Empark Hotels & Resorts.\n\nThe higher-end market was \u201cunlikely to see a strong rebound any time soon\u201d, said Zhou of Jingjian Consulting, adding that international brands would increasingly see thin margins. \u201cUltimately, they\u2019ll have to compete just as aggressively as local brands do.\u201d", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a9d6e211-c8d0-4f5a-9d4d-2138a7c833e8"}, {"title": "Middle East becomes fastest-growing renewables market outside China", "description": "UAE\u2019s Masdar and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Acwa Power lead build out of huge solar farms", "author": "Malcolm Moore", "published_date": "2025-01-28T05:00:37.561Z", "content": "Until this month, the oil-rich United Arab Emirates had modest ambitions when it came to renewable energy: to install roughly as many solar panels each year as the UK.\n\nBut then Masdar, the country\u2019s state-owned renewable energy company, decided to make a splash at a huge trade fair in Abu Dhabi.\n\nIn front of the UAE president, it announced it would build a $6bn 5 gigawatt solar plant backed with more than 19GWh of battery storage \u2014 the largest such project ever attempted.\n\nWhen it starts in two years\u2019 time, its batteries will give the country a constant output of 1GW, enough to power more than 700,000 homes without having to rely on gas-fired plants when the sun is not shining.\n\n\u201cThis will transform renewable energy into baseload energy,\u201d said Sultan Al Jaber, the chair of Masdar. \u201cIt is a first step that could become a giant leap.\u201d\n\nAs the UAE was revealing its new solar project, Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil company, announced a joint venture that would start producing lithium, a key ingredient for batteries, as early as 2027.\n\nThe two countries, and their neighbours in the Gulf, have always been able to rely on their abundant reserves of fossil fuels, and both Saudi Arabia and the UAE plan to produce significantly more oil and gas in the years ahead.\n\nBut the Gulf is also accelerating its use of renewable energy, spying an economic opportunity to use cheap solar panels, wind turbines and batteries for its domestic electricity, and freeing up more oil and gas for export.\n\n\u201cThe perfect recipe [for renewable energy] exists here,\u201d said Mazin Khan, Masdar\u2019s chief financial officer, adding that the cost of the new solar and battery plant would be, for the first time, \u201ccomparable, if not cheaper, than conventional gas\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have abundant solar resources. We have relationships with manufacturers that we can leverage to get the best price possible. The regulatory market here in the UAE is very competitive and we have a line of commercial banks queueing up to be part of the project.\u201d\n\nThe most active companies bidding for contracts to build renewable projects in the Gulf are regional players including Masdar and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Acwa Power, Asian companies such as South Korea\u2019s Kepco, Japan\u2019s Jera and China\u2019s Jinko Power, and Europe\u2019s TotalEnergies, EDF and Engie.\n\nThe wider Middle East, including Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, is far behind Europe, the US and China in using renewable energy.\n\nAccording to the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena), the Middle East has less than 1 per cent of the world\u2019s renewable capacity. But from a low base, it is also the fastest-growing region outside China, in terms of adding capacity.\n\nWith a series of huge projects, the Gulf is rapidly changing its energy mix. In five years\u2019 time, renewables will make 30 per cent of the total capacity across Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, according to data from Rystad, an energy consultancy.\n\n\u201cThey have a lot of capital now from oil and gas, and they are trying to become less reliant on any one source of energy,\u201d said Vegard Wiik Vollset, head of renewables at Rystad.\n\n\u201cIt is also an economic benefit because they already have the best conditions for solar of almost anywhere in the world, and if you can get cheaper electricity than it costs for gas, you can export the gas instead.\u201d\n\nRystad\u2019s projections are based on multiple new project announcements across the region, but the energy consultancy also adjusts its forecast to take into account that the Gulf\u2019s ambitions appear to be running ahead of reality.\n\nSaudi Arabia, for example, targets to generate 50 per cent of its electricity from renewables by 2030, requiring it to install 130GW of renewables in just a few years, enough to power about 25mn homes. \u201cThey will have to ramp up their efforts quite substantially,\u201d said Vollset.\n\n\u201c2030 is quite soon. Of course, in the Middle East the turnaround can be very quick, like the UAE project. That timeline would never happen in Europe and North America.\u201d\n\nThe drive for renewables is also being fed by ambitions to build AI data centres and fledgling plans to produce \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen \u2014 a transition fuel that is electrolysed using renewable power \u2014 and export it to countries where higher power prices make its production uncompetitive.\n\nKuwait, which only had enough renewable capacity to power a few thousand homes at the end of 2023, according to Irena, awarded a contract in July last year to US engineering firm KBR to create 17GW of renewables, or enough energy for about 500,000 homes, and 25GW of green hydrogen capacity by 2050.\n\nMost of the suppliers of green products are Chinese. At this month\u2019s trade fair, dozens of the country\u2019s leading manufacturers crammed into Abu Dhabi\u2019s National Exhibition Centre, showing off a range of products customised for the local market, such as self-cleaning solar arrays, with robots that brush away dust and sand to keep panels running efficiently.\n\n\u201cOur batteries can withstand temperatures of over 60C, and they are sand, water and wind resistant,\u201d said Yong Liu, a marketing executive at BYD, one of China\u2019s leading battery and electric car companies.\n\nBYD provided the batteries for Saudi Arabia\u2019s Bisha plant, which until the UAE\u2019s announcement, was the world\u2019s largest solar and battery project.\n\n\u201cBusiness is growing very fast here and the projects are huge,\u201d said Beijing Hyperstrong, a well-established Chinese battery company. \u201cIt is a new emerging market for us. While we already set up a presence in Europe and the US, the Middle East is equally important for us in the long run.\u201d\n\nHowever, the challenge will be for Gulf states to integrate a rapid rollout of renewables into their power grids, said Vollset. \u201cWhat they do not currently have is the infrastructure, in terms of the grid, which is built for fossil fuels, not solar power. So there\u2019s a question mark over how they overcome that obstacle.\u201d\n\nData visualisation by Will Crofton in London", "tag": "china?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f3c69a7d-0db1-4882-8d35-02ec4c57ea53"}, {"title": "DeepSeek changes rules of AI\u2019s great game", "description": "Chinese start-up\u2019s breakthrough may be bad news for US tech giants, but could be a windfall for everyone else", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2025-01-27T15:29:33.269Z", "content": "It is hard to talk about 21st-century economic history without discussing the \u201cChina shock\u201d. That is the term often used to describe China\u2019s entrance into the global market, a change that brought rich countries an abundance of cheap goods, but left entire industries and workforces mothballed.\n\nDeepSeek may provide a sequel. A little-known Chinese hedge fund has thrown a grenade into the world of artificial intelligence with a large language model that, in effect, matches the market leader, Sam Altman\u2019s OpenAI, at a fraction of the cost. And while OpenAI treats its models\u2019 workings as proprietary, DeepSeek\u2019s R1 wears its technical innards on the outside, making it attractive for developers to use and build on.\n\nThings move faster in the AI age; terrifyingly so. Five of the biggest technology stocks geared to AI \u2014 chipmaker Nvidia and so-called hyperscalers Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms \u2014 collectively shed almost $750bn of market value before US markets opened on Monday. It could be particularly grim for Nvidia if it proves true that DeepSeek won without the use of its shiniest chips.\n\nInvestors in tech companies, including Europeans such as chipmaking equipment maker ASML, and energy companies that investors hoped would get a boost from fuelling data centres, are left wondering whether their investments will go up in smoke. The hyperscalers were due to plough almost $300bn into capital expenditure this year, according to Visible Alpha estimates. Analysts expect that on Wednesday, when they report earnings, Meta and Microsoft will report investment for 2024 totalling $94bn.\n\nIn truth, the game is not over. DeepSeek\u2019s actual potential is still unclear, and it has yet to achieve \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d, the humanlike state that Meta and OpenAI are pursuing. But the rules might have changed. At the very least, DeepSeek may take some of the US giants\u2019 customers. At worst, it has challenged the core belief that more hardware is the key to better AI. That principle has underpinned the market value of Silicon Valley companies as they invest hand over fist.\n\nWhat is bad for the hyperscalers could still be a windfall for everyone else. For most business users, having the absolute best model is less important than having one that\u2019s reliable and good enough. Not every driver needs a Ferrari. Advances in reasoning such as R1 could be a big step for \u201cagents\u201d that deal with customers and perform tasks in the workplace. If those are available more cheaply, corporate profitability should rise.\n\nIn that sense, this second China shock could resemble the first. It could bring not just destruction but a reshuffling \u2014 albeit a painful one for many. Researchers have estimated that for every job lost to the China shock, US households\u2019 purchasing power rose by more than $400,000.

It said chief executive Zhu Jiusheng had departed for \u201chealth reasons\u201d.\n\nThe \u201csudden and simultaneous\u201d resignations were \u201cunprecedented in recent memory\u201d for a big participant such as Vanke, said Foreky Wong, founding partner at Hong Kong advisory company Fortune Ark Restructuring.\n\nVanke said in a separate filing that it expected to have made a loss of Rmb45bn ($6.2bn) in 2024, compared with profits of Rmb12bn a year earlier, highlighting a continued decline in sales of new homes in China. The company said it was experiencing \u201ctemporary liquidity difficulties\u201d due to the loss.\n\nXin Jie, head of Shenzhen Metro, which owns about a third of Vanke, will become the company\u2019s new chair. Vanke is now set to become the latest test of authorities\u2019 willingness to support individual developers, which typically borrow heavily to finance their activities. Vanke has Rmb36bn of capital market debt coming due this year.\n\nGiven the company\u2019s well-known status in China, its struggles also pose a fresh challenge to homebuyer confidence, which remains weak despite a barrage of recent efforts from policymakers.\n\nRather than carrying out individual bailouts, Beijing has, since Evergrande\u2019s default in 2021, prioritised completing unfinished projects, reducing borrowing costs for homeowners and encouraging banks and other lenders to refinance the sector.\n\nPolicymakers unveiled vast credit lines from state-owned banks in late 2022 and, in May, announced a new policy of encouraging state-owned enterprises to buy unsold housing. However, overall investment and sales have continued to decline, weighing on China\u2019s economic momentum.\n\nZerlina Zeng, head of Asia credit strategy at CreditSights, said the crucial question was how much contagion risk Vanke\u2019s plight would create, adding that the central and local governments might not be expecting \u201cso much of a systemic impact\u201d from a restructuring.\n\n\u201cIf the market thinks otherwise and we see a funding freeze\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and that leads to banks becoming even less willing to extend money to property, even at the project level, then that would [mean] big trouble for the Chinese government,\u201d she said.\n\nThe resignations at Vanke come after a period of mounting concern over its liquidity, echoing the experience of other developers such as Country Garden in 2023.

They were in addition to a 10 per cent standard import tariff for the industry.\n\nThe anti-subsidy tariffs came after an EU investigation launched in 2023 on China\u2019s unfair support for its EV industry. Brussels found that carmakers had benefited from soft loans, cheap land deals and subsidies for suppliers such as steelmakers.\n\nAbout a fifth of all electric cars sold across the EU last year, or 300,000 units, were built in China.\u00a0Tesla accounted for 28 per cent of Chinese-made EVs imported into the bloc in 2023, more than any other brand, according to Transport and Environment, an environmental NGO.\n\nTesla was hit with the lowest tariff after an individual examination by the EU found that it received the smallest amount of support from the Chinese government.\n\nTesla executives have said they are adjusting their import policy from China to respond to the EU tariffs.

In 2018, they began rolling out a centralised drug procurement scheme, replacing a fragmented system in which hospitals negotiated individually for medical supplies.\n\nThe programme drove down costs, with the average price of some medications falling more than 50 per cent. But some of those discounts came from replacing more expensive, off-patent drugs from companies such as AstraZeneca and GSK with cheaper domestic alternatives. Patients and doctors have expressed concerns about the effectiveness of some domestic generics.\n\nIn a rare public complaint on January 16, Zheng Minhua, a senior surgeon at Shanghai\u2019s Ruijin Hospital, and 19 other prominent doctors, said it was an \u201cundeniable fact\u201d that domestic drugs showed poor efficacy with their patients, even when dosages were increased.\n\n\u201cHypertension does not drop effectively, anaesthetics do not put patients to sleep and laxatives do not cause diarrhoea,\u201d they wrote in a policy proposal submitted to Shanghai\u2019s municipal legislature and seen by the Financial Times. \u201cQuestionable drug efficacy poses the greatest safety risk to patients,\u201d they added.\n\nThe doctors called for \u201cgreater flexibility\u201d in drug contract bidding to have western brand-named drugs covered by insurance.\n\nGrowing public anger prompted the National Healthcare Security Administration to dispatch a team to Shanghai last Tuesday to examine hospital data on domestic generic prescriptions, according to a statement.\n\nThe issue of medical safety is especially sensitive in China, where past scandals over tainted infant formula and blood transfusions that had proven deadly stoked public outrage over lax regulations.\n\nChinese patients can still purchase some foreign drugs online, but they are not covered by insurance, and doctors usually do not provide advice on non-approved medication. In the procurement process for Shanghai\u2019s public health system last month, more than 20 foreign brands including Pfizer, Bayer and MSD sent bids for 32 off-patent drugs. None were selected.\n\nForeign companies have also become increasingly vocal about lack of access to China\u2019s drugs and medical devices market.\n\nThe European Union Chamber of Commerce in China told the FT it \u201cwould closely monitor\u201d the probe, adding that it hoped \u201cto see steps taken to ensure that the procurement system for drugs does not prioritise low prices at the expense of product safety and clinical outcomes\u201d.\n\nAmerican Chamber of Commerce in China president Michael Hart said: \u201cIf companies can\u2019t sell and make a reasonable profit in China, they won\u2019t offer their products and services to China.

Such a move would \u201clower the entrance barrier of these competitors\u201d, adding: \u201cI believe in free trade.\u201d\n\nAudi has partnered with MG-maker SAIC to build EVs in China that appeal to local consumers \u2014 a type of collaboration that D\u00f6llner said Chinese brands might also seek to recreate in Europe.\n\nIn a separate interview, David Powels, chief financial officer at the VW brand, would also not rule out the idea of Chinese carmakers taking over idle production lines at the company\u2019s German plants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re open for any discussion on any topic with any partner,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a dynamic world, you have to keep all options open.\u201d\n\nThe comments come as Europe\u2019s legacy carmakers race to shift to EVs, a segment where Chinese brands such as BYD are producing what are considered more technologically advanced vehicles, helped both by subsidies from Beijing and a lower cost base.\n\nFor decades, China was VW\u2019s most profitable market but in the past five years, the market share of its flagship brand has nearly halved due to its weak position in the rapidly growing battery-run vehicle market.\n\nEurope\u2019s largest carmaker has also been hit hard by the shrinking automotive market in its home region, where 2mn fewer cars were sold last year compared with five years earlier.\n\nLast month, VW reached an agreement with workers at its flagship brand to scale back production capacity across Germany, avoiding a more drastic plan that would have involved closing at least three plants in the country.\n\nThe closure of production lines means that the VW brand \u2014 which accounts for roughly half of the group\u2019s sales by volume \u2014 was set to reduce its annual capacity by roughly 730,000 cars from about 1.5mn by 2030, the carmaker said.\n\nExcess capacity started to rise during the pandemic when VW began cancelling night shifts due to lower demand, with the brand producing about 900,000 cars in Germany in 2024.\n\nVW\u2019s plants will have to reach new undisclosed productivity targets to fight for remaining capacity, and those unable to meet them will be considered for \u201calternative use\u201d \u2014 which could include being put up for sale.\n\nSome Chinese carmakers see using excess production capacity in Europe as a way to enhance their presence in the bloc.\n\nStellantis, for example, has taken a 20 per cent stake in Chinese start-up Leapmotor, giving it exclusive rights to build and sell Leapmotor cars outside China through a joint venture.

Instead, it has a long-term policy of allowing the Singapore dollar to gradually appreciate against other currencies.\n\nBy reducing the slope of its appreciation, the monetary authority in effect lowers borrowing rates in the city-state\u2019s heavily trade-dependent economy.\n\nThe move \u2014 the first time the MAS has loosened policy since the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020 \u2014 came after inflation data released on Thursday showed the city-state\u2019s core consumer price index rose 1.8 per cent in December from a year earlier, the second consecutive month of growth below 2 per cent.\n\nThe central bank also lowered its inflation forecast for 2025 to between 1 and 2 per cent, down from 1.5 to 2.5 per cent in October. Although the MAS does not set a hard inflation target, it has said a rate under 2 per cent \u201cis consistent with overall price stability\u201d.\n\nSingapore\u2019s small and open economy is highly exposed to global trade and financial flows, allowing the MAS to control lending rates through the exchange rate.

More than 1,000 employees could be affected, and the tax difference could be as high as 21 percentage points depending on individual salaries, as both countries have a tiered tax structure.\n\nSingapore has emerged as a regional hub for many Chinese companies looking to expand into south-east Asia and globally. Tech giants Alibaba, Tencent and PDD, as well as start-ups such as Shein, have set up offices in the city-state, where lower tax rates have convinced many Chinese workers to relocate.\n\nChina in recent years has increased efforts to collect tax revenue to fill government coffers, including demanding wealthy individuals and companies double-check for unpaid liabilities, amid a broad economic slowdown.\n\nIn 2019, Beijing revised its income tax rules to allow authorities to collect revenue from Chinese expats, similar to US rules on Americans living abroad, but it has not enforced them rigorously. Most Chinese citizens working abroad only need to report their taxable income on a voluntary basis, and Beijing has not outlined consequences for those who do not.\n\nFor higher-paid workers at ByteDance, the potential difference could be massive.

It has been 60 years since Malaysia expelled Singapore from its federation, forcing the latter into independence as a city-state amid racial tensions and political clashes between both sides.\n\nFor most of the past six decades, the two countries have viewed each other with suspicion and been locked in a deep rivalry, one in which Singapore, Malaysia\u2019s biggest trading partner, has been the clear victor. It has established itself as a global trading and finance hub, with GDP a head of $94,000 compared with Malaysia\u2019s $14,400.\n\nBut Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House this week, his promise to implement a spate of tariffs and a slowing Chinese economy have made Malaysia and Singapore look to strengthen ties.\n\n\u201cGenerations of Malaysian and Singaporean leaders had to manage [this rivalry] and that stopped us from doing what is common sense to everyone, which is to integrate Singapore and Johor better,\u201d Malaysian economy minister Rafizi Ramli told the FT, referring to the Malaysian state bordering Singapore. \u201cOperating as nearly an economic unit will offer investors the best of both worlds.\u201d\n\nModelled on China\u2019s Shenzhen special economic zone, which borders Hong Kong, but is twice its size, the JSSEZ is central to Malaysia\u2019s ambitions to build on its 5 per cent economic growth last year.\n\nMalaysia has already positioned its economy to play a key role in the global demand for artificial intelligence, from developing one of Asia\u2019s biggest semiconductor hubs in the northern island of Penang over several decades, to more recently welcoming big tech companies to set up data centres in the south.\n\nIt has also benefited from \u201cChina plus one\u201d, a strategy in which multinational companies complement their Chinese operations with investments in regional countries to diversify risk and lower costs.\n\nThe government hopes the JSSEZ will add $26bn a year to its economy by 2030, bringing in 20,000 skilled jobs and 50 new projects.\n\nIt has offered generous corporate tax rates of just 5 per cent for 15 years for companies investing in areas such as AI and quantum computing, as well as manufacturing high-end equipment. That compares with typical rates of 15-24 per cent in Malaysia and lows of 17 per cent in Singapore.\n\nJohor has already been a critical engine for the Malaysian economy in recent years, thanks in part to its pro-business sultan becoming the country\u2019s king a year ago.\n\nThe state has emerged as a global hub for data centres, drawing in more than $25bn of investment from the likes of Nvidia, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance and creating 35,000 jobs.\n\nWhile Johor provides plenty of cheap land, water, energy and labour to develop the projects, Singapore offers an entry point for investors.\n\n\u201cConceptually [the special economic zone] has the ability to leverage Singapore\u2019s global finance and logistics centre capabilities with Johor\u2019s access to competitive land, labour and energy to deliver a differentiated proposition \u2014 especially for supply chains looking for alternatives to north Asia amid the US-China trade war,\u201d said Maybank analyst Thilan Wickramasinghe.\n\nBut it is not just big tech companies the JSSEZ is aimed at attracting.

I had a terrific evening yesterday at a London production of Kyoto, a new play that brings to life the first decade of international climate negotiations \u2014 and the oil industry machinations that sought to undermine them. It\u2019s a fast-paced, innovative staging that conveys the raw intensity of climate diplomacy, and the tremendously high stakes involved. Don\u2019t take my word for it: here\u2019s the lowdown from the FT\u2019s theatre critic.\n\nOne of the key flashpoints in the play is the intense argument at the 1997 Kyoto summit over carbon offset trading. Almost three decades on, the controversy around carbon markets has only grown. But as we highlight in today\u2019s newsletter, some investors are still seeing opportunities in the troubled sector.\n\nReports of the death of the voluntary carbon market may yet prove exaggerated. The $32mn funding round announced yesterday by London-based carbon credit rating agency BeZero Carbon would be seen as small beer in some industries. But for the carbon credit sector, battered over the past two years by a reputational crisis and a fundraising drought, it looks like a noteworthy shot in the arm.\n\nBeZero\u2019s fundraising provides fresh evidence of the outsized role that Singapore has taken in the carbon credit market. The lead investor is GenZero, launched in 2022 with $3.6bn of committed capital from Temasek, Singapore\u2019s $288bn sovereign wealth fund.\n\nFrom the start, GenZero has had a mandate to invest in promoting carbon market development as one of its three core focus areas \u2014 alongside the related field of nature-based projects, and broader climate technology. \u201cWe think the journey towards net zero will be impossible without effective carbon markets,\u201d chief executive Frederick Teo told me.\n\nTeo said the investment in BeZero reflected the need for transparent and reliable data that would allow buyers to identify high-quality credits and regain confidence in the market. Transaction value in the voluntary carbon market fell from $2.1bn in 2021 to $723mn in 2023, according to Ecosystem Marketplace. Separate data from MSCI shows that volumes and prices remained depressed last year. Corporate buyers have taken fright at media and academic allegations that many projects have hugely exaggerated their carbon benefits.\n\nTommy Ricketts, BeZero\u2019s chief executive, said the company had about 150 clients for its credit ratings and broader market data, assembled by a full-time employee base that included 77 scientists. Ricketts added that, given BeZero\u2019s leading role in ratings and the industry\u2019s growing emphasis on transparency, an investment in BeZero amounted to \u201ca leveraged play\u201d on the future growth of the carbon market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just about waiting for that inflection, that catalyst, whatever it may be,\u201d Ricketts said.\n\nWill that wait pay off? If this market does return to growth, Singapore will deserve a share of the credit. Singaporean companies can now use carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their liabilities under its national carbon tax regime. That tax currently stands at about S$25 ($18.30) a tonne \u2014 a quarter of the price under the EU\u2019s emissions trading scheme \u2014 but is set to rise significantly in the next few years.\n\nThis means that, unlike most other governments, Singapore has given its companies a real economic incentive to invest in carbon credits. It\u2019s taken a fairly careful approach on which sorts of credits can be used, setting out minimum standards and forming agreements with individual countries on the use of projects in their jurisdictions.\n\nAll this, Ricketts argued, was part of a push by Singapore to become \u201cthe hub of carbon\u201d \u2014 a bet that, despite its current travails, the carbon credit market could become one of real economic significance, and that this entrepreneurial city-state could become its global centre of gravity.\n\nIf that is indeed the strategy, GenZero appears to be its financial spearhead. The fund has made a series of investments in carbon credit companies \u2014 notably in Climate Impact X, a Singapore-based carbon marketplace. Other investments have included South Pole, one of the largest carbon credit consultancies, and Perennial, which uses machine learning and remote sensing to assess the carbon impact of soil projects.\n\nAll these companies have been affected by the headwinds assailing the sector \u2014 notably South Pole, which has been embroiled in some of the more high-profile controversies over project quality.\n\nBut Teo \u2014 along with GenZero\u2019s financial backer, the Singaporean government \u2014 is betting that a turnaround in the market will come in due course. The integration of carbon credits in mandatory carbon pricing schemes, as pioneered by Singapore, is one potential driver of demand. Another is a major change in the international rules for airlines: from 2027, nearly all of them will be required to buy carbon credits unless they achieve big emission reductions.\n\nThen there is the long-awaited international carbon trading mechanism that was promised in the text of the 2015 Paris Agreement. At November\u2019s COP29 in Baku, a basic agreement on what credits could be used in this mechanism was hailed by some as a breakthrough, though there remains a huge amount of work to do before that system will be up and running.\n\nAll this may sound far too optimistic to the many who see the voluntary carbon market as a busted flush. And unless the market can address the serious concerns that have been raised around quality and integrity , it is highly questionable whether its growth will be beneficial to the global struggle against climate change.\n\nBut Singapore clearly thinks this sector is worth a punt, albeit a fairly modest one by the standards of the huge sums deployed by its sovereign investment funds. It\u2019s also an opportunity to strengthen its ties with developing nations around the world, which are home to the bulk of carbon credit projects.\n\nWith the clear mandate and stable funding that he\u2019s been given by the government, Teo is able to be far more patient than most investors in this space. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a constructive view of carbon markets for the long term,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt would be naive to imagine things will be hunky-dory in 2025 or 2026.\u201d\n\nNew era How will sustainable investing survive the return of Donald Trump?\n\nExpensive medicine EU pollution rules could force European carmakers to pay large sums to Chinese rivals for carbon credits.\n\nDamage limitation Reinsurance companies may absorb less than 3 per cent of insured losses from the Los Angeles fires, having cut their risk exposure in recent years.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e97dd32a-7c46-4d59-bbd5-20ad8bc6571d"}, {"title": "British activist investor seeks to disrupt Singapore\u2019s Great Eastern takeover", "description": "Palliser Capital accuses OCBC of treating insurer\u2019s minority shareholders unfairly as activist campaigns pick up in Asia", "author": "Owen Walker", "published_date": "2025-01-15T05:00:27.195Z", "content": "A British activist investor has appealed to Singapore\u2019s markets regulator to intervene in the takeover of an insurer by the city-state\u2019s second-biggest bank, calling the deal \u201cgravely unfair\u201d for shareholders.\n\nThe move by Palliser Capital, which has taken on several high-profile companies since its founders broke away from Elliott four years ago, is the latest in a wave of activist campaigns in Asia in the past year.\n\nThere were 57 campaigns against Asian companies in 2024, up from a previous record of 44 the year before, according to Lazard, with Japanese groups Sumitomo Corporation, SoftBank and Nissan all being targeted in the past six months.\n\nGreat Eastern is Singapore\u2019s oldest and largest life insurer. Palliser, which has a stake in Great Eastern, has accused OCBC of treating minority shareholders unfairly in its attempted full takeover of the company.\n\nIn letters sent to the Monetary Authority of Singapore and SGX stock exchange, seen by the Financial Times, the activist accused the Great Eastern board of being \u201chighly complacent\u201d in recommending the offer.\n\nIt added that the insurer\u2019s \u201ccorporate governance safeguards designed to protect the interests of minority shareholders were lacking or insufficiently robust\u201d.\n\nIn response, the MAS and SGX told Palliser they were monitoring the case and engaging with both sides, according to communications seen by the FT.\n\nGreat Eastern, which has more than S$100bn (US$73bn) in assets and 16mn policyholders in Singapore and Malaysia, has been part-owned by OCBC since 1958. A minority of shares, about 6 per cent, are listed on Singapore\u2019s stock exchange.\n\nIn 2008, OCBC increased its stake in the insurer to 87 per cent and announced a voluntary offer in May last year to take full control of the business for S$1.4bn, or S$25.60 a share, a 37 per cent premium on the share price at the time.\n\nEY provided a valuation to the insurer, which put it at a range of S$28.87 to S$36.19 a share, though Palliser believes it should be higher.\n\nThe activist argued that senior Great Eastern executives and board members \u2014 several of whom are former OCBC executives \u2014 had conflicts of interest because they received a large proportion of their pay in the bank\u2019s stock and therefore benefited from a lower offer price.\n\nPalliser complained to the MAS about the Great Eastern board\u2019s refusal to meet the activist investor over the issue.\n\n\u201cGreat Eastern\u2019s seeming unwillingness to engage with us in any meaningful sense has added to our sense of unease and frustration and made us determined to ensure that the interests of Great Eastern\u2019s remaining minority shareholders are safeguarded,\u201d the investor wrote.\n\nForeign activist forays are relatively rare in Singapore, which prides itself on being a business-friendly financial hub. But several recent cases have led to Swiss and Australian activists pushing for better deals for minority shareholders in takeover deals.\n\nMany of the campaigns against Asian companies are focused on breaking up multi-industry conglomerates, with Asia-Pacific catching up with Europe as the second most active region behind the US.\n\nAmong Palliser\u2019s recent campaigns are a move to force Rio Tinto to abandon its primary London listing and consolidate its Australian business, as well as pushing for change at a Japanese property company and a rail operator with a stake in Tokyo Disneyland\u2019s owner.\n\nPalliser, OCBC, the MAS and SGX declined to comment on the Great Eastern campaign.

The figure has been in steady decline since hitting a high of 782 in 2013, with domestic companies attracted to overseas listings, especially in larger and more heavily traded markets such as the US.\n\n\u201cI surely hope that this year is a low point,\u201d said Clifford Lee, head of the investment bank at DBS, south-east Asia\u2019s biggest lender and Singapore\u2019s most valuable public company. \u201cIt\u2019s a result of various factors coming together.\u201d\n\nShein, the Chinese fast-fashion business based in Singapore since 2022, is considering a London listing with a potential \u00a350bn market valuation, which would make it one of the UK\u2019s largest public companies. Several of Singapore\u2019s best-known businesses, including superapp Grab and ecommerce group Sea, have opted for New York listings in recent years.\n\nSingapore has benefited from a flood of private capital flowing into the city-state, which has coincided with a burgeoning family office sector, while the SGX has also built up strong bond trading, derivatives and real estate investment trust markets. But it has struggled to repeat that growth with initial public offerings.\n\nOver the summer, the Monetary Authority of Singapore launched a review of the country\u2019s equity markets, with a panel that included the heads of the SGX, monetary authority and Temasek, the state-owned investment company.\n\nThe group is due to report its findings next August and has so far discussed ways of attracting more fund managers to invest in the stock market in order to address demand issues, while relaxing some disclosure rules and investor safeguards to encourage more companies to list, according to a person involved in the talks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chicken and an egg situation,\u201d the person said. \u201cWe have to make it attractive for good companies to list and see more fund managers in the market, and they will only be attracted by the prospect of investing in good companies.\u201d\n\nThe regulator said in a statement: \u201cMany ideas have been surfaced as the review group is engaging broadly with many groups of stakeholders and the review group discussions are still ongoing.\u201d\n\nSeveral investment bankers told the Financial Times that 2024 was likely to be the nadir for listings in Singapore due to the political uncertainty of general elections around the world. They said there was pent-up demand, and they were working on several IPOs for next year.\n\nThe four companies that went public with a primary listing on the SGX this year \u2014 all of which were on the junior Catalist market \u2014 had a combined IPO value of just $31mn and included a chain of karaoke bars and an operator of Japanese restaurants.\n\nThe largest company to list, the Singapore Institute of Advanced Medicine healthcare group, has shed 71 per cent of its market value since its March IPO after reporting heavy losses. Its auditor, PwC, raised questions about its ability to continue as a going concern over the summer.\n\nStock markets around the world \u2014 notably London \u2014 have struggled to attract listings in the face of fierce competition and high valuations in the US. The amount raised through IPOs across south-east Asia this year is the lowest in at least 10 years, according to Dealogic.\n\nEven so, Malaysia has had 46 IPOs this year, compared with 39 in Indonesia and 28 in Thailand. While the Philippines had just three listings, their total value of $197mn far outpaced Singapore\u2019s $31mn.\n\nMost of the companies that listed in other south-east Asian markets were domestic, whereas Singapore is positioning itself as a global hub for international public companies.\n\n\u201cThe strategic infrastructure is here, the liquidity available in the market to invest in new listings is here,\u201d said DBS\u2019s Lee, who is involved in the MAS review. \u201cNow we need a good supply of companies choosing to list. We have a healthy pipeline for the year ahead. It\u2019s like a well-oiled, sleek machine that hasn\u2019t been used.\u201d\n\nOne option often mooted is whether to allow Singapore\u2019s compulsory savings system \u2014 the Central Provident Fund, typically used to finance retirement, healthcare and property purchases \u2014 to invest more in the domestic stock market.\n\n\u201cThat would create new pools of money to help drive up multiples and would probably spark IPOs,\u201d said Jayden Vantarakis, head of south-east Asian equities research at Macquarie, who covers the SGX.\n\nBut he doubts that such reforms will materialise and downgraded the SGX from \u201coutperform\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d in November, partly on expectations that the MAS review would fail to prevent the decline in listings.\n\nAdditional reporting

the Singapore-China link.\n\nAssets in the scheme grew by S$24mn ($17.9mn) in September and October, accounting for nearly 80 per cent of total asset growth in the preceding 12 months, according to the SGX.\n\nChinese investors accounted for 70 per cent of total flows, indicating interest among onshore investors for Singapore-listed ETFs.\n\nWang expects that overall Chinese investor sentiment is likely to pick up if the Chinese government is more proactive in supporting the market in light of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in the US.\n\nWing Chan, head of manager research for Asia Pacific at Morningstar, said Chinese domestic investors still had untapped demand for wider offshore exposure, which the Singapore-China ETF link could provide.\n\nHistorically, much of the offshore access has been via Hong Kong channels and Hong Kong products, he said, but many of these actually still invest in Chinese assets.\n\nIn addition to market performance factors, misalignment between partner fund firms in the scheme, particularly around commercial terms, has been a key reason behind the heretofore slow uptake in the scheme.\n\n\u201cFor many of the issuers, they have limited experience working on a partnership with a Chinese asset manager, and vice versa,\u201d said SGX\u2019s Wang.\n\nThe part that took up the most time was usually around the \u201cbilateral discussion to agree on the commercial terms\u201d, such as who would drive fundraising and flows, and the overall objective of the partnership, he noted.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT

It\u2019s worth\u00a0popping in if only to\u00a0perch at one\u00a0of\u00a0its wine bars with a glass of cava and\u00a0a\u00a0plate of boquerones. It\u2019s chaos, but\u00a0that\u00a0is\u00a0part of this mercado\u2019s (and\u00a0Madrid\u2019s)\u00a0charm. Niki Blasina\n\nFounded during the Arab domination of Sicily, Mercato del Capo remains one of\u00a0the\u00a0more multicultural corners of the city. Here you can find Nigerian textile traders rubbing shoulders with burly fishmongers expertly filleting tunas, or\u00a0sample myriad olives and cheeses from\u00a0the island\u2019s hinterland. My grandfather taught me to come early, and\u00a0make a beeline for the cart selling steaming slices of sfincione (a focaccia-like bread served\u00a0with oregano, anchovies and\u00a0caciocavallo cheese). Ben Marino\n\nInspired by the designs of one of the city\u2019s most famous sons, Gustave Eiffel, this Dijon market is a vaulted, ironwork theatre of Burgundian gastronomy. Four days a week, Les Halles hums with local producers selling Charolais beef for the classic b\u0153uf \u00e0\u00a0la bourguignonne, giant wheels of Comt\u00e9 cheese from the nearby Jura, as well as the wines, more cheeses, chickens, mushrooms, snails and mustards for which the region is famed. John Thornhill\n\nChapel Market is part of my life, my identity. It\u2019s always felt under threat but\u00a0never died \u2013 it really is the place where\u00a0everyone knows your name. It is\u00a0where\u00a0you\u00a0go for last glimpses of a mixed\u00a0London\u00a0community with some good\u00a0veg and excellent chat. Now there is\u00a0a\u00a0farmers\u2019 market too, but it\u2019s the old-fashioned \u201cnormal\u201d market that gives\u00a0me the most joy\u00a0and the avocados I\u00a0can actually afford. Juliet Riddell\n\nFor more than a century, Grand Central Market in Los Angeles\u2019s downtown historic district has celebrated the city\u2019s many food\u00a0cultures under one roof. While legacy vendors such as China Cafe (c1959), best known for its huge bowls of wonton soup and off-menu egg rolls, reign on, in recent years a host of new businesses has been welcomed into the fold, from Lucky Bird, the market\u2019s first and only stall dedicated to fried chicken and its accoutrements (read: waffles dripping in syrup) to award-winning smashburgers at For The Win. Not to be missed: the all-day breakfast burritos at\u00a0Jose\u00a0Chiquito. In\u00e8s Cross\n\nOne of this famously gastronomic city\u2019s largest markets opened in 1859 and\u00a0was\u00a0renamed after the late chef Paul\u00a0Bocuse, a native son, in 2006 following a\u00a0total\u00a0renovation. Today it covers\u00a0three floors with more than 13,500sq m, and is home\u00a0to\u00a054 stalls and restaurants. Don\u2019t\u00a0miss Mons fromager, one of the best cheesemongers in France; Patisserie Seve for a sticky pink tarte aux pralines; and Bobosse for Lyonnais charcuterie like plump pistachio-studded fresh sausage. Great eats on the spot include Baba La\u00a0Grenouille for frogs\u2019 legs en persillade and\u00a0Chez Les Gones for local comfort food\u00a0like quenelles de brochet (pike dumplings). Alexander Lobrano\n\nAt this, one of the biggest food markets in\u00a0Europe, more\u00a0than 1,200 stalls sell everything from\u00a0fresh fruit, meat, cheese and live eels.\u00a0Forage for\u00a0a picnic lunch, admire the\u00a0stained-glass windows or spend\u00a0the\u00a0afternoon sipping cold beer and\u00a0eating\u00a0a\u00a0loin sandwich at Richard Camarena\u2019s Central Bar. Sally Hickey\n\n\u201cPeaceful\u201d is the last word most would use to describe Singapore\u2019s hawker markets. That\u2019s why locals often skip the more famous ones in the central area for East Coast Lagoon Food Village, in one of the city-state\u2019s largest beach parks. There you can find food-market staples including satay, sugar-cane juice and Hainanese chicken rice, plus seafood specialities such as chilli crab and fried oysters, all served with ocean views. Taylor Nicole Rogers\n\nDubbed the chicest market in Paris by Le Figaro, this lively open-air market is popular with Parisian chefs for the exceptional quality of stands such as Le\u00a0Bar\u00a0\u00e0 Patates, which specialises in\u00a0potatoes, mushrooms and fresh herbs,\u00a0and La Bergerie du Mesnil, run by\u00a0Sandy Brown McKeen, an Irish farmer who lives in Normandy and produces exceptional yoghurt, cream, milk, and meat.\u00a0La Maison Priolet is also renowned for its game and high-quality poultry. A\u00a0variety of food stands serve food to eat on the hoof,\u00a0such as grilled Lebanese bread and Breton\u00a0cr\u00eapes, plus juicy rotisserie chickens\u00a0that make for a great picnic or fast\u00a0meal in a holiday flat. AL\n\nUnder the deep shade of century-old plane\u00a0trees, dotted across the central town\u00a0square, market traders from surrounding villages sell local produce. Bellows cheese made in an identical way\u00a0since\u00a0the 14th century, renowned Herzegovinian wine, honey, medicinal herbs and prosciutto are just a few of the delights on offer. After food tasting and shopping, visitors sit in the caf\u00e9s on the square to cool down with a lemonade and enjoy people-watching. Tatjana Mitevska\n\nTsukiji has got everything, from unctuous otoro to the ethically questionable (but legal) whale skewers. Try a hearty bowl of beef intestine and miso stew at Kitsuneya. Then head to Iroha for mochi topped with giant strawberries, especially if the Amaou variety is in season. For post-prandial coffee, grab a cup of City Blend at John Lennon\u2019s go-to shop Yonemoto. Kristine Ching\n\nWith more than 200 vendors selling everything from passion fruit to poke bowls, this indoor-outdoor market is a\u00a0vibrant must-experience on Hawaii\u2019s Big\u00a0Island. With special sections for tropical\u00a0plants (orchids and anthuriums are\u00a0abundant), macadamia nuts and artisanal oils, as well as colourful sarongs and hand-carved wooden accessories, this\u00a0is a one-stop-shop. Be sure to sample\u00a0the fruits of the season \u2013 white pineapples, thimble berries, strawberry papayas, guavas \u2013 and the local Kona coffee, preferably on Wednesdays and Saturdays when the market is particularly popping. Christina Ohly Evans\n\nThe glass-walled market hall in the centre of town offers a taste of Copenhagen\u2019s culinary prowess. Both a food market and an incubator for chefs, Torvehallerne is home to more than 60 restaurant stalls and purveyors of artisanal food and drink, flowers, plants and kitchen tools. Danish specialities are plenty: rows of sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d with kaleidoscopic toppings, artfully folded pastries and dense rye breads. Cuisines from around the world are also well represented, from Spanish tapas to Mexican tacos to Chinese cr\u00eapes. Though on a cold day, it\u2019s the fresh pasta at Il Mattarello that really makes my heart sing. NB\n\nN\u00eemes\u2019 elegant 19th-century glass-and-steel market pavilion was replaced by a modern cement structure in the 1970s, but\u00a0this did nothing to dent the passion of\u00a0the food-loving N\u00eemois. Visit Nadal, a century-old coffee roaster; Les Fromages de\u00a0Sylvain, for his excellent selection of cheeses and wonderful sense of humour; and the new stall selling brandade de N\u00eemes, the creamy garlicky salt-cod preparation that\u2019s the city\u2019s best-known dish. Plan on lunch at La Pie Qui Couette, a\u00a0counter-seating, lunch-only restaurant that\u2019s hugely popular for its cuisine du march\u00e9 menu, but get there early. AL\n\nTucked away in one corner of the old stone town, this small market offers an unusual mix of high-quality continental and Mediterranean food. Located at the entry of\u00a0Montenegro Boka Bay, it is supplied by\u00a0tropical fruit grown in villages on the\u00a0coast, such as fortunela, oranges, pomegranate, lemons and kiwis, as well as\u00a0fresh seafood. Farmers from villages in\u00a0the\u00a0mountains surrounding the town bring traditional authentic produce such as\u00a0the renowned prosciutto from Njegu\u0161i, potatoes from Kru\u0161evice, goat\u2019s cheese, wild asparagus and wild garlic. TM\n\nThis is in my hometown, and it certainly beats more renowned markets like La Boqueria. It\u2019s a combination of great food stalls, particularly Asian, veggie shopping for the ordinary person and lot of foodie-type stalls. It\u2019s a tale of a market that can\u00a0provide a focus for a city and enrich it\u00a0\u2013 and a tale of the integration of the various tides of immigrants from Italy and\u00a0Greece in the postwar period, Vietnamese, Cambodians and Lebanese in\u00a0the 1970s and \u201980s and Chinese and Indians more recently. Tony Tassell\n\nWest Philadelphia converges with Pennsylvania\u2019s yeoman tradition at the Clark\u00a0Park Farmers\u2019 Market. Every Saturday, Amish farmers hawk their produce across from West Philly and East Kensington businesses selling pound cakes or seafood. One can enjoy new Philadelphia favourites Nilaa Coffee, Aaji\u2019s Kitchen or Lost Bread or just as easily buy preserves and cheese from a family-owned farm, in a space that is testament to Philadelphia\u2019s shifting yet venerable culinary\u00a0scene. Aiden Reiter\n\nThis is the largest and cheapest market in the city, with its home in the garden of the Gunduli\u0107 summer villa. Locals come early in\u00a0the morning to buy fresh fish straight off the boats from the Elafiti islands. Farmers from Dubrovnik\u2019s Konavle suburb sell a wide selection of their organic produce here\u00a0throughout the day. Traditional local delicacies such as dried figs, candied orange peel, extra-virgin olive oil and quince jelly are also available as souvenirs for visitors. TM\n\nThis is the most popular and the best-stocked food market in the Serbian capital. Located in Vra\u010dar in the heart of the city, it\u00a0is named after Vlajko Kaleni\u0107, who donated the land on which it was built almost a century ago. A vast variety of\u00a0produce, from home-distilled brandy rakija,\u00a0kaymak cheese and fruit and vegetables to cured meats and spices, is on\u00a0display on stalls where sellers and buyers haggle, joke and even sing. Many locals tell me they change their walking routes just to enjoy\u00a0the splendid site of colourful stalls\u00a0full of fragrant produce. TM\n\nDescribed by the preeminent Breton chef Olivier Roellinger as \u201cthe best larder in Brittany\u201d, the second-largest food market in France was founded in 1622. Some 300 stalls sell everything from seafood landed only hours earlier to Roscoff onions, big\u00a0snowy cauliflowers, dozens of apple varieties, honey and other foods that comprise what Roellinger describes as \u201cthe\u00a0Celtic diet\u201d. Treat yourself to a grilled pork sausage rolled up in a hot buckwheat galette, the city\u2019s favourite market snack, to\u00a0fortify yourself before shopping. AL\n\nThe largest market of its kind in the southern hemisphere is a cornerstone of Australia\u2019s gourmet tourist trade, with a vast array of fresh fish and seafood on show \u2013 including oddities like blood cockles and Moreton Bay Bugs \u2013 and sushi, oysters, fish and chips and lobsters served on site. The famous blue-coloured market building, located in Pyrmont to the west of the centre of the city, is set to move next year but only\u00a0by a few hundred metres into a new purpose-built facility. Nic Fildes\n\nEvery Saturday in Athens, the historic anarchist district of Exarchia hosts a farmers\u2019 market, which runs along Kallidromiou under the famous graffitied steps. Musicians play traditional Greek music as sellers flaunt their wares: olive oil, honey and an assortment of fresh fish, herbs and vegetables. While Exarchia has been gentrified over the past few decades, and police tensions have amplified since the\u00a0building of a new metro station nearby, the market remains a touchstone in the neighbourhood: a place where students, anarchists, artists and academics meld with\u00a0tourists. Lucinda Smyth\n\nThis bustling Old Delhi bazaar is a maze of streets and narrow alleys, with the iconic Red Fort at its eastern end. Enormous piles\u00a0of cardamom and cloves, dried fruit and nuts, Kashmiri saffron and every imaginable street food \u2013 curries, roti, samosas and kebabs \u2013 send smells wafting\u00a0through the thick air. Of special note are\u00a0the stalls offering sweets including\u00a0mango-stuffed kulfi, crispy fried\u00a0jalebi and\u00a0Karachi halwa. COE\n\nA favourite of Mexico City chefs, Mercado San Juan is packed with every ingredient you might need, and plenty you don\u2019t. Stalls\u00a0in the downtown market sell everything from pitaya, clams and cacao fruit to dozens of varieties of chilies. It\u2019s also a frequent stop for food-tour groups ogling a selection of more exotic choices, including an array of protein-packed scorpions and crocodile meat. For the less adventurous, there are plenty of wine and\u00a0cheese options. Christine Murray\n\nThe aroma of frying doughnuts and brewing coffee wafts over the market as tourists and locals alike pick through acres of fresh fruit and vegetable stands. The bustling meat, seafood and cheese halls are chock-a-block with people trying tastes of Australian and\u00a0farther-flung specialities. Officially opened in 1878, the \u201cQueen Vic\u201d draws 10 million visitors annually. More than 600 food and\u00a0non-food stalls are open five days a\u00a0week, and there\u2019s a weekly night market focusing on street food, live entertainment and crafts. Brooke Masters\n\nThe 1890s Liberty-style market of the Tuscan port city of Livorno is a vibrant and down-to-earth place to savour torta di\u00a0ceci (chickpea flour flatbread), fresh oysters shucked on the spot or acciughe alla povera (fresh marinated anchovies). Visit speciality food shops (one is devoted entirely to prized Livornese hens\u2019\u00a0eggs), then ogle the stalls showing off the Ligurian Sea\u2019s bounty while\u00a0you plan dinner \u2013 the earlier you arrive, the better. Emiko Davies\n\nFor anyone with a serious sweet tooth, this sprawling, sugar-filled mega-market is worth a detour. Start a market tour with the\u00a0local delicacy ate (ah-tay) \u2013 slow-cooked guava, pear and quince that are served in jellied, chilli-powder-dusted cubes and chunks of crystallised pineapple and pumpkin. Morelianas, one of the most iconic candies, are rich caramel discs that are found next to chocolate balls and jars of\u00a0cajeta, a favoured spread for breads or served over ice cream. COE\n\nThe Ningxia Night Market is relatively small compared to the island\u2019s other sprawling competitors, but it is mighty. Its oyster omelette shop is famous and well worth a\u00a0visit, but if you want to avoid the queues,\u00a0there are plenty of other treats to indulge in. Seek out the deep-fried taro balls, stinky tofu and the unsung hero of desserts: the ice-cream wrap with peanut candy shavings and coriander. Go hungry, leave full. Eleanor Olcott\n\nThousands of eateries comprise this sprawling soul-food mecca, offering\u00a0everything from kimchi dumplings\u00a0to steaming bowls of bibimbap\u00a0and noodles that are perfect for slurping, grilled meat and mung-bean pancakes. Pull up a plastic\u00a0stool in the food court and absorb the energy of the many hawkers \u2013 and a sea of voracious eaters savouring local delicacies. The market features an\u00a0area dedicated to clothing and\u00a0home goods\u00a0as well, and it\u2019s the ideal place to\u00a0buy\u00a0an exquisite silk hanbok (traditional\u00a0Korean dress). COE\n\nA highlight of the New York summer is\u00a0the\u00a0Queens Night Market, a nocturnal\u00a0festival attracting more than 60\u00a0independent food and art vendors. Located\u00a0in Flushing, it begins in April, and\u00a0continues until October. From early evening until midnight, visitors can sample\u00a0street food from across the globe, and unlike many glossy food-stall markets, the food vendor prices are capped at $6. Check out the Trinidadian bake and shark\u00a0from Caribbean Street Eats or curry crab\u00a0at Trini Treats, or the arepa sampler at Arepalicious. Madison Darbyshire\n\nA stroll down the Mercado 20 de Noviembre\u2019s \u201csmoke corridor\u201d is an immersive experience. The market itself is\u00a0famed for stalls selling tlayudas \u2013 giant,\u00a0crispy tortillas with beans, local cheese, and\u00a0other toppings. In its dark,\u00a0sweltering smoke passage, sellers display an assortment of meats they will\u00a0chargrill and put into a tortilla for you.\u00a0A\u00a0word of warning: you might take the\u00a0smell with you.

The 82-year-old was sentenced in November to 17 and a half years in jail in a ruling the judge said was designed to act as a \u201cdeterrent\u201d. Lim\u2019s defence lawyer has appealed, citing his wheelchair-bound client\u2019s age and poor health.\n\nThe tough sentencing exemplifies how Singapore has tried to crack down on dodgy dealing in its commodities market. It has launched initiatives aimed at digitising the documentation that is the backbone of the commodities market, while encouraging wider information sharing among market players to prevent fraud.\n\n\u201cSingapore has realised they need to step up and rebuild some credibility,\u201d said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert, founding partner of Lambert Commodities, a consultancy. \u201cThey are taking these scandals more seriously.\u201d\n\nSingapore owes its reputation as a global commodities hub to its position on sea lanes that connect China with global markets, along with its government\u2019s business-friendly approach.\n\nGlobal trading houses including Trafigura, Vitol Group, Gunvor and Mercuria all have bases in the city, which is Asia\u2019s largest oil trading hub and one of the largest in the world for trading agricultural commodities. The city state has also set its sights on becoming a hub for rapidly growing carbon trading.\n\nIts need to set itself apart has become more acute after Dubai\u2019s rapid rise as a commodities trading hub, especially for Russian goods under sanctions by western governments.\n\n\u201cThe long arc of global history is full of stories of ports that have flourished and thrived for decades, only to decline amidst changing circumstances,\u201d said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong during an event at Singapore\u2019s mega Tuas Port project in October. \u201cThe lesson is that we cannot be complacent.\u201d\n\nThe Lim case, along with several others in Singapore, came to light in 2020, when commodity prices slumped at the outbreak of the pandemic. Lim\u2019s company, Hin Leong, collapsed in April 2020 and he admitted hiding $800mn in losses from creditors, which included some of the world\u2019s biggest banks.\n\nHis was the largest of several trading houses in the city state that imploded that year. Others included the oil dealer ZenRock and Agritrade International, a trader accused of fraud by its lenders. Hontop Energy, the trading arm of a Shandong-based refiner, went into receivership and was accused by its biggest lender of \u201csuspicious transactions\u201d.\n\nA common theme of the scandals was dubious paperwork, used to secure credit from financial institutions in order to hide losses and make leveraged bets on commodity prices. Banks were willing to lend to the traders in expectation of chunky fees.\n\n\u201cPaper documents have always been the Achilles heel of international trade,\u201d said Baldev Bhinder, managing director of Blackstone & Gold, a specialist energy and commodities law firm in Singapore.\n\nLim was found guilty of encouraging his executives to forge two documents that purported to be oil sales contracts, which led to HSBC disbursing nearly $112mn to the company.\n\nAt the time of its collapse, Hin Leong owed $3.85bn. HSBC had the biggest exposure at $600mn, followed by ABN Amro at $300mn, while French lender Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale had lent the company $240mn. Singaporean banks \u2014 DBS Group, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank \u2014 had exposures worth $680mn.\n\nHSBC also lent $49mn to ZenRock, but reported the collapsed trader to Singaporean police over what it described as \u201cdishonest practices\u201d.\n\nAgritrade was found to have been granted $1.5bn of credit from 26 lenders. Its creditors accused the business of fraud through issuing duplicate bills of lading \u2014 the legal documents issued by transportation companies to shippers \u2014 to multiple banks as security against loans.\n\n\u201cProsecutors are taking a more proactive approach,\u201d said Kit Smith, a UK-based lawyer specialising in global fraud and trade disputes at Keidan Harrison. \u201cThere is a push to be more stringent on big-ticket frauds and make examples of the perpetrators.\u201d\n\nEnterprise Singapore, the government agency charged with promoting business, said there was \u201czero tolerance for fraudulent activities in Singapore\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe fraud cases seen in the commodities trading sector in the past have been attributed to weak disclosure practices and internal controls among a minority of the trading companies,\u201d it said in a statement to the Financial Times.\n\n\u201cWhen Singapore authorities discover financial fraud in the trading sector, we will take immediate action to bring perpetrators to task as seen in the case of Hin Leong.\u201d\n\nThe government has also launched a series of initiatives in recent years aimed at impeding fraudsters\u2019 ability to rip-off creditors.\n\nAmong them is a trade finance registry to prevent the same asset being pledged as a security for more than one loan to different institutions. The government has also tried to encourage traders to move away from paper documentation, instead exchanging digital records on a public blockchain to reduce forgeries.\n\nWhile Lambert said Singapore was \u201craising the stakes in terms of compliance and regulatory requirements\u201d, he added that regulators should have been firmer in previous accounting scandals.\n\nThe scandals have also forced banks to take a much more stringent approach to lending to commodity traders. Several lenders announced they were pulling out of the market in 2020.\n\n\u201cBanks are approaching their customers with a great deal more vigilance now, which is a good thing, but it has meant smaller traders are finding it harder to attract financing,\u201d said Bhinder.\n\n\u201cLim\u2019s sentencing closes a chapter for Singapore and the commodities trading market \u2014 it has been a learning experience for everyone.\u201d", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b10c85a9-98e9-4b5e-9e5a-db044044f6f3"}, {"title": "Singapore oil trader sentenced to 17 years for \u2018cheating\u2019 HSBC over $112mn", "description": "Octogenarian Lim Oon Kuin handed long jail term as \u2018deterrent\u2019 in city-state\u2019s fight against commodity trading corruption ", "author": "Owen Walker", "published_date": "2024-11-18T09:56:13.852Z", "content": "An octogenarian oil trader has been given a 17-and-a-half-year jail sentence in Singapore for defrauding HSBC, in a long-running case that sent shockwaves through the city-state\u2019s commodity trading sector.\n\nLim Oon Kuin, known as OK Lim and once one of Singapore\u2019s richest men, was sentenced on Monday after being convicted in May of \u201ccheating\u201d HSBC and abetting forgery.

Lim attended court hearings in a wheelchair.\n\nBloomberg reported that Singh had appealed on behalf of his client and Lim would not begin his sentence until after the appeal hearing.\n\nThe case had centred on allegations that Hin Leong had been hiding losses from trading in futures markets and selling off oil inventories already pledged as collateral for loans.\n\nLim was originally charged in 2020 after confessing to hiding $800mn in losses from creditors \u2014 including HSBC and Singapore\u2019s biggest lender DBS \u2014 and directing the company\u2019s finance department not to disclose the losses.\n\nHe was initially hit with 130 criminal charges involving hundreds of millions of dollars, but was eventually tried on just three.\n\nSingapore\u2019s pivotal position on global shipping lanes connecting China with global markets, as well as its stability and low corporate tax rates, have made it one of the most important global hubs for commodities trading.\n\nBut a spate of scandals in the market throughout the 2010s raised questions about Singapore\u2019s ability to rein in its trading houses. Several cases centred around fraud and forged documents. Paper trails make up the backbone of the industry.\n\nWith a single delivery truck, Lim founded Hin Leong in 1963 as an oil distributor. Over the decades, the family business grew to become Singapore\u2019s largest independent oil trader and a major supplier of shipping fuel.\n\nBut the collapse in the oil market in 2020 sent his empire into a tailspin. Lim filed for bankruptcy last month and agreed to pay S$4.5bn (US$3.3bn) to liquidators and creditor HSBC to settle long-running civil lawsuits.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b5519aad-3849-45b1-941f-cf4c6732e2a2"}, {"title": "Singapore sets out AI\u2019s role in retooling the city-state\u2019s economy", "description": "Josephine Teo, digital development minister, explains how the country is addressing the technology\u2019s promise and risks", "author": "John Doe", "published_date": "2024-11-14T05:00:41.616Z", "content": "The Financial Times\u2019 Future of AI summit opened on November 6 with Josephine Teo, Singapore\u2019s minister for digital development and information, talking to the FT\u2019s analysis editor Geoff Dyer about Singapore\u2019s AI strategy.

I am writing this week\u2019s newsletter from Bangkok, where I am attending an annual meeting with colleagues from across the region.\n\nI was posted here as an editor about a decade ago, and it\u2019s always a pleasure to come back, but the positioning of Thailand \u2014 and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as a whole \u2014 has shifted significantly, especially since tensions between the US and China started to heat up around 2018.\n\nGetting caught between great power rivals like this is something smaller nations seek to avoid, and members of Asean are no exception. But even when countries do get drawn into these power plays, it is not always in a negative way, such as Vietnam attracting substantial investments and emerging as a major manufacturing hub of various tech products during this period.\n\nAs we feature in this edition of the newsletter, Singapore has enjoyed a sharp rise up the global ranking of start-up ecosystems, as investment in so-called deep tech surged against a backdrop of Sino-American tensions. Cambodia, meanwhile, is becoming a battleground between China and Japan, a key US ally, in terms of telecom infrastructure building, which could turn into a positive for local users as increased competition brings better services at lower prices.\n\nOf course, anyone can find themselves in the crossfire of the US-China rivalry, as our Taipei colleagues remind us with their scoop this week about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) halting shipments to certain customers to avoid inadvertently violating US export controls on China.\n\nNo matter who is elected president in the US next week \u2014 Kamala Harris or Donald Trump \u2014 other countries will continue having to navigate the Washington-Beijing rivalry with all its various consequences.\n\nTSMC, the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, has stopped shipping to at least two chip developers\u00a0over suspicions they were trying to circumvent US export controls on China\u2019s Huawei Technologies, Nikkei Asia\u2019s tech correspondents Cheng Ting-Fang\u00a0and Lauly Li\u00a0reported in this exclusive story from Taipei.\n\nThe two developers placed orders for chips made with 7-nanometre process technology, which TSMC has been using for mass production since 2018. Washington has been restricting chipmaking equipment containing American technology from being used to make chips of 14nm or better for China without an export license. TSMC\u2019s most advanced commercial products are the 3-nm processor chips used for Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 series.\n\nEnforcing Washington\u2019s export controls is far from straightforward, as chip developers could use layers of non-Chinese shell companies to camouflage their orders, according to sources.\n\nTSMC reiterated to Nikkei Asia that it has not supplied Huawei since mid-September 2020 in compliance with the US export restrictions.\n\nSamsung Electronics is struggling to hold on to its crown as the world\u2019s top-selling smartphone maker, write the Financial Times\u2019 Song Jung-a\u00a0and Christian Davies.\n\nThe South Korean tech giant was the only one of the top five global smartphone makers to experience falling shipments\u00a0in the third quarter of this year, losing market share to US rival Apple and Chinese contenders offering slick new foldable devices.\n\nResearch group TechInsights expects Apple\u2019s new generative artificial intelligence features to help power the US company past Samsung next year.\n\nSamsung once pioneered foldable devices but ceded the top spot earlier this year to Chinese rival Huawei, which had a 27.5 per cent share of the foldables market in the second quarter, compared with Samsung\u2019s 16.4 per cent, according to IDC.\n\nThe company\u2019s smartphone struggles come at a critical point. It has been hit by a series of failures at its semiconductor division, which accounts for 60 per cent of Samsung\u2019s operating profit.\n\n\u201cDeep tech\u201d endeavours in Singapore are getting a boost\u00a0amid the ever-intensifying Sino-American tech tensions. Nikkei Asia\u2019s Tsubasa Suruga\u00a0reports that investment in this field \u2014 which is based on scientific research with potentially large social impacts like chips, robotics and medicine \u2014 was up 31 per cent by volume last year, even as overall start-up investment dropped 20 per cent.\n\nBased on data by DealStreetAsia and Enterprise Singapore, deep tech accounted for 25 per cent of the total deal value, up from 17 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe boost in deep tech investment helped push the city-state\u2019s global start-up ecosystem ranking to seventh this year, up from 18th just two years ago, and leapfrogging all other Asian hubs, including Beijing, Seoul and Tokyo, according to US-based research company Startup Genome.\n\nInvestors \u2014 who are mostly local or American, but also from Taiwan, Japan, France and Malaysia \u2014 say deep tech tends to remain under the radar due to the complex technology and expertise involved, but it is gaining importance amid the US-China trade war and supply chain shifts.\n\nA Japanese tech consortium, with help from government subsidies, is challenging the Chinese dominance in the 5G market. The initial battleground is Cambodia, an ostensibly neutral country that has shown itself to be a staunch ally to Beijing, according to an exclusive report by Nikkei\u2019s Kiu Sugano, Shiho Miyajima\u00a0and Kyoko Hariya.\n\nOrex Sai, a joint venture between NTT DoCoMo and NEC, will build a 4G network at a large commercial complex in the south-east Asian country by March, which will serve as a platform for transitioning to 5G in the future.\n\nCambodia\u2019s telecom network, like many around the world, is reliant on equipment from Huawei Technologies. The Chinese company and its compatriot ZTE together control more than 40 per cent of the global market for 5G base stations, British research company Omdia says. Japanese players as a whole hold about 3 per cent.\n\nFor this Cambodia project, Tokyo is applying a new aid policy that applies government assistance proactively rather than waiting for a request from a recipient country. The development co-operation charter revised last year, which stresses Japanese aid money \u201cdoes not involve debt traps or economic coercion, and that does not undermine the independence and sustainability of developing countries\u201d, will also be applied to the project.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fb80b67d-87b6-4aec-af1f-e656d71afd28"}, {"title": "Addison Lee to be bought by Singapore-listed group in \u00a3269mn deal", "description": "UK private-hire taxi company is due to undergo its third change of ownership in just over a decade ", "author": "Maxine Kelly", "published_date": "2024-10-23T20:23:51.117Z", "content": "Addison Lee, the UK-based private-hire taxi and courier company, has agreed to be bought by Singapore-listed transport conglomerate ComfortDelGro in a\u00a0deal valuing the business\u00a0at \u00a3269.1mn.\n\nComfortDelGro, a multinational company with operations ranging from taxis to rail and London buses, is buying Addison Lee from a consortium led by chief executive Liam Griffin and Cheyne Capital.\n\nOn Wednesday ComfortDelGro said the acquisition, to be done through its UK subsidiary CityFleet Networks, would enable it to expand into the \u201cpremium mobility segment\u201d and help its shift towards clean energy vehicles.\n\nThe combined group\u2019s taxi and private hire network will consist of more than 34,000 vehicles globally upon completion of the deal.\n\nThe transaction marks the third change of ownership in just over a decade for Addison Lee, as the London taxi market has been disrupted by ride-hailing apps such as Uber, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nPrivate equity group Carlyle bought the business from the Griffin family, Addison Lee\u2019s founders, for \u00a3300mn in 2013.

During his lifetime, Lee Kuan Yew had repeatedly stated that once his children had moved out of the family home, the property should be demolished to avoid it becoming a shrine to himself. Lee Hsien Yang wanted his wishes enforced, but other family members disagreed.\n\nIn response to inquiries over the asylum move this week, the Singapore authorities released a 5,000-word statement, repeating claims that Lee Suet Fern had tampered with the final draft of Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s will in order to reinstate a \u201cdemolition clause\u201d regarding 38 Oxley Road and also carve out a larger portion of the estate for her husband.\n\nLee Wei Ling, an accomplished doctor who established the National Neuroscience Institute in the former British colony, diagnosed herself with progressive supranuclear palsy in 2020.\n\nHer death was announced by Lee Hsien Yang on Facebook, with her younger brother immediately calling afresh for the demolition of 38 Oxley Road.\n\nLee Hsien Loong, who stepped aside as prime minister earlier this year but who remains a senior minister, responded on Facebook, saying: \u201cI held nothing against Ling, and continued to do whatever I could to ensure her welfare,\u201d adding that she was \u201cfiercely loyal to friends, sympathised instinctively with the underdog, and would mobilise actively to do something when she saw unfairness, or suspected wrongdoing\u201d.\n\nIn seeking political asylum in Britain, Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern are understood to have successfully argued that their brother Lee Hsien Loong has used the organs of state against their wing of the family to block any chance that their son, Li Shengwu, might enter politics in Singapore and one day rise to the position of prime minister.\n\nLi Shengwu, an economist who has adopted a different English spelling of the family name, was recently granted tenure at Harvard University, where he is a professor. He has denied having any interest in pursuing a political career, but nevertheless considers himself to be exiled from the city-state.\n\nSingapore\u2019s legal system, particularly its libel laws frequently used by Lee Kuan Yew and his successors, has long made life difficult for the political opponents of the Singapore government and for the media.\n\nIn its statement, the Singapore government insisted Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern, along with their son, \u201care and have always been free to return to Singapore\u201d, adding that the city state\u2019s judiciary is impartial and makes decisions independently.\n\nIt added: \u201cAs the government has stated on many occasions, in parliament and elsewhere, senior minister Lee Hsien Loong has long recused himself on all matters relating to 38 Oxley Road,\u201d adding that while Lee Kuan Yew \u201cpreferred demolition, he was also willing to consider other options such as refurbishing and redesigning the interior\u201d.\n\nPosting on Facebook, Lee Hsien Yang said: \u201cIn 2017, my sister Wei Ling and I declared, \u2018We do not trust Hsien Loong as a brother or as a leader.\u2019 We stated that we feared the abuse of the organs of the Singapore state against us and against my family. Because of that risk, I was unable to attend Wei Ling\u2019s funeral.\u201d\n\nHe said the Singapore government\u2019s attacks against him were a matter of public record. \u201cOn the basis of these facts, the UK has determined that I face a well-founded risk of persecution, and cannot safely return to Singapore.\u201d\n\nWhile the figures are low compared with more troubled parts of the world, data from the UN refugee agency UNHCR shows a marked rise in the number of Singapore nationals seeking asylum elsewhere, a trend that Singapore\u2019s critics put down to the authoritarian nature of the city-state\u2019s government.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8a3562c9-0f8f-4451-b190-a52b487d25e3"}, {"title": "Which luxury train crew are you?", "description": "From the Venice Simplon-Orient\u2011Express to The Ghan Expedition, it\u2019s never been easier, or chicer, to travel by rail.

A very Belmond bonus: the onboard Dior Spa (a carriage with two treatment rooms).\n\nBelmond has teased that Bangkok will be back on the agenda by next year; meanwhile, the E&OE traces two itineraries in and out of\u00a0Singapore. \u201cWild Malaysia\u201d takes you variously hiking, e-biking, caving and tiger-spotting (if you\u2019re lucky) in Merapoh and Taman Negara National Park. \u201cEssence of Malaysia\u201d is about street-food tasting, art tours of George Town (the bustling ex-colonial capital of Penang), and speed-boating off\u00a0the beaches of Langkawi.\n\nSome of us think the most exciting aspect of the E&OE reboot is resident chef Andr\u00e9 Chiang, whose eponymous restaurant in Singapore racked up multiple Michelin stars and best-in-Asia accolades before closing in 2018. Onboard, he marries and reinterprets French and south-east Asian traditions: think steaming bowls of laksa bouillabaisse and spicy cacao ganache.\n\nJungle-trekking and sea spray by day don\u2019t preclude de rigueur evening gloss.

Not that those will be anything to sneeze at, designed by Milanese darlings Dimore Studio with mirrored walls, groovy \u201960s- and \u201970s-inspired textiles and scads of Gio Ponti, Osvaldo Borsani and Gae Aulenti-inspired flourishes everywhere.\n\nThe premium is on place, connecting destinations previously unserviced by luxury sleeper train, from Montalcino in southern Tuscany to Maratea and Matera in Basilicata, Monferrato in Piedmont (for truffles and Nebbiolo), and even Sicily. The excursions will include tastings, private palazzi, world heritage sites and aperitivi in five-star partner hotels,\u00a0such as Maratea\u2019s lovely Santavenere, along the way.\n\nA waves-making name was needed, and they sure tapped one: Heinz Beck, the thrice Michelin-starred founder of the Order of The Knights of Italian Cuisine, whose La Pergola in Rome remains one of\u00a0Italy\u2019s premier gourmet destinations. La\u00a0Dolce Vita has also partnered with Vinitaly to have exclusive access to award-winning vintages, representing northern, central and southern Italy and personally selected by Beck, on the carte.\n\nHigh Italian glamour: from floor-length La\u00a0DoubleJ printed frocks to wide-lapelled jackets from Giuliva Heritage or\u00a0Cifonelli.

Red carpets, fuchsia silk canopies and musicians and dancers greet guests at arrival stations. There are\u00a0two restaurants, a\u00a0bar and games lounge, and even a\u00a0boutique. Palette- and materials-wise, more is more is always more, with just a\u00a0bit extra for good measure.\n\nThe various three- to six-night itineraries are multi-state journeys that connect all-star destinations in northern and central India; the train trundles along old\u00a0state-railway lines by night, calling in\u00a0by day at Mehrangarh Fort, Orchha, Ranthambore (whence India\u2019s most famous tiger safaris), the Taj Mahal or\u00a0the\u00a0temples at Khajuraho. Caravans and the occasional vintage limousine ferry\u00a0guests to and from sites, or to cocktails and dinner at heritage palace hotels along the route.\n\nGenerally good, if with less wow factor than on comparable trains elsewhere (perhaps it\u2019s time for state owners IRCTC to consider luring a Garima Arora or Gaggan Anand aboard?).

Hong Kong would then account for $3.2tn out of the total $17.1tn in global offshore wealth assets, compared with $3.1tn for Switzerland and $2.5tn for Singapore, according to Boston Consulting Group estimates.\n\nIn the five years to 2028, Hong Kong\u2019s cross-border wealth market is on track to grow by 6 per cent a year in terms of assets, compared with 3.6 per cent in Switzerland and 8.5 per cent in Singapore.\n\n\u201cSwitzerland will always be our competitor, but we are not afraid,\u201d says Jason Fong, a 27-year banking and asset management veteran who has been tasked by the Hong Kong government with attracting family offices to the Chinese territory. \u201cThey are crumbling and we are in a very advantageous situation.\u201d\n\nMuch has changed since the early 18th century, when France\u2019s Catholic kings tapped the banks of Geneva for funds, but tried to conceal their dealings with the city\u2019s Huguenot financiers, fearing a sectarian backlash at home. An edict from the Great Council of Geneva in 1713 prohibited bankers from sharing client registers with the authorities.\n\nGeneva\u2019s commitment to banking discretion helped elevate it into a European financial powerhouse and drew in Swiss mercenary soldiers who were looking to safeguard their money made from fighting abroad. \u201cThe Swiss laid the foundation for today\u2019s global wealth management model,\u201d says Iqbal Khan, co-head of wealth management at UBS. \u201cIts heritage comes from the duty of care for others\u2019 property and the principle of self-control.\u201d\n\nSecrecy became enshrined in Swiss legislation with a 1934 banking law, which set out that bankers who disclosed client information could be jailed. Initially, European Jews fleeing persecution set up Swiss bank accounts to protect their valuables, but later such accounts were favoured by Nazis to store their looted wealth. A Swiss bank account soon became the financial product of choice for the rich who did not want too much attention on their fortunes\u2019 sources.\n\nThis commitment to clandestine banking attracted despots and oligarchs throughout the 20th century, while tax-evading lawyers and country doctors from neighbouring European countries made up a large proportion of Swiss private banks\u2019 clients. It was in the middle of the 20th century that Swiss bankers attracted the nickname of the \u201cgnomes of Zurich\u201d from British politicians for their ability to hoard heaps of gold in underground vaults. It was soon regarded as a badge of honour. Swiss bankers took to answering calls from British colleagues by saying: \u201cHello, gnome speaking.\u201d\n\nMore recently, though, under pressure from tax authorities around the world following a series of high-profile scandals over the flows of illicit money, Switzerland has acquiesced to demands for greater transparency around its banking sector.\n\nIn 2017, it signed up to the international automatic exchange of information standard, which requires Swiss financial institutions to share details on their clients with the countries where they are tax resident. More than 100 countries are signed up to the same standard, which has all but killed off Switzerland\u2019s allure for tax evaders.\n\nThe final blow for Swiss banking discretion came two years ago with the Suisse Secrets scandal, where documents detailing the accounts of 30,000 Credit Suisse clients were leaked to a consortium of international media outlets. Among those named in the cache of documents \u2014 which dated back to the 1940s \u2014 were war criminals, autocrats, oligarchs, drug smugglers and human traffickers.\n\nThe collapse of Credit Suisse prompted the Swiss government to devise a series of proposals to bolster the banking system, including giving more power to the domestic financial regulator and potentially increasing UBS\u2019s capital requirements. Executives in Zurich fear that if the new measures are too draconian, they could ultimately put their banks at a disadvantage to their foreign rivals.\n\n\u201cFinancial centres like Hong Kong, Singapore and the US are aggressively competing, and making great progress, for the offshore wealth management crown that Switzerland holds today,\u201d UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti said in June. \u201cForeign financial centres would benefit if Switzerland were to restrict its ability to maintain a leading presence abroad.\u201d\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s reputation for neutrality on the world stage has proved enticing over the decades for the global and mobile rich, especially in times of rising geopolitical tension. Yet this, too, is being tested. The decision by Switzerland following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine to sign up to the US and EU sanctions regimes has led to questions from clients about whether the country is still an impartial player.\n\nA recent report from the Swiss Bankers Association lobby group identified Switzerland\u2019s adherence to international sanctions regimes as the top geopolitical risk facing the country\u2019s wealth managers. The immediate effect of implementing sanctions was Swiss banks pulling out of Russia and jettisoning Russian clients, many of whom switched their offshore bank accounts to the Middle East.\n\nJimmy Lee, head of Asia-Pacific at Julius Baer, has run several western banks\u2019 Singapore and Hong Kong operations over the past three decades. He says he is often asked by clients whether Switzerland is still neutral. \u201cWe explain to them that Ukraine is at the doorstep of Switzerland and they are taking a stance,\u201d he says. \u201cIf your neighbour\u2019s house is on fire, you cannot stay neutral.\u201d\n\nThe Ukraine war has brought Switzerland closer to Nato, with a recent paper commissioned by the country\u2019s defence ministry suggesting Swiss troops could co-operate in military manoeuvres with other states for the first time since 1515.\n\nAs Switzerland grapples with its five-century-old commitment to neutrality, rival wealth management hubs have sought to project their own credentials as non-partisan places to do business. \u201cSome of these Asian wealth hubs played their hand extremely well,\u201d says a Swiss bank executive. \u201cThey managed to position themselves as neutral, although they all adopted the US sanctions just like we did.\u201d\n\nThe story of how Asia\u2019s two main financial entrep\u00f4ts copied the Swiss white-glove model of wealth management and ended up outpacing their European rival could be seen as a historical quirk \u2014 a byproduct of the supercharged growth in Asian wealth in the 21st century. But, in Singapore\u2019s case, it was more by design. It was on a trip to Zurich in 1967, two years after Singapore\u2019s independence from Malaysia, that Lee Kuan Yew set upon the idea of transforming the nation he had founded into Asia\u2019s financial hub. Lee, the country\u2019s first prime minister, had seen the way Switzerland, a small country with few natural resources and surrounded by powerful neighbours, had established itself over several centuries as the global centre of offshore banking and wealth management.\n\nSingapore\u2019s government followed Switzerland\u2019s lead in designing its tax system to attract rich foreigners looking for a base to park their wealth, while also encouraging Swiss private banks to set up shop. \u201cWe have\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009deliberately encouraged the development of Singapore as a financial centre,\u201d Lee said on a subsequent trip to Zurich in 1971 while speaking at a reception at the Union Bank of Switzerland. \u201cSingapore sets out to be to south-east Asia what Switzerland is to Europe \u2014 a money and gold market.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason for the rise of Hong Kong and Singapore as offshore wealth hubs is down to demographics and how quickly a wealthy upper class has emerged in Asia in recent decades. Mainland China is now home to 6mn millionaires, the second-highest number behind the US. This weight of money funnelling into Hong Kong from mainland China, which accounts for just under half of the cross-border money flowing into Hong Kong\u2019s wealth managers, according to McKinsey, has driven its rapid growth \u2014 even as that of Switzerland and Singapore, to a lesser extent, has slowed.\n\nThis proximity is one of the main reasons UBS recently announced it would move its local headquarters to a tower sitting on top of the West Kowloon train terminus. The new development is designed to connect Hong Kong by high-speed rail to the surrounding Greater Bay Area, the largest and most populated urban area in the world.\n\nBy contrast, Singapore acts more like an entry point for global investors into south-east, and increasingly, north Asia. China is expected to account for about 30 per cent of wealth inflows into the city state over the next five years, with Hong Kong and Taiwan the next biggest markets.\n\nA sign of Hong Kong and Singapore\u2019s growing importance as offshore wealth hubs is the booming market for family offices. These small, private companies are set up to manage the wealth of one or maybe a handful of wealthy families, providing a full suite of services, from tax and succession planning to investing and philanthropy. Both Hong Kong and Singapore are on course to report record numbers of launches this year. There were 50 family offices operating in Singapore in 2018, but that has ballooned to 1,650 today. Hong Kong, meanwhile, has more than 2,700.\n\nThe new launches are typically serving families in other Asian countries looking to diversify where their wealth is managed, transferring a large chunk from their domestic market to meet their global interests or give them options if things get uncomfortable at home. Singapore, in particular, is attracting family office branches from further afield. \u201cSome are coming from the Middle East and Europe,\u201d says Jin Yee Young, co-head of Asia-Pacific wealth management at UBS, who runs the Singapore business. \u201cThey see Singapore as a window to the region. They are very established, some are even multigenerational family offices, and they are looking to tap into investments in the region.\u201d\n\nWhen Hong Kong and Singapore were starting to establish their wealth management sectors, they looked to the Swiss model for inspiration. Yet for a long time, the clients had vastly different needs. \u201cWhen I started in private banking in the 1990s, it was about the private individual and their needs,\u201d says Amy Lo, the other co-head of UBS\u2019s Apac wealth business, who runs the Hong Kong operation. \u201cAs things have globalised, 70 per cent of our clients are entrepreneurs and now it is much more about succession planning, looking after their businesses, philanthropy and doing good for society.\u201d\n\nThe authorities in Singapore and Hong Kong are working on ways to improve the local talent pools to ensure they can meet evolving client needs. \u201cWhenever I go to the Asian international financial centres, the general discussion is always on how to increase the number of people who are interested in working in wealth management,\u201d says Pradelli of EFG. \u201cTalent is very important. While we traditionally have a strong talent base for our industry in Switzerland, the pipeline of talent in Asian financial centres is strong and improving, but still quite scarce.\u201d\n\nSingapore has had an influx of money from China and Hong Kong in recent years, as rich individuals moved their wealth from what they regard as an increasingly authoritarian Chinese state. But those inflows culminated in a S$3bn ($2.34bn) scandal last year, in which 10 Chinese nationals were convicted of money laundering following Singapore\u2019s biggest investigation into online gambling in Asia. It involved island-wide raids and the seizure of gold bars, expensive wines, crypto assets, designer handbags and luxury cars. Banks in Singapore have responded by heightening scrutiny of foreign customers and intensifying efforts to identify sources of wealth, leading to delays in onboarding new customers.\n\nWhile some critics have suggested the episode highlighted lax controls in Singapore\u2019s burgeoning family office sector, Marco Pagliara, head of emerging markets at Deutsche Bank\u2019s private bank, attributes it more to growing pains that the local regulator responded to.\n\n\u201cThere was a phase where there was a significant flow coming from north Asia \u2014 on the back of that there was correction that needed to be implemented. They did it quite swiftly,\u201d says Pagliara. \u201cSingapore is focused on running a very tight and organised ship with the way they manage their financial centre.\u201d\n\nThis month, the Singaporean government published a package of recommendations to tighten anti-money-laundering rules in the city state, including improving information sharing between departments and giving prosecutors stronger powers. \u201cWe continually engage the industry and stakeholders to ensure that our framework remains robust against illegitimate wealth and welcoming of legitimate businesses and investors,\u201d said the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country\u2019s financial regulator.\n\nThough their home market has been losing ground, Switzerland\u2019s wealth managers are seeking to capitalise on the growth in Asia by building on the cachet associated with being a Swiss bank. \u201cSwissness stands for high quality, trust and credibility,\u201d says UBS\u2019s Khan, who recently relocated to Hong Kong to run the bank\u2019s Asia-Pacific business. \u201cBut that\u2019s not enough in today\u2019s world. You need to have cultural heritage as well.\u201d\n\nKhan, who will split his time between Hong Kong and Singapore, had previously been the sole head of UBS\u2019s wealth management business and was based in Zurich. But he is one of several senior executives at European wealth managers who have relocated to Asia as they target the region for growth. Asia\u2019s biggest banks were mostly late to prioritise developing their own wealth management businesses and trail far behind their longer established competitors from Europe and the US. But they are starting to catch up.\n\nThe Swiss banks have recognised that although their country\u2019s reputation as the world\u2019s centre for wealth management has taken a hit in recent years, they can still dominate in rival financial hubs.\n\nThis article is part of FT Wealth, a section providing in-depth coverage of philanthropy, entrepreneurs, family offices, as well as alternative and impact investment", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b5b980fc-de63-4e07-8dd5-9a8385baec4a"}, {"title": "Singapore charges billionaire in gifts scandal involving ex-transport minister", "description": "Ong Beng Seng accused of abetting S Iswaran who was sentenced to a year in prison this week", "author": "A.

Ong did not enter a plea, local media reported.\n\nThe indictment against Ong comes one day after Iswaran was sentenced to a one-year jail term for accepting gifts valued at more than $300,000 and obstructing justice. He became the first Singaporean minister to be imprisoned in nearly 50 years.\n\nIswaran was accused of accepting gifts from Ong, who owns the rights to the Singapore Grand Prix, at a time when he had official dealings with the tycoon. As transport minister, Iswaran was the most senior government official negotiating with Ong\u2019s company on matters related to the Formula One race in Singapore.\n\nIswaran pleaded guilty last month to five charges, including four counts of obtaining valuable items and one of obstruction of justice. He resigned as transport minister earlier this year after he was formally charged.\n\nThe charges against Ong correspond to two of the charges to which Iswaran pleaded guilty, the AGC said.\n\nIswaran had initially faced 35 charges, though prosecutors proceeded with only five at the start of the trial. Most of the charges related to gifts from Ong, including tickets to English Premier League football matches, the Singapore F1 race, and plays including Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Hamilton and Kinky Boots as well as a business-class flight from Doha to Singapore in 2022.\n\nOng, a Malaysian citizen, was first arrested in July 2023 and released on bail. He is the majority owner of Singapore GP Pte, the promoter for the F1 race in Singapore. He is also the founder of Hotel Properties, which has brands including the Four Seasons and InterContinental in its property portfolio.\n\nThe Ong family also has a majority stake in the British luxury handbag maker Mulberry.\n\nIswaran was also charged with receiving gifts, including whisky and a Brompton T Line bicycle, from another businessman, Lum Kok Seng. Lum is the managing director of Lum Chang Holdings, a construction firm. He will not be charged, the AGC said on Friday.\n\nA lawyer for Ong declined to comment.\n\nThe scandal has come at a sensitive time for Singapore, which prides itself on its reputation for clean governance and transparency. Ministers in the Asian financial hub are among the highest paid in the world, earning about S$1mn (US$771,000) a year in part to discourage corruption.\n\nSingapore is set to hold elections next year, the first under new Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who took office in May. The ruling People\u2019s Action party \u2014 which has governed the city-state since independence in 1965 \u2014 is expected to win, but its reputation has taken a hit from a series of scandals, including the corruption allegations against Iswaran.\n\nIn a statement following Iswaran\u2019s sentencing this week, Wong said he and his team would uphold the highest standards of integrity. \u201cOur system ensures that our public officers are accountable, and no one is beyond scrutiny or above the law,\u201d he said.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c59028c7-9f2f-41c8-b525-d45adb7c5880"}, {"title": "How Singapore became a magnet for independent jewellers", "description": "A wealthy local clientele looking for one-off designs has boosted the sector, and now word is spreading internationally", "author": "Francesca Fearon", "published_date": "2024-10-04T03:00:32.713Z", "content": "In a quiet street opposite Singapore\u2019s Peranakan Museum, in a white art deco building, is the boutique of Singapore jeweller State Property. The business is owned by husband-and-wife team Afzal Imram, an industrial designer, and Central Saint Martins-trained jeweller Ruiyin Lin. They founded it as a local fine-jewellery brand, and it is one of the few with an international profile, thanks to expansion into North America.\n\nAcross town, in a high-rise block, is the very discreet showroom of Simone Jewels, which was established 18 years ago by Malaysian-born Simone Ng. In 2020, she became the first Singapore jeweller to be stocked in London department store Harrods and has retail clients in Paris and the US.\n\nShe is better known in Singapore and around the region, though, for her one-of-a-kind artistic high jewellery. Her colourful masterpieces are inspired by her love of history and architecture \u2014 currently the palaces of Istanbul \u2014 and, last year, she debuted a gender-neutral collection called Tattoo with symbol-shaped pendants and cocktail rings.\n\nAnd what they all show is that Singapore has no shortage of creativity or high-spending clients to support a local jewellery industry \u2014 even though the island state is not a big manufacturer, like Hong Kong or Bangkok.\n\n\u201cMost things in Asia are generally mass-produced and creating one-in-the-world pieces is one of the reasons why we started the brand,\u201d says Ng. \u201cIn Singapore, customers are well-versed and sophisticated in their jewellery purchases.\u201d\n\nThe island may be small, but there are different types of jewellery markets, Ng explains. \u201cSome like [their jewellery] simple, some like it large and luxurious, and others would only buy into luxury brands,\u201d she says.\n\nThe city is the major shopping destination for the region, with many international luxury brands in the malls lining Orchard Road. Ng estimates 45 per cent of clients for her artistic masterpieces and bespoke designs are from elsewhere in south-east Asia, while 50 per cent are Singaporean and 5 per cent are from the rest of the world.\n\nSelf-purchasing women are the core clientele for most of the city\u2019s jewellers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got quite a number of bankers, doctors, and we\u2019ve noticed recently more C-suite ladies and entrepreneur clients, [including] some from the cryptocurrency world,\u201d says State Property\u2019s Imram. The majority are Singaporean, but customers fly in from Indonesia and the Philippines, he adds. Local clients are quite brand-driven, so they start their collections with Cartier, Tiffany & Co and Bulgari, Imram says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve seen a growing acceptance of local, independent labels, like State Property,\u201d he notes.\n\nAs a brand that now has around a dozen retailers in North America alone, State Property has learnt to tailor its approach to diverse tastes. \u201cThe different lifestyles, spending habits, weather, even\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the different sizes of people, this makes us pay closer attention to the nuances of each of our clients across markets,\u201d Imram says. It allows the brand to break out of a narrow creative perspective and \u201chelps us design better\u201d, he adds.\n\nState Property\u2019s modern art deco aesthetic is inspired by the blueprints of historic gardens. It combines gold, emeralds, diamonds and black enamel for bangles, earrings, pendants, a three-finger-spanning ring, and \u2014 always \u2014 signet rings (a favourite with clients). The majority of its American clients have slightly different tastes to those in Singapore, however. \u201cOne thing we hear from everyone is how the quality of our products is top-notch, which is something I have to thank our discerning Singaporean clientele for,\u201d says Imram.\n\nThe relatively small society of an island state has given rise to a tradition for bespoke design, from restyling jade and family heirlooms to making something exclusive and unique. In Chinatown there is Madly (which has satellite boutiques in Munich and Dubai) where clients choose from colourful gemstones and commission bespoke designs, mostly rings.\n\nIn the gentrified Tiong Bahru enclave is Calla Lily. Founded five years ago by Emily Tan, who previously worked with Jimmy Choo and Marni before graduating from the Gemological Institute of America, it creates vibrant, contemporary bespoke jewels. \u201cBespoke has always been a natural inclination for me as it allows me to explore different looks and styles,\u201d Tan says of designs that are inspired by the personalities and dreams of her clients.\n\n\u201cThe local market highly values one-of-a-kind pieces, giving us a competitive edge, and the rarity of certain gemstones also makes large-scale production difficult.\u201d\n\nBudgets vary wildly, she says, \u201cfrom S$2,000 to S$5,000 [$1,500-$3,000], but they can go up to S$100,000 and more, depending on the gemstones we source\u201d. Singaporean women feel very safe moving around the city wearing thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of jewellery, Tan notes, so they can enjoy their jewellery without having to wait for a special occasion \u2014 which \u201coften leads them to return for more unique designs\u201d.\n\nWhile Singapore attracts big luxury brands, it has also been a draw for independent jewellery designers. Two years ago, Nadine Ghosn relocated to Singapore, having lived between Paris and London. \u201cI wanted the experience of living in a new place that has great positive energy and [2022] was the time to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cI love Asia, the speed, the safety and the family vibes of Singapore.\u201d\n\nShe has found a ready market for her quirky jewels inspired by everyday items such as Lego, crayons and bicycle chains. \u201cI\u2019ve found locals and new Indonesian and Thai clients open to something different, colourful, fun and customised to their preferences,\u201d Ghosn says, citing her gold Pencil and Crayon bangles and rings, and the stackable Veggie Burger rings, as bestsellers. \u201cI think they appreciate the tongue-in-cheek and unexpectedness of my designs.\u201d Clients start with one piece and return for more. \u201cIt has definitely been my most rewarding move so far,\u201d she says.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/42a6bf1b-0326-44d3-aec0-ae3926a225b9"}, {"title": "Former Singapore transport minister sentenced to year in jail over gifts", "description": "S Iswaran becomes city-state\u2019s first cabinet official to be imprisoned in nearly 50 years", "author": "A.

The remaining 30 charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing, prosecutors said.\n\nIswaran, 62, is accused of obtaining gifts with a total value of S$403,297.92 (US$312,494.20) from two local businessmen during his tenure as minister.\n\nProsecutors have sought a jail term of six to seven months. Iswaran\u2019s lawyers are asking for no more than eight weeks, according to Singaporean media Channel News Asia and the Straits Times.\n\nSentencing has been set for October 3, according to local media.\n\nThe corruption case against Iswaran is the first involving a Singaporean minister since 1986. Singapore prides itself on being one of the world\u2019s least corrupt countries, and its ministers are among the highest paid \u2014 earning about S$1mn a year \u2014 in part to discourage corruption.\n\nThe case comes at a sensitive time for the ruling People\u2019s Action party, which has ruled Singapore since independence in 1965.\n\nLawrence Wong was sworn in as Singapore\u2019s fourth prime minister in May, becoming only the city-state\u2019s second leader from outside the founding Lee family.\n\nThe Asian financial hub is set to hold elections in 2025, and while the PAP is expected to win again, its reputation has taken a hit from a recent series of scandals, including the corruption allegations against Iswaran.\n\nIswaran resigned this year after he was charged by authorities. He has said he will return his salary and allowances received since the beginning of the investigation in July last year.\n\nAccording to a January charge sheet seen by the Financial Times, the kickbacks allegedly included tickets to English Premier League football matches, Formula One races and plays including Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Hamilton and Kinky Boots, as well as a business-class flight from Doha to Singapore in 2022.\n\nSingapore\u2019s Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers said in a statement that the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau had seized items in its investigation including wine, whisky, golf clubs and a Brompton T Line bicycle. It added that Iswaran had forfeited S$380,305.95 to the government to account for the value of gifts including event tickets and alcohol.\n\nThe CPIB has said Iswaran received some of the alleged bribes from Ong Beng Seng, one of the city-state\u2019s most high-profile property tycoons, for \u201cadvancing (his) business interests\u201d.\n\nOng has not been charged. He is the founder of Hotel Properties, which has brands such as the Four Seasons and InterContinental in its property portfolio.\n\nThe company has previously said Ong is providing details of his dealings with Iswaran to the watchdog.", "tag": "singapore?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e829ffc7-9475-4e4c-ba8f-04da0fd015c4"}, {"title": "Active ETF launches stagnate in Singapore", "description": "There has been just one debut since the city-state\u2019s regulator approved the products in December ", "author": "Ernest Chan", "published_date": "2024-09-20T04:00:33.145Z", "content": "Nine months after Singapore regulators approved the listing of active exchange traded funds, the city-state has seen just one product launch, with managers waiting for clearer signs of investor interest.\n\nThe more conservative investing habits of local investors, as well as unresolved gaps in Singapore\u2019s ETF ecosystem and infrastructure, have also damped enthusiasm for the funds, according to industry participants.\n\nFrank Koudelka, Boston-based global ETF product specialist at State Street, said that trying to sell active ETFs in Singapore was likely to be a \u201cgrind\u201d at this stage. But as in many other markets new to active ETFs, asset managers were still \u201ctesting the waters\u201d to see if the products would gain traction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just in its infancy now, and firms are trying to figure out what\u2019s my entry point, how much do I have to invest to get in there, who am I selling to, and are we seeing success with the existing products that are out there,\u201d Koudelka said.\n\nThe Singapore Exchange gave the go-ahead for the listing of active ETFs last December, bringing the city-state into line with other jurisdictions in the region such as Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Indonesia and Japan.\n\nSingapore fund house Lion Global Investors subsequently launched the first such product in January in partnership with Japanese manager Nomura Asset Management, raising initial assets of S$37mn ($28.3mn). The Lion Global ETF has seen its assets inch up to S$49.2mn.\n\nSince then, however, there have been no further active ETF launches in the city-state, and no other products in the pipeline, the Monetary Authority of Singapore website shows.\n\nRival Asian funds hub Hong Kong has 28 active ETFs, with the first such product listing in June 2019, according to the Hong Kong stock exchange\u2019s website.\n\nChen Wang, Hong Kong-based deputy chief operating officer at CSOP Asset Management, said asset managers in Singapore were still studying regulatory requirements as well as gauging market appetite.\n\nCSOP AM has a presence across the Singapore and Hong Kong ETF markets, with five ETFs listed in the former and 40 ETFs in the latter. This includes three actively managed money market products in Hong Kong.\n\nOne critical challenge with investors in Singapore is their lack of familiarity with active ETFs.\n\n\u201cLocal investors in Singapore, they still need a lot more time to understand what\u2019s going on because the Singapore market is a relatively smaller market compared to the US or China or even Hong Kong, and investors tend to be relatively conservative in terms of their investment appetite,\u201d Wang said.\n\nThere was still \u201ca lot\u201d of investor education that was needed to show them the difference between active and passive, and then also the benefits of buying an active ETF versus investing in a mutual fund, she added.\n\nWang did not say whether CSOP AM had any active ETFs in the pipeline for Singapore.\n\nIf there was a \u201cclear interest in a certain type of ETF\u201d from investors, CSOP AM could \u201cmove very fast to launch\u201d, she noted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at new opportunities in the Singapore market all the time,\u201d she added.\n\nEvonne Gan, Singapore-based engagement manager for asset management advisory at Broadridge, pointed out that investors in the city-state could access offshore active ETFs via private banking or online securities channels, so just looking at locally listed products did not give the full picture on investor appetite.\n\nLocally listed ETFs in Singapore recorded the highest outflows among all Asia Pacific markets between January and May this year, with cumulative outflows of $278.5mn.\n\nBut Gan was still optimistic that domestic interest in active ETFs would grow.\n\nThe Singapore bourse was \u201cactively engaging\u201d with issuers who had \u201cstrong capabilities in originating mutual funds to utilise ETFs as another conduit to reach a wider audience through a listed vehicle\u201d, an SGX Group spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cActive ETFs are a relatively new concept in Singapore, reflecting the evolving nature of the investment landscape here,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

Fifteen years as a proprietary trader at Singapore-based United Overseas Bank seemed more than enough. \u201cThere\u2019s a shelf life to trading,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing much to show for your effort except the plus and minus of an accounts book.\u201d\n\nHe looked around for inspiration. He had enjoyed spending time with an architect while commissioning a property in his native Singapore, and kept thinking of the Canadian prairies, where he had spent time as an undergraduate in Saskatchewan. A combination of nature and design felt alluring. So he changed tack and qualified as a landscape architect, taking courses at night while working at the bank. \u201cOne day I was head of the prop desk for bonds trading, and literally the next day I was an intern at the National Parks Board.\u201d\n\nThe transition was tough, but his commitment paid off. Last year Ng was named Singapore\u2019s President\u2019s Design Award \u201cdesigner of the year\u201d \u2014 having previously won four \u201cdesign of the year\u201d titles. Collectively they recognise 16 years of involvement in making Singapore become a garden city, one of the greenest in the world.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise then, that we meet in the garden of Ng\u2019s home, a light-filled two-storey house designed by local architects RT+Q, in Singapore\u2019s Leedon Estate, a hilly pocket of luxury gated houses.\n\nThere is a deliberate lack of order to his garden: \u201cI wanted to feel like you\u2019re in a natural forest,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are no straight lines here. The leaf litter is left on the ground and the trees are unevenly spread.\u201d The garden is multi-layered, just like a rainforest: Borneo Kauri, Malayan Crape Myrtle and Umbrella trees create a canopy, epiphytes grow from the boughs at mid-level and Chinese Fan Palms dot the ground.\n\nPartly, this is a practical matter: \u201cI wanted it to be a self-sustaining low-maintenance landscape. Being a landscape architect, I\u2019m kind of picky, but I don\u2019t really have a lot of time.\u201d\n\nNg points out that the garden is grass-free \u2014 remarkably, this award-winning landscape specialist doesn\u2019t own a lawnmower \u2014 and instead Ng has harvested and cultivated a tough and drought-tolerant local weed, and repurposed it into a resemblance of a lawn, flowing like a waterfall over a step.\n\nThe house itself is custom-designed to combine two dwellings, one for himself and his wife and children (15, 17 and 19), and one for his in-laws, separated by a central lift. Everything is open, with nature invited in: the big open-plan kitchen flows directly to the front garden in one direction and a pool area in the other. Hornbills are frequent visitors; so too are squirrels, who have a habit of stealing their fruit. The garden seems like an extra room, intrinsic to the home.\n\nA heavy wooden dining table is as curved as the garden, shaped to keep the natural characteristics of the tree it came from. A corridor is repurposed as a sort of unhidden shed; tools and a chainsaw hanging in neat order on the wall.\n\nNg has a passion for collecting antique searchlights sourced from old warships, admiring \u201cthe combination of industrial aesthetics, function of communication and illumination\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and the history\u201d. They stand in corners of rooms, adding to the industrial feel. His in-laws\u2019 collection of life-sized bronze figures from the Qin and Han dynasties, by Chinese artist Cai Zhisong, also populate the house, reclining by a spiral staircase, standing like sentries near the entrance.\n\nUpstairs, in his home office, past a large master bedroom with a wooden ceiling fan more often seen in Singapore\u2019s older, colonial-era homes, another passion is indulged: minerals and crystals, an interest Ng shares with one of his daughters. The crystals bloom from small boxes on shelves. Smaller plants thrive here under the attention of photographic lights of sufficient sophistication to impress the FT\u2019s photographer. Ng works beneath a road sign saying Frankel Walk, a memory of his previous home on Singapore\u2019s east coast; his family bought it in an auction when the signs were renewed.\n\nAs we wander through the house, Ng\u2019s attention constantly turns to the plants within and around it. On the roof of the home gym, by the swimming pool, Ng points out hanging plants meshed into fabric on the roof; they reduce heat and the need for air conditioning. By the pool are Australian weeping tea trees, and in a separate Japanese-style garden area in his in-laws\u2019 wing of the home, koi carp drift in a pond angled (by Ng) to create a sense of lengthened perspective. There are Swamp Sheoaks (casuarina glaucas \u2014 playfully known as Cousin Itt for their resemblance to the Addams Family character) draped on the ground like a carpet. Herbs grow in pots. Ng can name every plant in its Latin form; if we go that way, I tell him, the story is going to require quite the fact check.\n\nA series of pools leads visitors to the entrance and garden. This feels right, because from the very outset, water has characterised Ng\u2019s approach to landscape design.\n\nSingapore has a close relationship with water, and not just because it is an island nation. As one of his first acts as leader, founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew elevated water to a national security issue; he recalled only too well the British surrender of Singapore in February 1942, forced, more than anything else, by the fact that the Japanese army had taken the reservoirs. \u201cIn most countries, water is a need, not national security,\u201d Ng says. \u201cBut for us, it\u2019s existential.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we have a large hinterland where we can collect water and supply ourselves. If there\u2019s not enough water on the island, we are beholden to someone else.\u201d\n\nSingapore has the best drainage in south-east Asia, to avoid floods when the tropical rains fall, and sophisticated mechanisms to ensure water supply. But to Ng, there is a greater possibility in water. Collecting water is only part of the challenge, he says. \u201cNext we need to make sure [that] water becomes cleaner. And you do that by trying to change people\u2019s mindset and their relationship with water.\u201d\n\nNg first trialled this while working on the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park project, his first assignment for the German landscaping firm Atelier Dreiseitl \u2014 later known as Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl \u2014 after joining in 2008 (the firm was rebranded Henning Larsen in 2023, where Ng is country market director). This was a pilot initiative to combine rainfall collection, recycling, and the animation of public spaces. \u201cAnd then hopefully the public will engage with these spaces, build a sense of ownership, and be less inclined to pollute the water source,\u201d Ng says. That means cleaner water, less energy for recycling, \u201cand it all comes together. It\u2019s really not about designing the river so much as it is redesigning our relationship with water.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly fitting in Singapore, he says, \u201cwhere every square metre of land is really valuable to us. We cannot afford to have mono-functional uses.\u201d A canal, say, cannot be just for drainage, but also supply and recreation. \u201cSo instead of having one function, now there\u2019s three functions. That\u2019s why we design in layers.\u201d\n\nBishan was, and remains, enormously important to Ng. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out in Bishan park and see people playing and laughing and having a good time, chasing the butterflies and really appreciating it, that really validates the effort.\u201d\n\nThis thinking is visible in many of his later projects: the water play areas at Jurong Lake Garden; the multipurpose model of the Kampung Admiralty building, where the community is bonded through a multi-tiered roof garden filled with local plants. It will be central to his next major assignment, creating mixed-use shared spaces above a 21.5km tunnel network called the North-South Corridor.\n\nAll of these principles are clear in Ng\u2019s home: the interplay of physical structures and nature, the idea that a house and the gardens around it are one and the same. There is a symbiosis here: his work as a landscape architect informs the place he lives, and his home in turn informs his work.\n\n\u201cThis is my sanctuary,\u201d Ng says. \u201cAfter a day of stress you come back and you feel energised. You go out to the greenery and you get inspired to come up with new ideas.\u201d\n\nAnd those ideas are informed by the plants around him. \u201cNature is inherently beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cNature doesn\u2019t require design, and the best we can do is learn from it. But even if we can only produce a poor facsimile of nature, how do we do that in an authentic and faithful manner? That\u2019s what I strive to do as a designer.\u201d\n\nChris Wright is a contributing reporter for the FT, Singapore\n\nSingapore Design Week runs from September 26 to October 6\n\nThis article has been amended.

And even if you have burnt through your three meals a day, a final round of food and drinks with friends is always popular, especially given the plethora of eateries that remain open well into the evening.\n\nTypically, supper fare here is likely to be fried, toasted or grilled over a hot stove. Dishes range from a plate of crispy roti prata \u2014 an Indian-style pancake served with a side of fish curry, which is offered by many late-night food stalls \u2014 or a serving of Chinese-style noodles flash-fried in a wok and dripping with gravy.\n\nI lean on the side of living dangerously and prefer to risk putting on a few extra pounds if it means I can dig into a plate of prata, topped with generous amounts of sugar and soaked in curry. So if you are in Singapore, here are some places where you can get your fix if hunger pangs suddenly strike at odd hours. Beyond the food itself, some of them are also interesting spots in which to greet the early hours.\n\nAbove this supper spot, there used to be a neon sign for \u201cRolex Mee Master Tan Kue Kim\u201d. Mee is a term that locals use to refer to noodles, and Master Tan, the late patron of Kim\u2019s Famous Fried Hokkien\u00a0Prawn Mee, was often seen at night frying up wok-fried delights for his customers. Tan, who died this year, was known for dishing plate after plate of fried noodles in the Chinese Hokkien style. His capable assistants have since taken over the kitchen.\n\nWhile one may question the wisdom of donning a luxury timepiece worth thousands of dollars in a greasy kitchen, but the charismatic Tan made it his calling card, as you can see in the articles about the restaurant plastered proudly across the walls.\n\nThe noodles are a calorie-laden adventure, coated in a savoury prawn-infused seafood stock, with shredded egg, squid, shrimp, deep-fried cubes of pork lard and\u00a0sambal (chilli paste), accompanied by sliced lime on the side. The way to do it is to mix the noodles with the paste and squeeze out all the juice from the lime. For foodies looking for a late-night meal with some heat, this is a fine spot. Those not in the mood for noodles will find plenty of alternatives, from fried mussels to steamed fish head and crabs cooked a variety of ways.\n\nOrchard Road, the city-state\u2019s main shopping street, is usually on the list of places to visit in Singapore. Caf\u00e9 de Muse, situated on two floors of the Shaw House mall,\u00a0is a useful pit-stop for those on a night-time buying spree. Shops typically close around 9pm, but this place remains open round the clock.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 offers Korean-inspired Asian fusion food, with dishes such as bulgogi pasta \u2014 spaghetti cooked with slices of beef in a tangy-sweet sauce \u2014 and kimchi fried rice. Western fare is also available, from duck confit to chicken roulade, as well as lighter dishes such as Caesar salad and a range of teas and coffees.\n\nThis caf\u00e9 occupies a strategic location at the intersection of busy streets in Singapore\u2019s Muslim quarter. It has some alfresco seating, which makes for a pleasant supper on a clear balmy night.\n\nKampong Glam Caf\u00e9 specialises in Singaporean Malay comfort food such as nasi goreng pattaya daging, or fried rice with beef, hidden under a thin egg omelette drizzled with sweet chilli sauce, and nasi lemak \u2014 coconut-flavoured rice paired with fried chicken, egg, cucumber, deep-fried crispy fingernail-length anchovies and a glob of sambal.\n\nTry a cup of hot or iced teh cino, which is an extremely sweet tea and milk drink loosely based on cappuccino. For something more refreshing, go for teh o limau, sugary black tea infused with chunks of lime.\n\nIf you pick the right seat, you can have a fabulous view of the golden dome of the Sultan Mosque, the centrepiece of the Muslim quarter. This is a popular tourist spot, so it is maybe not the place for a relaxed meal.\n\nThose with a passion for motoring will probably find this supper spot right up their street. The Fujiwara Tofu Concept Shop is modelled after the Japanese street-racing manga series Initial D, which has an avid following and was made into an Asian action flick in 2005.\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade looks as if it has come straight out of the comic, bearing the same name as the tofu store operated by Bunta Fujiwara, the father of Takumi Fujiwara, who is the main protagonist of the series.\n\nNo visit is complete without ordering a side of the titular Fujiwara tofu, deep-fried and topped with mildly spicy chilli. The store mainly serves finger food, from Japanese scallop sashimi to skewers of barbecue-glazed yakitori chicken thigh \u2014 ideally paired with a pint of Sapporo beer, or rounds of soju and sake.\n\nFans of Japanese-style izakaya dining are likely to feel at home here. But the real attraction is the cars that pull up to this eatery on a regular basis \u2014 the type of exotic motors often seen in posters on young petrolheads\u2019 bedroom walls. Their drivers like to live out their Initial D fantasies by using the caf\u00e9 as a backdrop for photos, although ironically parking spaces are limited.\n\nSimpang Bedok is a legendary location for late-night food in eastern Singapore. It is not one restaurant, but a collection of places concentrated in one area offering a range of different cuisines.\n\nHere you will find the Bedok Market Place, sited above a supermarket, where a variety of stalls serve up quick eats showcasing Singapore\u2019s street- food culture. These are fine for dinner, but the market largely closes after 9pm. Surrounding the supermarket is a cluster of eateries where locals head for real supper food. These close later, after midnight, while some are open around the clock. One of the latter is the Indian-Muslim New Mahamoodiya Restaurant, located across the street from the Bedok Market complex. It has a seemingly endless menu of roti prata \u2014 Indian-style pancakes, prepared in a variety of ways. Roti prata paired with curry is a favourite supper dish with locals, and you can choose between sweet or savoury, stuffed with anything from egg to cheese to mushroom, or just on their own with the curry.\n\nRoti prata is a crispier version of naan flatbread, and New Mahamoodiya\u2019s creations are known to pack a crunch. One of the crunchiest is \u201ctissue prata\u201d, thin fried dough twisted into a shape resembling a wizard\u2019s hat, and coated in sauces from caramel to honey and condensed milk.\n\nWash it all down with \u201cMilo dino\u201d, a cloyingly sweet chocolate-based drink topped with cocoa powder and sprinkles. Food at Simpang Bedok is greasy, sugary, spicy heaven.\n\nWhere do you go for late-night food in Singapore? Tell us in the comments below.

My parents were both very interested in tennis, which was quite a big and relatively accessible sport in Singapore. I started playing when I was about six years old and, quite quickly, I noticed that, \u201cOK, this is something that I\u2019m actually quite good at.\u201d Tennis became a full-time job on the side of school \u2014 I travelled all around Asia, playing in tournaments.\n\nIt is quite a hectic and stressful lifestyle. Most days would be packed with morning training, then I\u2019d go to school and then, in the evening, training again. On weekends, I\u2019d play tournaments. It was a lot of work. You sacrifice a lot; you don\u2019t grow up as a normal kid. It\u2019s not possible to go to late-night events or hang out with friends, because there is training the next morning, or travel for a tournament. But you also get a lot of opportunities.\n\nAfter I graduated from high school, I got a full athletic scholarship to play division one college tennis, for the University of Wisconsin in Madison. I studied economics and my days continued being similar, filled with training, but, on the weekends, I would travel to different universities. It was fun \u2014 tennis was what I loved.\n\nWhen the time came to look for a masters, I started thinking about leaving the US. I had been able to study there because of my scholarship, which paid not only my tuition but accommodation. Without it\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009university studies in the US are just so expensive. At the same time, I had started thinking about going back to my roots. I wanted to feel the Finnish side of me, as I had never really lived there.\n\nI knew I wanted an international university, where I could study in English. Then I saw that the masters in business and management at Hanken School of Economics offered a specialisation in marketing, which was a perfect fit for how I pictured my future.\n\nThe programme was two years long, with a mix of many different courses and a thesis at the end. It was a very international group and a good mix of those who had come straight from the bachelors degree, versus some who had already worked and came back to do their masters. Hanken was smaller than the average US university, which I liked, as it meant students felt part of a community. The classes, being smaller, meant there was plenty of space for group work and interaction with classmates and professors.\n\nThere were also a lot of chances to get involved in activities and clubs, so I co-founded the Hanken tennis club. I was part of the masters committee, which organised events and workshops for masters students, and the sports committee, which planned activities for students. There were a lot of opportunities to feel part of the community.\n\nMany of my favourite classes were marketing-related, but I also took a lot of finance and accounting classes to broaden my knowledge. Most interesting were probably strategic marketing and marketing communications, where we learn how to market across cultures. They helped give me a sense of which kind of marketing I wanted to do.\n\nMany people think marketing is essentially advertising, but there\u2019s so much more behind it. For example: how can you grow an audience for a sport? How can you make the experience better for the fans? That\u2019s essentially what I do now. I work for a company called Two Circles, in Bern, in Switzerland. We grow the value of sports, backed by data. We use data to understand sports fans to, for example, grow audiences, increase engagement or improve ticketing strategies. It combines my passion for sports with what I learnt at Hanken on the marketing side.\n\nThe main things I took with me from Hanken were soft skills from group projects and presentations that the small class sizes enabled us to have. I learnt how to work with people, to listen and learn from others \u2014 how to ask constructive questions and maintain a solution mindset. A lot of those skills came from being active in student unions.\n\nI want to keep working in the sports industry \u2014 I really enjoy it. And, one day, I think, I will want to return to Finland. My time at Hanken gave me time to get to know the country, and now Helsinki feels like home. I made a lot of friends there.

She said that the government would introduce a new income tax bill next week.\n\nThe finance minister added that the new rates would \u201csubstantially reduce the taxes of the middle class and leave more money in their hands, boosting household consumption, savings and investment\u201d, as ruling coalition MPs chanted \u201cModi, Modi\u201d.\n\nAmong measures meant to make doing business easier, Sitharaman said a high-level committee for regulatory reforms that would review India\u2019s rules, certifications, licences, and permissions governing business as well as the creation of an investment friendliness index of states, would be launched this year.\n\n\u201cA light touch regulatory framework based on principles and trust will unleash productivity and employment,\u201d Sitharaman said.\n\nBusiness groups have long urged India to reduce onerous paperwork and compliance burdens and reform the rules governing labour and land markets to stimulate investment and create jobs.\n\n\u201cThe focus of the budget has, basically, come in consumption via taxation cuts to support lower income and middle income segments of society, because that\u2019s where the pain point has been very visible,\u201d said Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services in Mumbai.\n\nIndia has bounced back since the Covid-19 pandemic and remains the world\u2019s fastest-growing big economy, but GDP growth in the second fiscal quarter that ended in September was 5.4 per cent, the slowest in nearly two years.\n\nDespite strong infrastructure spending by the state, private investment has been sluggish and job creation weak. Inflation has been trending near the top of the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s mandated band of 4-6 per cent, limiting its scope to cut lending rates.\n\nVijayaraghavan Swaminathan, head of research at Avendus Spark Institutional Equities in Chennai, said the government\u2019s intent in announcing the tax cuts was \u201cvery clear\u201d and that they would give middle-class households \u201ca breather\u201d.\n\nIn a special trading session on Saturday, India\u2019s benchmark Nifty 50 blue-chip index fell 0.5 per cent, though consumer stocks were buoyed by Sitharaman\u2019s moves to lower income tax pressures.\n\n\u201cThe market is confused as of now,\u201d said Swaminathan. \u201cA lot of numbers remain to be seen, including how the government is going to accommodate this tax collection hit.\u201d\n\nIn India\u2019s annual Economic Survey, published by the government on Friday, the finance ministry painted a stark picture of the challenges faced by the youth and the economy. These included a reliance on China for supply chains serving critical industries such as solar power, advanced batteries and electric vehicles.\n\nThe report, authored by Modi\u2019s chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran, also urged India\u2019s central and state governments to \u201cget out of the way\u201d and deregulate the economy or face a \u201chigh risk of economic growth stagnation, if not economic stagnation\u201d.\n\nThe report forecast real GDP growth of 6.4 per cent for the current fiscal year, down from 8.2 per cent in 2023-4. The government is forecasting growth of 6.3 to 6.8 per cent in the coming 2025-6 fiscal year.", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1d76cc7f-0f84-4dbb-9c17-0ecd29eb6340"}, {"title": "Bimla Bissell, ambassadors\u2019 aide and socialite, 1932-2025", "description": "As a mainstay of Delhi high society, she helped expats navigate a rapidly changing India", "author": "John Reed", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.590Z", "content": "Bimla Bissell, the social secretary to US ambassadors to India and legendary hostess, whose personal history tracked the country\u2019s, has died aged 92. Outside of India, Bissell is best known as the animating force behind Fabindia, the textile and clothing brand founded by her American husband John Bissell.\n\nTributes since her death in January have used words like \u201ccatalyst\u201d, \u201cconnector\u201d, and \u201csaloniste\u201d to capture the place she occupied for decades in Delhi at a time when India\u2019s traditionalist society and protected economy were opening to the wider world.\n\nSome remember how Bissell dressed \u2014 elegant saris, bespoke outfits tailored from cotton kurta cloth, silver bangles \u2014 or the food she served. From the 1960s, the Bissells hosted a Christmas brunch attended by as many as 300-400 people that featured western breakfast meats like bacon and sausage alongside southern Indian vegetarian fare like dosas and idli.\n\n\u201cBim was a quintessential Punjabi who had to feed you,\u201d says Poonam Muttreja, a friend. Around the Bissells\u2019 table at their house \u2014 first in South Delhi\u2019s New Friends Colony, then later in Panchsheel Park \u2014 you would find artists and writers seated alongside politicians, diplomats with leftist nongovernmental activists \u2014 a curated but eclectic crowd engaged in sparky debate about India, sometimes for the benefit of prominent foreign visitors passing through town, from architect Buckminster Fuller and John F Kennedy Jr to Jordan\u2019s Princess Firyal.\n\nAt these dinners, Bissell kept two tables at opposite ends of the room, strategically swapping guests between them when the conversation got too hot \u2014 \u201clike putting control rods into a nuclear reactor\u201d says William Bissell, Bimla\u2019s son and managing director of Fabindia, when recalling his mother\u2019s \u201ctwo-table policy\u201d.\n\nBimla Nanda Bissell \u2014 known to friends as Bim \u2014 was born in Quetta, British India, in 1932 (now Pakistan\u2019s Balochistan province) to a father who was a veterinarian. She studied at Sacred Heart Convent School and Kinnaird College in Lahore before her family relocated to Pune and then Delhi in the months before Partition tore apart the subcontinent, when her father became the newly independent India\u2019s husbandry commissioner.\n\nBissell had a brief and unhappy arranged marriage to a government aide. When it failed, she separated from him and went to the US to pursue a masters in education from the University of Michigan \u2014 an unusually independent move for an Indian woman at the time.\n\nAfter returning to India in 1957, Bissell took over a nursery school her sister had founded in Delhi, transforming it into one of the city\u2019s first Montessori schools.\u00a0She also helped to develop the crafts base at the Central Cottage Industries Corp, a clearing house for traditional handicrafts and handloom textiles. The following year she met John Bissell, who was advising Indian craftspeople on a grant from the Ford Foundation. In a 2011 interview with The Hindu Business Line, she recalls her colleague saying to her, \u201cHe won\u2019t last long, will you please give [him] your room for the time being?\u201d\n\nThe couple wed five years later in the backyard of then-US ambassador Chester Bowles, a friend of John\u2019s parents. By then, Bimla was working as a social secretary for US envoys, having first taken the role for Bowles\u2019 predecessor John Kenneth Galbraith in 1961. (She would work for four, including Daniel Patrick Moynihan.) That same year, her husband founded Fabindia, though Bimla was crucial in forging contacts with artisans.\n\nThe brand found\u00a0a market with its traditional saris, Nehru jackets and kurta pyjamas, bringing traditional styles and homespun fabrics into the present with bright colours and modern marketing.\n\nIn her role at Delhi\u2019s US embassy, Bissell was key in shaping the ambassadors\u2019 understanding of India at a time when the country leaned heavily toward the Soviet Union \u2014 Washington and Delhi had frequently testy ties. She played a similar role at the World Bank as external affairs officer for 21 years from 1975, helping the organisation\u2019s expat staffers to navigate India but also introducing Indians to a multilateral institution they viewed with suspicion. \u201cShe was good at brokering \u2014 not having things escalate by bringing people to the table for dialogue,\u201d her daughter Monsoon Bissell remembers.\n\nJohn Bissell died in 1998, but Bimla remained a mentor to some, connector of many, and informal gatekeeper for prominent visitors to India. At one dinner in the mid-2010s, after the publication of The Blood Telegram, Gary J Bass\u2019 book about the 1971 birth of Bangladesh which presented Richard Nixon\u2019s India policy in a deeply unflattering light, Bissell\u2019s children remember Henry Kissinger being grilled bluntly by other guests, but gamely fielding the questions.\n\nAccording to Monsoon, when someone once approached her mother about writing a memoir, she replied: \u201cThat I can\u2019t do because these stories belong to other people\u201d.\u00a0Her parents, she says, \u201chad a front row seat on a changing world where they were both committed to making it easier for everyone around them\u201d.\u00a0\u201cMy mother showed up, always, no matter the circumstances, and never said no if she could help someone out,\u201d Monsoon says. \u201cThat\u2019s a dying art.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e1ade26f-bd0e-4c28-b6bf-15316319c634"}, {"title": "Gauri Gill\u2019s photographs of the Indian farmers\u2019 protests", "description": "The artist was drawn to the ingenuity and beauty of the year-long Delhi blockades", "author": "Snigdha Poonam", "published_date": "2025-02-01T05:00:16.586Z", "content": "Cauliflower plants stand in orderly rows across a patch of freshly tilled soil. Not yet in bloom, the garden is bordered by colourful tarpaulins, as if to shield the buds from wandering cattle. On one end, a low concrete boundary has been built, a subtle assertion of ownership. A water container rests serenely on a stone platform. Beyond the polyester divider, a bamboo hut peeks into view, its slanting roof also padded with tarpaulin. Perhaps it\u2019s the home of the person who owns the vegetable patch.\n\nLooking at this photograph, one might imagine it was taken deep in India\u2019s hinterlands, where bamboo huts remain a familiar sight and growing vegetables is a way of life. But this hut and the garden were located not in a village but on a major road leading to Delhi.\n\nPhotographer Gauri Gill\u2019s The Village on the Highway is a visual homage to an extraordinary feat of imagination, one that sprung from a year-long stand-off between the Indian state and the people who till the land. Its roots lie in three controversial laws passed in 2020 to reform the agricultural sector, which employs about half of the population, most of them earning woefully little. Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed ownership of the reforms, asserting they granted farmers autonomy. Freed from socialist-era price regulations and local middlemen\u2019s diktats, farmers were now ostensibly free to sell their crops to the highest bidder, whether state-owned companies or global supply chains.\n\nThe intended beneficiaries did not see it that way. Already strained by rising costs, recurrent droughts and mounting debts, many farmers feared they would be thrust into an unequal marketplace, putting their livelihoods at the mercy of powerful corporations.\n\nInitially, groups of farmers staged protests in their regions. Two months later, frustrated by the government\u2019s refusal to listen, some of them marched en masse towards Delhi. That November, hundreds of thousands of farmers, many of them Sikh, set off on foot and in farming vehicles \u2014 tractors, tempos, truck trailers \u2014 from Punjab and Haryana, north India\u2019s agrarian heartlands.\n\nBut the convoy could not enter the capital. At the Singhu border, police and paramilitary personnel stood behind tall metal barricades armed with batons, water cannons and tear gas. The farmers refused to back off. Instead they decided to lay siege to the border, blocking the highway.\n\nSetting up a temporary base required enormous creativity and resourcefulness, efforts that caught Gill\u2019s attention when she visited the Singhu border. \u201cThey began to repurpose the very vehicles that they had arrived on, or the farming equipment that they used daily and knew intimately, into uniquely habitable homes,\u201d she tells me over email. Uncertain how long they would stay, the farmers created spaces where they could sleep, cook and bathe. Where an empty road had stood, there were suddenly bedrooms, storerooms and living rooms. Communal spaces such as libraries, medical camps, small shops and round-the-clock kitchens manifested as if out of thin air.\n\nAs a photographer, Gill was drawn to this \u201chandmade and homegrown architecture of resistance\u201d, as she calls it, which was built on the farmers\u2019 ability to evoke beauty using the barest of objects and materials. \u201cDoors appeared through tarpaulin, walls arose from bamboo and thermocol, and string and tape held together wood,\u201d she recalls.\n\nEach makeshift structure carried a spark of individuality, a touch of quirkiness. Some featured plain jute curtains, others synthetic ones adorned with bold floral patterns. Doors ranged from plain cloth nailed to the backs of trucks to solid bamboo constructions complete with windows, frames and latches.\n\nAs with much of her previous work, Gill\u2019s focus was on highlighting \u201cthe beauty and generosity in places of profound precarity and acute injustice\u201d. The absence of people in these photographs \u2014 a deliberate choice to protect their identities \u2014 does not diminish their centrality. Each domestic object, a pot on a stove or a bucket of bathing water, conveys their presence.\n\nThe farmers stayed for four seasons. In summer, \u00adkhus- (vetiver) infused air coolers were installed. In colder months, thick blankets padded the walls. In the monsoons, mosquito nets shrouded the sleeping areas.\n\nSome of these items arrived with friends and relatives from villages hundreds of miles away, along with fresh food supplies grown in the farms to sustain the langars, or communal kitchens, a cornerstone of the Sikh way of life. The langars fed not only the protesters and their allies but also the police officers posted at the border. Yet, despite their efforts to persevere, hundreds of protesters died, succumbing to harsh weather conditions, age-related complications, dengue fever, accidents and illnesses.\n\nIn November 2021, the government passed a motion to repeal the laws. With their mission accomplished, the farmers dismantled their temporary homes, bid farewell to friends and comrades, and began their journeys home.\n\nThe Indian farmers\u2019 protest of 2020\u201421 is remembered as one of the longest non-violent protests in contemporary history. It is also a rare instance of ordinary citizens triumphing over an unyielding state. Yet it was marked by countless moments when it seemed that the lights were about to go out.\n\n\u201cThe stand-off had gone on so long, it seemed nothing might ever change,\u201d Gill recalls. \u201cFarmers were dying. I felt down, even as a visitor.\u201d Yet their spirits did not waver. \u201cI remember doughty elders saying to me, \u2018One day the tide will turn.\u2019\u201d\n\nGill reflects on the Sikh phrase Chardi Kala, which means choosing optimism even when you can see the difficulties that lie ahead, indeed because of those difficulties. She could feel the farmers drawing strength from it. \u201cI saw that spirit,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe Village on the Highway\u201d is at Vadehra Art Gallery, New Delhi, from February 4 to March 4\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend Magazine on X and FT Weekend on Instagram", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c2dfb9fc-b2cb-4e37-85d4-13bf77658a3f"}, {"title": "A pivotal budget for India", "description": "Also in this newsletter, media companies take OpenAI to court and the tragedy at the Kumbh Mela", "author": "Veena Venugopal", "published_date": "2025-01-31T01:30:43.956Z", "content": "Good morning. Journalists all over the world have worn down the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cI\u201d keys on their computers this week and I am no exception. Media companies owned by India\u2019s richest people \u2014 Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani \u2014 have joined a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI in the Delhi high court. This is the first big case that could determine some critical issues around training rules for generative AI.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s set the scene for tomorrow. Just another Saturday for the world. But Budget Day for India.\n\nI will confess that over the past few years my interest in the Union Budget waned. It was becoming a noisy event with little impact on on-the-ground realities. There would be some bickering about this or that tax for a few days and then we would all go back to our regular lives. But tomorrow when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents her budget proposals in parliament, I\u2019ll be paying close attention. This (financial) year India has been caught in a deadlock of a falling growth rate, high inflation, high interest rates and high unemployment, and Sitharaman\u2019s proposals have the power to determine the course of the economy.\n\nMy guess is that the minister will rely on public spending on infrastructure to boost growth. This will spread public money more widely in the economy and drive up job numbers. Besides, this has been a cornerstone of the Modi government; great roads are also a good talking point during elections. But Sitharaman will have to keep an eye on the fiscal deficit, which the government has targeted at 4.9 per cent of GDP for the year ending March, and so the amount of money she can allocate to infrastructure development will be restricted.\n\nOne perennial budget demand is for a cut in income taxes for the salaried middle-class in India. This year, though, the frustration of this segment \u2014 which pays taxes but does not access some public services like government-run schools or hospitals \u2014 is particularly intense. There is all kinds of speculation about proposed changes, but the most persistent one is that a fourth tax bracket might be introduced. According to local media reports, the government is working on a new income tax act to replace the current law and has been consulting experts for feedback and suggestions. My guess is that it will be unveiled at a later date (perhaps with a complicated Hindi name like the Indian Penal Code, or Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, was in 2024) and the big changes in the tax structure will come then.\n\nThe one thing I feel certain about is that there will be some AI-related announcements. The budget speech has, in recent years, become an exercise in signalling intent by the government. This week there has been a lot of angst about India\u2019s inability to develop an innovative AI product like China\u2019s DeepSeek. The government will use the budget to announce an initiative or two to get on the AI bandwagon. However, these kinds of programmes have had limited success in the past. Schemes like Start up India, Skill India and Digital India, which were announced with much fanfare, have seen their budget outlays shrink every year.\n\nSitharaman\u2019s budget speeches have got shorter over the years. In 2020, she spoke for two hours and 40 minutes, but in 2023 wrapped it up in 87 minutes. (I\u2019m ignoring 2024 because it was an election year and there were two mini-budgets). I only hope she keeps it crisp this year and focuses on the larger, more important points that will help move the needle on the economy and not get bogged down with detailed explanations about minor initiatives. It\u2019s a Saturday, after all.\n\nDo you have any questions about the Budget? Write to us at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply and we\u2019ll answer them next week.\n\nOn the off chance that I haven\u2019t typed AI enough times today, here\u2019s some more. OpenAI is having a terrible week. Globally, it was rattled by the emergence of a scrappier competitor, DeepSeek, and in India, large media companies joined publishers in a lawsuit against the US company. As chronicled by Indian media, the original case was filed by the Indian newswire service, Asian News International (ANI), in November 2024 in the Delhi high court. ANI alleged that OpenAI was training ChatGPT using copyrighted content without authorisation. In early January, the Federation of Indian Publishers joined the case and this week, the Digital News Publishers Association \u2014 whose members include media houses owned by Ambani and Adani \u2014 filed interventions in the case too. OpenAI has questioned the jurisdiction of the court and is contesting the addition of the two new groups since the key issues raised by them are different from those being contested with ANI. (Book publishers, for example, contend that ChatGPT publishes summaries and extracts, but OpenAI\u2019s view is that it picks up the information from publicly available sources and therefore there is no infringement of copyright.)\n\nThe case will be keenly watched as it is grapples with critical questions about copyright in the age of generative artificial intelligence. Most significantly, the court could determine that use of copyrighted data qualifies as \u201cfair use\u201d for AI developers. If OpenAI is able to convince the court of this, it will open up an enormous trove of material to train its software on. (The company is facing similar lawsuits in other countries too.) Detailed hearings are scheduled to begin on February 21. I\u2019ll keep you posted.\n\nTragedy struck at the Kumbh Mela this week when a stampede broke out early on Wednesday morning.\u00a0Here\u2019s what we know, so far.\n\nIt\u2019s a working weekend for me, alas, and I will be spending most of it in front of a screen. If I can manage to find some time, I hope to get started on the gritty sequel of Paatal Lok on Amazon Prime. I know I\u2019m way behind most people on this, but I have been watching Black Warrant on Netflix and it fulfils my weekly quota for gruesome content, thank you very much. As a palate cleanser between episodes, I watched this lovely Thai film, How to Make Millions before Grandma Dies (also on Netflix). I highly recommend it.\n\nIt\u2019s been a very busy work week and my reading, too, is suffering. I have been dipping into Nina Stibbe\u2019s memoir Went to London, Took the Dog for a few minutes before bed every night. It\u2019s hilarious and wholesome.\n\nI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have any strong recommendations for anything else this weekend (or next, actually).

CVC declined to comment.\n\nA stake in Birmingham Phoenix was also on the block, with bidding for stakes in the remaining teams set for the coming days, as the opportunity to buy into English cricket attracts a range of international investors.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board, which is selling the team stakes, has pitched The Hundred auction as a rare chance to buy into a closed league in one of the sport\u2019s biggest markets. It hopes to emulate the success of the Indian Premier League, one of the world\u2019s richest sports properties with multibillion-dollar TV deals. However, The Hundred is still in its infancy and brings in just \u00a340mn a year from broadcast rights.\n\nThe Glazer family, which controls the Manchester United football team, and a consortium that includes Chelsea Football Club co-owner Todd Boehly, are among potential suitors who have shown interest in buying stakes in the franchises. Owners of several teams in the lucrative Indian Premier League are also expected to bid.\n\nVictory for the Ambanis means they have exclusivity and are set to finalise documentation in the coming weeks, according to one of the people. Taking the stake in Oval Invincibles would add to their global cricket interests, which include teams in South Africa, the US and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe Ambanis, majority owners of Reliance Industries, are among India\u2019s richest and most influential families, with their business interests extending from energy to telecommunications.\n\nThe family also has interests in entertainment and sport, including ownership of the Mumbai Indians cricket franchise, five-time winners of the lucrative IPL. At last year\u2019s Paris Olympics, Nita Ambani, who is married to tycoon Mukesh Ambani, campaigned for India to host a future Games.\n\nThe sale of the eight teams that compete in The Hundred is a pivotal moment for the future of the game. The ECB initially aimed to raise \u00a3500mn from the auction process but has recently discussed a figure of \u00a3350mn.\n\nThat money has been earmarked to help professional cricket clubs invest in infrastructure upgrades and new revenue sources, such as building hotels or conference facilities at their stadiums. It will also help some clubs reduce their debts.\n\nThe ECB hopes the arrival of professional investors into The Hundred will boost the competition\u2019s appeal both at home and abroad by bringing in fresh expertise in areas such as marketing and fan engagement.\n\nThe new owners will also enable the ECB to increase some of the spending caps in the contest so that it can compete for top cricket talent against the many other short-form competitions that have sprung up across the world.\n\nBringing in deep-pocketed investors will also help The Hundred to attract top cricketers to play in the competition, at a time when star talent can command seven-figure sums to participate in the IPL.\n\nHowever, the competition itself has proved controversial with long-standing cricket fans, with critics complaining that the format is simply a gimmick designed for children and casual viewers.", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8f942383-0c6b-48ec-ab00-10eaca956897"}, {"title": "India\u2019s Narendra Modi faces tough budget challenge as economy slows", "description": "Finance minister under pressure to revive growth while maintaining fiscal discipline", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2025-01-30T02:00:10.145Z", "content": "India\u2019s government is under pressure to\u2009turn around a slowing economy but with little room to manoeuvre as it prepares to present one of the most consequential budgets since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power more than a decade ago.\n\nFinance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is facing expectations to announce tax cuts, new capital expenditure and reforms to India\u2019s regulatory regime when she unveils the first full budget of Modi\u2019s third term on Saturday.\n\nBut her ability to revive an economy mired in a broad slowdown \u2014 and allay discontent among the ruling Bharatiya Janata party\u2019s middle- and upper-class political base \u2014 may be limited.\n\nIndia\u2019s pace of growth, while still the fastest among large economies, is heading for a post-pandemic low, dragged down by weaker urban consumption, persistent food inflation, stagnant wage and job growth and sluggish private sector investment.\n\nSecond-quarter fiscal year growth, the most recent reported, was 5.4 per cent, the slowest pace in nearly two years, and the central bank downgraded growth forecasts for the 2024-25 fiscal year.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of pressures \u2014 there has been a cyclical slowdown,\u201d said Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist with GlobalData.TSLombard. \u201cWe have to see whether they will stick with that fiscal discipline they have exhibited over the past few years\u201d, or \u201cdo more on welfare spending\u201d.\n\nNew Delhi recently named Sanjay Malhotra, a former revenue secretary, as Reserve Bank of India governor, a move markets saw as both a changing of the guard and a commitment to the government\u2019s recent record of stronger growth and fiscal rectitude.\n\nIndia\u2019s fiscal deficit is below 5 per cent of GDP and falling, and the government resisted the temptation to unleash populist spending measures in last year\u2019s post-election budget plan, which followed a nationwide poll in which the BJP lost its parliamentary majority.\n\n\u201cThis is a finance ministry that values prudence,\u201d said Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, which expects weaker growth in the first half of this year before a gradual recovery. \u201cA big stimulus package looks unlikely.\u201d\n\nHowever, Shah added that boosting spending on infrastructure \u2014 a hallmark of Modi\u2019s tenure \u2014 \u201cwould help to support economic activity in the near term while also lifting the economy\u2019s medium-term supply potential\u201d.\n\nSpending is already rising in some states, including Maharashtra and Karnataka, where the BJP and opposition rivals are vying to outdo one another with politically driven, open-ended welfare spending promises, pushing the country\u2019s consolidated budget deficit close to 8 per cent of GDP. Local elections are also looming this year in Delhi and Bihar, India\u2019s third-largest state.\n\nWorking in India\u2019s favour, economists expect the country\u2019s inward-focused economy to avoid the brunt of Donald Trump\u2019s expected barrage of tariffs on countries such as China. In a call this week, the US president urged his Indian counterpart to buy more American-made weapons, and Trump later said Modi would probably visit the White House in February.\n\nThe finance minister\u2019s budget address will be followed less than a week later by the RBI\u2019s first monetary policy decision under Malhotra, who replaced the more hawkish Shaktikanta Das.\n\nMalhotra has been facing calls to cut rates from powerful Modi allies, including finance minister Sitharaman and commerce minister Piyush Goyal, who favour lower borrowing costs to support growth, despite inflation that remains close to the top of the central bank\u2019s 4-6 per cent target band.\n\nMany economists expect the RBI to begin easing rates from its current 6.5 per cent level, particularly after it announced measures this week amounting to a near $18bn liquidity infusion in the cash-starved banking sector.\n\nBut Kunal Kundu, India economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, cautioned that the economic vulnerabilities were structural, rather than transitory. He said fundamental shifts, including a focus on education and healthcare investment, were needed for India to create more formal jobs for its huge and under-skilled labour force.\n\n\u201cEmployment and wages remain at the heart of the slowdown,\u201d said Kundu. \u201cWhat\u2019s required is not rocket science: basically, you have to have policies that eventually enable more job generation.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/47fb4c5e-718c-403a-908c-bb490d1516ce"}, {"title": "Police say 30 killed in stampede at Indian religious festival ", "description": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi offers condolences to families of \u2018pious souls\u2019 lost in tragedy at Hindu Kumbh Mela gathering ", "author": "Jyotsna Singh", "published_date": "2025-01-29T13:49:55.616Z", "content": "Police have said 30 people died in a crush at a Hindu festival in northern India, where millions have gathered for what is considered to be the world\u2019s largest religious event.\n\nVaibhav Krishna, the deputy inspector general of police for the festival, told a press conference that a further 60 people were injured in the stampede at the Kumbh Mela in Uttar Pradesh state in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\n\nKrishna said \u201cthree or four\u201d barriers leading to the confluence of the Yamuna and Ganges rivers had collapsed and that many of the devotees who were killed had been sleeping before they were trampled on.\n\nEmergency services were deployed to the scene and injured pilgrims were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment.

Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Brics countries, a grouping of major emerging economies that includes India.\n\nIn a social media post late on Monday, Modi called Trump a \u201cdear friend\u201d and said they were \u201ccommitted to a mutually beneficial and trusted partnership\u201d in several areas, including security.\n\nTrump later told reporters that Modi would visit the White House \u201cprobably in February\u201d, which would make the Indian leader among the first foreign dignitaries to visit since the US president\u2019s inauguration.\n\nTrump\u2019s requests came as India, long the world\u2019s largest arms importer, has been seeking to diversify its weapons suppliers beyond Russia. It has leaned on the US, along with other countries such as France, to close a gap in military technology and preparedness with regional rival China.\n\nModi has also pushed India\u2019s military to support domestic arms manufacturers, part of his ambition for the defence and aviation industries to help make the country a global manufacturing power. Modi has set a target of $35bn for domestic defence production by the end of the decade,\u00a0up from nearly $20bn last year.\n\nNew Delhi needs to upgrade its military capabilities if it is to match those of nuclear-armed neighbour China, according to analysts, including in fighter jets, submarines, tanks, helicopters and even assault rifles. While some domestic arms makers have such capabilities, India lacks critical knowhow for technologies such as military jet engines.\n\nTrump and Modi also discussed expanding security co-operation in the Indo-Pacific region and reiterated their commitment to the Quad \u2014 a strategic grouping that also includes Japan and Australia \u2014 according to the White House. India is set to host the group\u2019s leaders this year.\n\nThe call coincided with a visit by India\u2019s foreign secretary Vikram Misri to Beijing on Tuesday, during which the countries agreed\u00a0in principle to resume direct passenger flights for the first time in five years. The routes were initially suspended during the Covid pandemic, and remained so after deadly border clashes in 2020 soured relations.\n\nTrump said he and Modi also discussed immigration, a priority for the new US administration, adding that the Indian prime minister would \u201cdo what\u2019s right\u201d in terms of accepting the return of illegal Indian nationals from the US.\n\nIndians made up the third-largest group of unauthorised immigrants in the US in 2022 after Mexico and El Salvador, according to the Pew Research Center.", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a33cdadb-5e09-4dd1-a9be-f995466338b6"}, {"title": "How Pakistan\u2019s military is taking over its economy", "description": "The country\u2019s armed forces have become intimately involved in everything from canal projects to energy contracts. Investors are increasingly nervous", "author": "Janina Conboye", "published_date": "2025-01-28T05:00:37.637Z", "content": "On a sunny early January afternoon, two thousand fishermen, farmers and activists gathered on the dry river bed outside Kotri Barrage in Pakistan, the final dam before the waters of the Indus flow into the Arabian Sea.\n\n\u201cSend this message to Islamabad, send this message to Pindi: we will not drink your gutter water!\u201d shouted one activist, referring to Rawalpindi, where the army is headquartered. \u201cWe reject the canal!\u201d roared the crowd.\n\nThe protests were against a Rs200bn ($720mn) project to build canals that would divert water upstream to eastern Pakistan. There, an agricultural company led by the military, Green Pakistan, hopes to turn a large swath of desert into fertile farmland that will guarantee a steady supply of grain and attract investment from Gulf states.\n\nThe canal project is being directed by the government, but led by the Special Investment Facilitation Council, an investment body co-led by Asim Munir, Pakistan\u2019s army chief of staff. Other SIFC initiatives, led mostly by serving and retired officers, include plans to renovate hotels at the foot of the snowcapped peaks in Pakistan\u2019s north and schemes to exploit mineral and natural gas riches in the mountainous frontier with Afghanistan.\n\nProponents say the army\u2019s role is crucial in projects like this: as well as cutting through red tape and settling the squabbles that have prevented Pakistan from developing export and tourism sectors, it can draw in much-needed foreign investment and reshape one of Asia\u2019s most troubled economies.\n\nThe army has always had an outsized role in Pakistani politics. No fewer than four military dictators have ruled the country since independence in 1947\u00a0\u2014 most recently Pervez Musharraf, who was ejected from power in 2008. Even when civilian governments have been in power, there is widespread evidence that army chiefs have held considerable sway.\n\nAnalysts and officials say that the military\u2019s influence over the country\u2019s civilian government is at its highest level since Musharraf\u2019s resignation.\n\nBut in recent years especially, the tentacles of the military have extended even further, deep into Pakistan\u2019s economy. A 2021 UN report described military-linked businesses as the \u201clargest conglomerate in Pakistan\u201d. And at the launch of Pakistan\u2019s new five-year economic plan on New Year\u2019s eve, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly thanked chief of staff Munir for helping save the country from the brink of default in June 2023.\n\n\u201cI must tell you, without any fear of any kind of exaggeration, that I\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009never experienced this kind of co-operation which I\u2019ve received from the army chief and the institution,\u201d he told the audience.\n\nCritics warn that the military\u2019s ever-expanding economic footprint raises the risk that it will favour its own interests over others.\u00a0There are also concerns that its involvement in politics and the economy is distracting it from counterterrorism work, increasing societal unrest and deterring foreign investment.\n\nThe military\u2019s presence also offers acute challenges for the political factions that govern this country of 240mn people. The Pakistan People\u2019s party is the third-largest party in Islamabad and the ruling party in Sindh \u2014 a province of 50mn people where there is widespread opposition to the canal project.\n\nThe party can either resist \u201cor sell out, letting other, more violent and nationalist forces step in\u201d, says Naveed Qamar, one of its senior members of the national parliament. \u201cWe could see our support completely collapse in Sindh.\u201d\n\nMunir has leaned into the army\u2019s \u201csaviour complex\u201d, says Madiha Afzal, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. The military has come to believe \u201cthat it alone can fix Pakistan, that it alone can guarantee the political stability needed for economic progress and can ensure that the economic ship is righted,\u201d she adds.\n\nPakistan\u2019s military leaders began ramping up their involvement in economic matters around the time of Imran Khan\u2019s ascent to power in 2018. Amid an economic slowdown and the accelerating growth of its great rival, India, the military played a prominent role in Khan\u2019s rise.\n\nBut the former prime minister fell out with the top brass, and generals grew more sceptical that electoral democracy could deliver growth, enable Pakistan to compete with India or serve the army\u2019s own widespread political and business interests, analysts and former officials say.\n\nThe need for a rethink became more acute as Pakistan\u2019s importance to the outside world waned. \u201cTen years ago, the US was in Afghanistan, so Pakistan\u2019s geopolitical position was secure,\u201d says Stefan Dercon, a professor at Oxford who has advised Sharif on economic reform. \u201cThey could expect to be seen as too big to fail.\u201d\n\nCounting on waivers and bailouts from friendly countries worried that its collapse might put nuclear weapons within the reach of Islamist terror groups, Pakistan put off serious structural reforms. \u201cIt was an overdraft without ever needing to be called in,\u201d says Dercon. \u201cThat\u2019s changed now.\u201d\n\nWhen Munir became chief of the army staff in November 2022, seven months after Khan was ousted and replaced by Sharif, the country was still haemorrhaging dollar reserves, inflation was rocketing and insurgencies were starting to flare up along the Afghanistan border.\n\nSince then, the general has made saving the economy a core part of his public image.\u00a0Last November, he told a group of businessmen in Karachi that \u201call indicators of Pakistan\u2019s economy are positive\u201d, according to a report by the state news agency. \u201cWhere are the people now who spread disappointment and talked about default?\u201d he added.\n\nMunir has secured an extension to his term, potentially allowing him to stay in office for 10 years rather than the usual maximum of six.\n\nPakistan\u2019s elected government now comprises an alliance of parties whose leaders have all fallen foul of the army in the past, but have united to prevent Khan \u2014 whose allies won the most votes in last February\u2019s contested election \u2014 from returning to power.\n\nWith Khan in prison, the government wants to use its time in power to pursue ambitious reforms that ministers say will transform Pakistan\u2019s boom-and-bust economy.\n\nTheir close ties to the army, they say, insulate them from the feuds and public backlashes that have prevented past prime ministers from completing full terms.\n\n\u201cThere is a broad understanding between all pillars of state that any political uncertainty and political instability would be suicidal for Pakistan,\u201d says planning minister Ahsan Iqbal. \u201cThere is very good positive synergy\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009between the establishment [a common euphemism for the military] and the government to take this economic recovery path together,\u201d he tells the Financial Times.\n\nIn addition to Munir sitting atop the SIFC, alongside the prime minister, serving generals also run Pakistan\u2019s national population registry, its anti-corruption watchdog and task forces pursuing tax reform and the renegotiation of energy contracts.\n\nMunir also directed a 2023 operation against currency smuggling, while admirers also cite his ties to the Gulf monarchies that Pakistan depends upon for financing.\n\nOne senior government official acknowledges that \u201cthere has definitely been mission creep\u201d, but blames politicians: \u201cWe failed to take the steps we should have taken before to fix the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The army] acts as a nudge to get us to tax our voter bank, or right-size the government,\u201d the official adds. \u201cThey see themselves as guardrails for the economic reform journey.\u201d\n\nIn the 18 months since Pakistan\u2019s near-default, the country has returned to a semblance of economic stability. In September, it secured a $7bn IMF bailout and inflation fell to 4.1 per cent in December \u2014 having peaked at 38 per cent in June 2023. The central bank has cut interest rates and has enough dollar reserves to cover over two months of imports.\n\nTo shore up its finances and retain IMF support, Pakistan\u2019s government raised taxes on salaried workers, removed popular energy subsidies and promised to introduce taxes on the politically sensitive agriculture and real estate sectors. It has also said it would slash trade tariffs by a third over three years.\n\nBut the country\u2019s economy is still growing more slowly than its population, with a million more people entering the workforce each year than there are formal jobs. \u201cGrowth is still very low,\u201d says Hasnain Malik, head of equity and investment strategy at emerging and frontier market research company Tellimer.\n\n\u201cThe huge devaluation of the currency has left its scars on consumption power without yet triggering an export boom, and external debt refinancing needs are still very high.\u201d\n\nIn mid-January, a group of Pakistani wind energy executives sat down in a conference room in a military base in Rawalpindi.\n\nAccording to two of those present, a team of bureaucrats flanked by half a dozen uniformed army officers demanded that they revise the state-backed contracts they had signed years before \u2014 changes the government says would bring down electricity prices for ordinary people.\n\nOne of the executives says they were informed by a bureaucrat that \u201cif you do not want to work with us, we will let the right people get in touch\u201d \u2014 meaning one of the officers behind him.\n\n\u201cThe message was clear,\u201d says the executive, who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cWe will probably need to shut down our wind farm in Sindh to avoid going into default now.\u201d\n\nThe episode was the one of several negotiations with power producers that Pakistani authorities, with the support of the security services, have undertaken since August.\n\nNadeem Anjum, the then head of Inter-Services Intelligence, Pakistan\u2019s foreign spy agency, also met energy executives towards the end of 2024 to discuss renegotiating power contracts.\n\nA decade ago, Pakistan attracted heavy foreign investment in its power sector by promising dollar-indexed, state-guaranteed returns. But the recent surge in electricity prices has turned such investors into public villains.\n\nSharif has celebrated these renegotiations as proof that his government will take bold steps to bring down power bills. But they have unnerved the business community and foreign investors, according to seven energy sector executives who shared details with the Financial Times.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t lawyer up and go to arbitration \u2014 we have to live and do business in this country,\u201d complains another energy executive who had his contract terminated last year.\n\nA Ministry of Power spokesperson says the ongoing renegotiations \u201cwill be according to law and with mutual agreement as in the past\u201d.\n\nA letter sent by the German embassy to Munir in October, and seen by the FT, questioned the \u201cunusual manner\u201d in which negotiations over Rousch Power, a company in which a unit of German engineering giant Siemens held a significant stake, were being conducted. It went on to warn that the affair was \u201calready damaging the trust of German enterprises and investors\u201d.\n\nSiemens confirmed that Pakistan\u2019s government had asked to renegotiate the power contracts but did not comment on the contents of the letter. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry offered no comment either.\n\nCritics say that these disputes are hindering Islamabad\u2019s efforts to pursue other reforms, such as the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines. One businessman, who also asked for anonymity, says that having his company\u2019s power contract terminated had forced him to pull out of talks about the airline.\n\nTwo other investors say their participation in a second round of bidding for PIA will depend on the government protecting their stakes in the airline. They also say that they plan to reach out to Fauji Foundation, a conglomerate linked to the military, to join their consortium \u201cas an insurance policy\u201d.\n\nWhile a loss of external investment could yet create an incentive for reform, Ahmed Pirzada, a senior lecturer at the University of Bristol, says there is also \u201ca risk that the country\u2019s elites will respond by consolidating their control over resources, effectively grabbing a larger share of a shrinking economic pie to maintain their lifestyles\u201d.\n\nAzeema Cheema, a director at Verso Consulting, adds that the government\u2019s unpopularity incentivises it \u201cto stick to the few friends it has left, instead of governing for the public at large\u201d.\n\nLast year\u2019s budget was peppered with pork-barrel spending and tax breaks, with legislators, bureaucrats and serving and retired military officers among the main beneficiaries.\u00a0\u201cThe whole idea becomes spend, spend, spend on initiatives that\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. serve only to appease their household guards,\u201d adds Cheema.\n\nPakistan\u2019s military has also launched a broad-based crackdown against political opponents. Thousands of members of Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party have been taken to anti-terrorism and military courts, while many senior leaders have gone into hiding.\n\nThe detentions have drawn criticism from abroad, with the EU warning in late December that military trials for civilians were inconsistent with commitments Pakistan had made to gain access to a preferential trade agreement that has been a lifeline to its textile sector.\n\nSince last year, protests like those in Sindh have erupted throughout the country. Demonstrators calling for Khan\u2019s release clashed with police in Islamabad and others in Balochistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir staged sit-ins and strikes over crackdowns on civil rights.\n\nGovernment and military officials say a muscular approach is needed to defeat terrorism and ensure the political stability necessary for investors to feel safe. But they have denied that their actions violate Pakistan\u2019s constitution, and insist the military does not participate in politics.\n\nThe Pakistan Armed Forces and SIFC did not reply to repeated requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, critics warn that public disaffection with the government is only increasing. They point to increasingly brutal insurgencies that last year led to more than 2,000 deaths in the western provinces where Pakistan is keen on tapping into mineral and gas reserves.\n\nIn Balochistan, \u201cit is hard to find a single family that does not have someone missing or killed\u201d, says Mahvish Ahmad, a professor in human rights and politics at the London School of Economics. The province is home to a Chinese-backed port, Gwadar, and Pakistan hopes to develop a giant copper mine there.\n\nSharif\u2019s coalition has also sought to tighten its grip over the internet and social media, claiming that misinformation is undermining public faith in the government and the armed forces.\n\nKalsoom Lakhani, the co-founder of i2i Ventures, a Pakistan-focused venture capital firm, says throttling the internet \u201cacts as a ceiling on the Pakistani start-up space and commerce as a whole\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe arbitrariness of all of it also adds to overall uncertainty,\u201d she adds, scaring investors away from an industry that contributed over $3bn in export earnings last year.\n\nAfzal, of the Brookings Institution, says the military \u201csees political repression as generating political stability, which is needed for economic stability\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut that political stability comes via cementing its own hold on power, with a politically subservient civilian government nominally in charge,\u201d she adds. \u201cPakistan\u2019s democracy looks worse now than at any point since 2008.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Chris Kay in Mumbai and Patricia Nilsson in Frankfurt\n\nData visualisation by Janina Conboye", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f3dae073-c158-43e2-a8c6-628acc46a868"}, {"title": "India's banking sector slump", "description": "Also in this newsletter: China is building the world\u2019s largest dam and Ashish Gupta\u2019s mantra", "author": "Veena Venugopal", "published_date": "2025-01-28T01:30:36.152Z", "content": "Good morning.

These defaults are highest in the unsecured loans category \u2014 credit cards and personal loans.\n\nAmitabh Chaudhry, chief executive of Axis Bank, said it was a \u201ctough environment\u201d and expected both deposit and credit growth to be subdued until 2026. HDFC Bank, the country\u2019s largest private lender by market capitalisation, reported a 17 per cent rise in provisions (money set aside to cover potential bad loans), a sign it is preparing for higher defaults in the future. ICICI Bank, which announced its results on Friday, offered better news overall but it, too, saw its provisions rise.\n\nTogether with the results of consumer goods companies, which are witnessing slowing demand especially in urban areas, these numbers illustrate the real troubles in the economy. Rising inflation has forced the Reserve Bank of India to keep interest rates high, leading to significant slowdowns in consumption and credit growth. The government this month revised down its GDP growth forecast for the year starting in April to 6.4 per cent.\n\nIn a surprise move yesterday, the central bank announced three measures to inject liquidity into the banking system. These included open market purchase auctions of government securities, a variable rate repo auction (where the central bank allows banks to borrow at a variable interest rate, which is determined through an auction), and a foreign exchange swap where the RBI buys US dollars from banks and strikes a deal to sell them at a later date.\n\nThis sets the scene for Saturday, when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to announce her budget proposals in parliament. My hope is that she will produce some more magic to break the deadlock of high interest rates and weaker GDP growth that has lately plagued the economy.\n\nHave questions about the budget?

The 60-gigawatt project is three times the size of China\u2019s Three Gorges, which is currently the world\u2019s largest hydropower facility, and could cost $137bn. The proposed dam is on the Yarlung Tsangpo river, the Tibetan name for the Brahmaputra, and lies close to Arunachal Pradesh. India\u2019s worries are related to security as well the ecological repercussions of this construction. The dam will give China the power to control water supply to Arunachal Pradesh, including the ability to flood parts of the state. It will also probably change the flow of the river and have an impact on the availability of water downstream even during peacetime.\n\nIndia\u2019s concerns also underline the uneasy relationship between the two large neighbours. After four years of tensions along the Line of Actual Control, in October 2024 the two countries reached a deal to de-escalate the military stand-off. Subsequently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met China\u2019s President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Russia for their first bilateral meeting in five years. Both countries have since withdrawn tens of thousands of troops from the region.\n\nBut the dam sets up the prospect of intensifying competition over water resources between the two nations. India has announced plans to build what would be the subcontinent\u2019s largest dam, the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project, in Arunachal Pradesh. (Caught between the two is the smaller Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, which too has built several medium-sized dams on the same river.) That there will be a significant ecological impact from this is a given, even if China is promoting it as an environmentally-friendly sustainable source of electricity. India is right to be concerned about the strategic edge the dam gives China, but it has limited options to counter the threat.\n\nGlobal investors made the best use of booming secondary markets and offloaded a record amount of private equity stakes in 2024\n\nEach week, we invite a top Indian business leader to tell us their mantra for work and life.

Last October, New Delhi and Beijing reached a deal to resolve a military stand-off and agreed to military patrols along their disputed Himalayan border.\n\nIndia fears that the dam, located in seismic Tibet, could spur floods and water scarcity downstream, while giving China the upper hand in any potential stand-off between the nuclear-armed neighbours, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThere are fears of all kinds,\u201d said Shivshankar Menon, India\u2019s former national security adviser and chair of the Ashoka Centre for China Studies. \u201cThe geopolitics don\u2019t help, obviously, because nobody trusts anybody in this.\u201d\n\nTibet has a third of China\u2019s hydroelectric power potential. The Yarlung Tsangpo \u2014 the world\u2019s highest major waterway \u2014 is Tibet\u2019s longest river, and is called Brahmaputra in India before it turns into the Jamuna in Bangladesh.\n\nThe 60-gigawatt dam on the Tibetan plateau\u2019s rim lies near the border with the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, the eastern tip of India over which Beijing claims sovereignty and the two sides fought a war in 1962.\n\n\u201cIndia and Bangladesh are concerned that the dam would change the river\u2019s natural flow, which could disrupt access to water for agriculture, drinking and other essential human needs,\u201d said Neeraj Singh Manhas, an expert on transboundary rivers and water security in south Asia.\n\nBarry Sautman, a political scientist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said China could argue, however, that Tibet was not the main source of water for the Brahmaputra. \u201cSomewhere between 7 per cent and 30 per cent of the water comes from Tibet. The rest comes from rainfall [downstream],\u201d said Sautman.\n\nWhen it formally announced the dam on Christmas Day, Beijing said it would \u201cbring more sense of gain, happiness and security to the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet\u201d.\n\nChinese officials have dismissed concerns about the impact on environmental or downriver water supplies.\u00a0\u201cThe project will not have a negative impact on the ecological environment, geological conditions and the rights and interests related to water resources of downstream countries,\u201d said China\u2019s foreign ministry\u2019s spokesperson Guo Jiakun.\n\nActivists allege that the 193 hydropower projects built in Tibet since 2000 have led to serious environmental and human rights violations. China\u2019s extensive dam-building projects in Tibet have previously attracted fierce opposition, such as around the Kamtok, or Gangtuo, hydroelectric power plant on the eastern Jinsha river.\n\n\u201cWe are anticipating there would be a huge negative impact,\u201d said Malik Fida Khan, executive director of Bangladesh\u2019s Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services, a government research centre.\n\nIndia is also planning to build what would be the subcontinent\u2019s largest dam, the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project, with an output capacity of 11GW in Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nPema Khandu, chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, told Indian news agency PTI that this dam was aimed at \u201cmitigating potential flood risks from water releases\u201d because China was \u201cunpredictable and can do anything\u201d.\n\nIndia\u2019s dam project has also ignited opposition from local populations and concerns in Bangladesh.\n\nAdditional reporting by Nian Liu in Beijing, cartography by Steven Bernard and data visualisation by Bob Haslett", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3d1a4333-57e9-4e04-b144-882ca3e7fab7"}, {"title": "Lessons from ancient India on post-conflict reconstruction ", "description": "Peace engineering is difficult to measure but critical to do", "author": "Guru Madhavan", "published_date": "2025-01-26T05:00:51.454Z", "content": "The writer is a biomedical systems engineer and author of \u2018Wicked Problems: How to Engineer a Better World\u2019\n\nAncient India\u2019s greatest engineering achievement wasn\u2019t a monument but a metamorphosis. When Emperor Ashoka, who ruled most of the Indian subcontinent in the third century BCE, saw the carnage he wrought in the Kalinga war \u2014 over 100,000 dead \u2014 he redirected his empire\u2019s technical prowess from combat to community. Modern conflict zones everywhere, from Sudan to Myanmar, Gaza to Ukraine, await a similar transformation.\n\nAshoka\u2019s infrastructure once forged dominance over an area that spanned Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Siege engines demolished defences, roads propelled armies, fortifications constrained movement and ports dictated trade. After his moral awakening, however, military roads became pilgrimage paths dotted with wells and rest houses; barriers transformed into trading posts. His edicts, carved into mountainsides, proclaimed a radical vision: infrastructure should be a tool for social cohesion rather than control.\n\nThis vision resonates in modern history. The postwar reconstruction Marshall Plan rewove western Europe\u2019s fractured landscape through roads, power grids and industries, fostering social recovery. Japan\u2019s bullet train Shinkansen was more than a railway \u2014 it marked a shift from wartime priorities to economic integration and national connectivity. Post-cold war Germany turned former checkpoints like Berlin\u2019s Potsdamer Platz into social hubs of reunification. Northern Ireland\u2019s Peace Bridge spanned decades of sectarian divide, symbolising reconciliation. In Rwanda and Sri Lanka, community centres and reopened highways like the A-9 mended societies torn apart by genocide and civil war. These examples affirm Ashoka\u2019s insight: infrastructure can unite or divide, depending on its design.\n\nBut centring peace in engineering also confronts stark realities. Billions of dollars flow into military machinery while peace-building efforts scrape by. Businesses prioritise proxies of power \u2014 price and speed \u2014 over reducing conflict risks. Harmony and stability can feel like unaffordable luxuries.\n\nReconstruction is sometimes less about materials available than about power \u2014 who controls, who benefits, and whose version of history prevails. Technical neutrality is a profitable \u2014 and pernicious \u2014 myth. These constraints expose a deeper predicament. Defence contracts offer clean metrics and measurable outcomes but peace resists such quantification. Like public health or preventive maintenance, its benefits can be hard to evaluate. Without ways to review and reward it, even visionary engineers may find it difficult to justify spending money.\n\nThere is also the need to find agreed upon standards \u2014 each tied to clear metrics and mandates. Safety engineering progressed through structural load limits and fire codes, giving tangible form to abstract risks. Environmental engineering advanced through emissions standards and related safeguards, making invisible threats visible. Peace engineering requires similar discipline \u2014 methods to gauge the results of infrastructure choices.\n\nIn Iraq\u2019s 2003 reconstruction, standard technical metrics showed restored infrastructure exceeding prewar electrical capacity. But this masked a more complicated reality. Years of conflict and sanctions had cultivated decentralised networks. Unreliable central grids had taught Baghdad\u2019s residents to rely on local generators \u2014 adaptive solutions that persisted even after centralised systems returned. This divergence between technical success and lived experience underscores a critical insight: successful infrastructure requires an understanding of those who will use it. Designing infrastructure like transportation networks isn\u2019t simply solving technical puzzles \u2014 it determines how communities interact long into the future. This requires evaluation conducted with the same rigour as structural integrity or environmental protection.\n\nIn peacetime, engineering firms already balance complex risks and competing priorities. Analysing infrastructure\u2019s social effects as well isn\u2019t mission creep \u2014 it\u2019s essential wisdom. This is an important lesson to remember as Ukraine works to rebuild its power grids and Gaza reconstructs its water systems.\n\nEngineering shaped Ashoka\u2019s empire twice: first as an instrument of conquest, then as a foundation for peace. Two millennia later, his transformation highlights an elemental truth: peace isn\u2019t an ideal to contemplate but a structure to make and maintain.", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/62fc4b16-85b3-4d3c-b898-7604833aba24"}, {"title": "Indian jewellers build on diaspora to break into western markets", "description": "Cities such as London and New York have become springboards to reach buyers looking for cultural authenticity", "author": "Milena Lazazzera", "published_date": "2025-01-24T04:00:56.519Z", "content": "When Viren Bhagat announced plans to set up shop in London, he joined a growing number of Indian jewellers expanding into western markets, where the vast majority of the country\u2019s diaspora live.\n\nBhagat started to increase his exposure outside India through his participation in Tefaf, the European Fine Art Foundation fair held annually in Maastricht and New York. Most recently, his work gained attention when Nita Ambani (pictured above), the wife of Asia\u2019s richest tycoon Mukesh Ambani, wore a striking set of his jewellery \u2014 comprising a headpiece, necklace, armlet, two cuffs and a ring, all adorned with larger-than-life emeralds \u2014 at the highly publicised and lavish wedding of her son, Anant Ambani.\n\nIndia has a long-standing tradition of crafting jewellery and cutting and polishing gemstones \u2014 90 per cent of the world\u2019s rough diamonds are processed in the country.\n\nIdiosyncratic cultural practices also set the country apart. For instance, engagement and wedding ceremonies involve exchanging gold jewellery, including a \u201cmangalsutra\u201d necklace for the bride and a bracelet for the groom; although the giving of an engagement ring ahead of a ceremony is rare. On festive occasions, jewellery sets are worn, and deemed incomplete without headpieces, armlets and anklets.\n\nWhile such traditions have historically hindered the expansion of western jewellers in India, they have contributed to the growth of local talents and supported their expansion abroad \u2014 as Indians living outside the country seek to uphold their customs.\n\n\u201cAt first, the Indian diaspora made up a significant portion of our clientele, as they already knew the brand and trusted its quality,\u201d recalls Sabyasachi Mukherjee, founder of Sabyasachi, one of the first Indian luxury brands to establish a retail presence at department stores Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue in New York, in 2020.\n\nIn 2023, the brand then brought its jewellery to a British audience by showcasing pieces at London\u2019s Lancaster House and participating in the charitable Animal Ball, organised by wildlife charity Elephant Family and indigenous peoples initiative the Tintra Foundation. The event was attended by King Charles and Queen Camilla, who both wore traditional Shola masks designed by Sabyasachi.\n\n\u201cBranching out into the west was a natural progression in our quest to become India\u2019s first global luxury brand,\u201d says Mukherjee. \u201cThe understanding and consumption of jewellery is universal \u2014 it is the most accessible category to introduce India\u2019s traditions of craft, quality and authenticity. The west has always admired the richness of our culture, and I saw a unique opportunity to introduce an Indian voice to the global luxury market.\u201d\n\nThe growing global interest in Bollywood cinema and its stars, such as Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra \u2014 brand ambassadors for Cartier and Bvlgari, respectively \u2014 has drawn the attention of western audiences. Also, global luxury brands, such as Cartier, organise ad hoc events to celebrate the Indian Diwali festival, underscoring the growing influence of Indian creativity abroad.\n\n\u201cOver time, our customer base has diversified,\u201d says Mukherjee. \u201cToday, our western clients include individuals who value cultural authenticity, unique designs, and impeccable craftsmanship. Our jewellery resonates with collectors, art enthusiasts, and fashion lovers who appreciate the story behind each piece. Hollywood celebrities and international stylists have also embraced our work, helping us reach audiences far beyond the diaspora.\u201d\n\nWhile Sabyasachi\u2019s designs remain distinctively Indian, a new wave of Indian creators have purposefully expanded abroad to break free from traditional aesthetics. They are targeting a public receptive to new motifs that, while informed by Indian heritage, are not immediately attributable to that particular culture.\n\nThis has been the case for Ananya Malhotra, founder of Ananya, who, by opening a showroom in London in 2022, has found a suitable audience and accelerated her brand\u2019s growth. Ananya\u2019s use of colourful gemstones and designs that reinterpret Indian traditions, such as the chakra bracelet, with a refreshing contemporary twist has gained favour with an international clientele, even beyond the UK. \u201cLondon is a melting pot for so many cultures; it really offers a unique, wholesome exposure for a brand,\u201d she says.\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Karina Choudhrie, who opened her first office in the UK in 2010 and an atelier seven years ago. Choudhrie has seen her business grow rapidly, attracting clients beyond the millions of Indians forming the diaspora and local British buyers. \u201cWe have had clients from Brazil, [North] America, Europe, and Asia,\u201d she says. \u201cLondon has been the perfect base for us and we have seen the business progress organically, largely by word of mouth.\u201d\n\nOutposts in Dubai and New Delhi have allowed her to navigate the challenges posed by Brexit and the removal of VAT refunds for tourists. \u201cWe manufacture in Valenza, Italy, and Jaipur, India, and have offices in Dubai, London, and New Delhi,\u201d Choudhrie explains. \u201cBefore Brexit, we could get deliveries much faster. However, since Brexit, the process has become significantly slower.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the inability of tourists to claim back the 20 per cent VAT has had a noticeable effect on our business in London. That said, having offices in both Dubai and London has helped us adapt to these challenges.\u201d\n\nValery Demure \u2014 founder of an agency representing jewellers and a regular exhibitor at PAD, the London design and art fair \u2014 says that, despite issues linked to Brexit and VAT, London remains a vital window for international jewellers. Prestigious art fairs, such as Frieze, that attract wealthy clients, and a lively sporting and social calendar \u2014 including events such as Royal Ascot and Wimbledon, attended by royal family members \u2014 all contribute to London\u2019s enduring appeal.\n\nAt last year\u2019s PAD, Demure showcased Studio Renn, by Mumbai-based couple Rahul and Roshni Jhaveri, which created a series of rings made from unconventional materials, including concrete. It made a strong statement that, whether by honouring traditions, updating them or breaking them entirely, Indian jewellers remain committed to changing perceptions, and expanding beyond their national borders.", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c2244bb2-94e9-4c8c-b259-732daeb9ceb8"}, {"title": "India\u2019s restaurants versus Swiggy and Zomato", "description": "Also in this newsletter, Hindustan Unilever readies for Gen Z customers and the 76th Republic Day parade", "author": "Veena Venugopal", "published_date": "2025-01-24T01:30:55.895Z", "content": "Good morning.

Do you have any questions? Send them to us and we\u2019ll answer them the week after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announces her plans for the year.\n\nIn today\u2019s newsletter, we look at Hindustan Unilever\u2019s acquisition of homegrown skincare brand Minimalist, a mouthwatering prospect for other direct-to-customer brands. But first, the big fight. It\u2019s restaurants versus Swiggy and Zomato.\n\nThe delivery person is taking over the kitchen. The already uneasy relationship between restaurants and food delivery apps has now taken a turn for the worse, with the launch of Swiggy\u2019s Snacc and Zomato-owned Blinkit\u2019s Bistro. These standalone apps from the two popular delivery platforms promise to deliver meals, snacks and beverages in under 15 minutes. How is it different from regular Swiggy and Zomato, you ask? The platforms have effectively taken restaurants out of the equation; the food is sourced from so-called \u201cdark\u201d kitchens.\n\nThe association of restaurant owners is up in arms. They are evaluating legal options, as well as adding this to a complaint they have already registered with the competition commission. Their contention is that Swiggy and Zomato have access to all the data and this can be used to predict customer preferences and run a more efficient operation, putting traditional eateries at a disadvantage. The new apps will also be able to dynamically price their samosas and biryani.\n\nTheir angst is understandable. Restaurants are in a tough position \u2014 they can neither live with Swiggy and Zomato nor can they live without them. The food delivery companies\u2019 massive fleets give restaurants access to a much larger base of customers but cut into their margins, charging platform fees and placing tremendous pressure on restaurants to extend offers and discounts. Even if a restaurant invests in its own delivery service, customers are now so comfortable with these platforms that it is difficult to get them to change their behaviour and order directly. What was seen as a blessing for the industry during the pandemic has now become an existential threat.\n\nParadoxically, food delivery platforms, too, are finding it tough going. Zomato, which announced its quarterly results earlier this week, reported a slowdown in the gross order value of its food delivery business. This is the total value of all orders before cancellations, refunds etc. Its stock has fallen nearly 20 per cent since, and shares in rival Swiggy have dropped 9 per cent this week too.\n\nIn a letter to restaurant partners last week, Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal wrote that his goal for Bistro was to find a workable model that the restaurant industry can replicate. I am not sure what comfort restaurants can take in this. There is no denying that Swiggy and Zomato have had significant impact in changing urban lives (not to mention the ubiquitous presence of orange and red riders on our streets), but much of this was fuelled by venture capitalist money racing for customer acquisition. Now that the discounts are drying up, customers are going back to the simpler (and healthier) pleasures of home-cooked meals.\n\nHave you cut down on Swiggy/Zomato orders? (I have). Write to me at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply.\n\nHindustan Unilever\u2019s Rs30bn ($345mn) acquisition of skincare brand Minimalist is a shot in the arm for homegrown brands started mostly by young entrepreneurs who use the power of social media to sell directly to customers. Minimalist was founded five years ago by two brothers, Rahul and Mohit Yadav. The Jaipur-based duo launched a series of serums to help alleviate skincare concerns, but they ran a tight ship and managed to get a valuation of Rs1bn in less than a year. The brothers, who get to take home more than Rs18bn from this deal, will continue to work in the business for the next two years.\n\nInstagram has been a breeding ground of sorts for several homegrown brands in the skincare and beauty segment. Sugar Cosmetics, Lovechild, and Dot & Key are some of the more popular names. The Meta ecosystem helps these brands circumvent the big traditional operating costs involved in running consumer businesses. Their advertisements are Instagram reels, often featuring the founders themselves or their friends and family. Orders are placed through the same platform and customer communication is on WhatsApp. The logistics model for product delivery is also easy to access, cheap and well-established by now.\n\nCompetition is high but brands that manage to keep costs low and run a tight operation have seen valuations gallop. To me, the most significant aspect of this acquisition is that it signals the coming of age of Gen Z, which has now started entering the workforce. It is imperative for Hindustan Unilever, the grand doyen of the consumer business, to understand the ways of this new creature, their customers of the future.\n\nSunday is India\u2019s 76th Republic Day, and this year is special because it marks 75 years of the Indian Constitution. Here is a look at what you can expect in the parade this year.\n\nMy favourite activity when I left home for college was going to the post office and sending my parents telegram messages by picking a random greeting code (Kids, I don\u2019t have the time to explain this to you now).

Across the industry, \u201cthere is genuine concern [that] credit growth will drop to single digits\u201d, said Rahul Arora, chief executive of Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities in Mumbai.\n\nThe RBI, which launched its crackdown on unsecured lending after millions of Indian households loaded up on easily available credit, said in its financial stability report at the end of December that its measures to curb risky lending were \u201cfructifying\u201d. The sector\u2019s annual retail lending growth was down from a compound annual growth rate of 26.9 per cent between September 2021 and September 2023 to 13 per cent in September 2024.\n\n\u201cAn area of concern, however, is the sharp rise in write-offs, especially among private sector banks, which could be partly masking worsening asset quality in this segment and dilution in underwriting standards,\u201d the central bank noted. In late 2023, the RBI raised the minimum amount of capital that must be held for personal loans from 100 per cent to 125 per cent, to decrease risks.\n\nConcerns about slowing credit \u2014 a drag on the economy with the government downgrading expected growth to 6.4 per cent this fiscal year compared to previous estimates of 8.2 per cent \u2014 have also made investors wary about the industry.\n\nSome large Indian lenders\u2019 earnings have been more robust. Kotak Mahindra Bank\u2019s shares jumped more than 9 per cent on Monday after it posted a 10 per cent rise in quarterly profit, even as money set aside for potential bad loans increased 37 per cent.\n\nBut across the sector, S&P Global Market Intelligence said the market capitalisation of India\u2019s top banks fell in the fourth quarter as \u201cinvestor sentiment turned sour amid lacklustre credit growth and shrinking margins\u201d. Of the 20 largest banks, 15 lost value compared to the previous quarter.\n\nThe Nifty Banking Index, which tracks the stock performance of India\u2019s largest lenders, has dropped 5.3 per cent over the past month \u2014 deeper than a 2.3 per cent fall in the country\u2019s blue-chip benchmark Nifty 50 over the same period.\n\nLoan growth had been mainly driven by the non-corporate segment, and business lending had yet to resume, according to Ashish Gupta, chief investment officer at Axis Mutual Fund.\n\n\u201cThere are certainly pockets that were overheated and needed to be clamped down on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the other thing is that we should allow some degree of accidents to happen, there has to be some degree of risk-taking in lending.\u201d\n\nThe pressures on the industry\u2019s loan book come as India\u2019s banking sector also struggles with tight liquidity, with the RBI ramping up dollar sales to defend the country\u2019s currency. Along with tax outflows, this \u201cmagnified the squeeze in recent weeks\u201d, said DBS Bank economist Radhika Rao.\n\nOn January 15, the central bank announced it would start conducting daily variable rate repo auctions after the banking system liquidity deficit rose past Rs2tn ($23bn) last week. Those actions were \u201clikely to at least neutralise the draining impact of regular intervention, in the face of global pressure points\u201d, Rao said.", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9a825e8d-b84d-4efd-8af4-16a927f55792"}, {"title": "The fight over land holding back India\u2019s green energy revolution", "description": "Competing demand for space is leading to bitter disputes between companies and the people who rely on farming to make a living", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2025-01-21T05:00:21.828Z", "content": "For decades, farmers had tilled the land outside the town of Nandgaon in western India, growing crops including corn and millet.\n\nBut in late 2022, Tata Power, one of the country\u2019s largest energy producers, announced it would begin setting up hundreds of glinting photovoltaic panels stretching out across that sun-drenched patch of countryside in the state of Maharashtra.\n\nThe 100-megawatt solar development by the arm of the vast Indian conglomerate, which aims to supply clean electricity to domestic steel producer Viraj Profiles, alarmed the local community. Many see the solar plant as a corporate land grab of a slice of state-owned territory that their families had been granted permission to cultivate over multiple generations.\n\n\u201cWe want the land to be ours again,\u201d declares Malik Jhela Hire, a weather-beaten 75-year-old farmer. \u201cWe want justice.\u201d\n\nAs construction began on the solar park, a group of farmers mounted protests and hunger strikes outside the offices of top local government officials, claiming their rights were being ignored.\n\nTaking note, Maharashtra\u2019s forest department, which claims purview over the land, ordered action against the Tata project. Codenamed \u201cOperation Solar\u201d, a morning raid in late March 2023 saw about 100 law enforcement officers descend on the site and seal it up.\n\nThe situation typifies the complexities India is facing as it embarks on its green energy revolution. In India, the third-biggest carbon polluter globally, billions of dollars are being poured into projects to meet a government target to more than double its non-fossil fuel sources of power to 500 gigawatts by the end of the decade.\n\nBut this breakneck effort is triggering land disputes across the world\u2019s most populous nation, highlighting the difficulty of building out capacity in fast-growing, crowded and power-hungry developing countries.\n\nThe raid on Tata\u2019s solar project is just one example of the stumbling blocks in India\u2019s energy transition. Companies are frequently struggling to find available land and are becoming ensnared in ownership conflicts.\n\n\u201cIt already is a challenge and I suspect that as more and more projects are being developed it will become an even greater challenge,\u201d says Jason Pellmar, regional industry manager for infrastructure in India, Bhutan and Maldives at the World Bank\u2019s International Finance Corporation.\n\nOther obstacles include environmental hold-ups, such as the legal protection granted to the Great Indian Bustard, a gravely endangered and poor-sighted bird that flies into renewable transmission lines in India\u2019s northern deserts.\n\nIndia\u2019s clean energy sector has also come under renewed focus after US prosecutors indicted infrastructure magnate Gautam Adani \u2014 who has raised billions of dollars from American investors \u2014 as well as some executives at the billionaire\u2019s eponymous conglomerate. The charges relate to an alleged $265mn bribery scheme of Indian officials to secure solar deals.\n\nAdani, who denies any wrongdoing, has had projects come up against marginalised communities as have many major power producers. According to Indian research group Land Conflict Watch, at least 31 disputes involving green energy projects have affected nearly 44,000 people \u2014 a figure that founder and director Kumar Sambhav calls a \u201cconservative estimate\u201d.\n\nIn a recent study, the New Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water estimates that currently only 35 per cent of onshore wind and 41 per cent of solar real estate potential in India is located in areas without historical contest over land \u2014 figures that will probably only worsen as the country makes strides towards its net zero aims.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a big problem for the developers,\u201d Sambhav adds. \u201cMany projects get stalled or delayed.\u201d\n\nThose increasing constrictions come at a critical juncture for India\u2019s green energy drive as companies like Tata expand their renewable businesses. When the conglomerate, which has set up and is constructing nearly 17GW of non-fossil fuel power capacity, first revealed it would set up the solar park near Nandgaon, Tata described it as \u201canother step\u201d in its mission to establish clean energy solutions throughout India.\n\nYet for farmers, the project represents an existential threat to practices dating back to the 1970s, when the government allowed them to farm the reserved forest land to boost food production as part of India\u2019s agricultural Green Revolution.\n\nAt the heart of the matter is confusion over who holds the ultimate title of the more than 200 acres, a question that has now reached the High Court of Bombay. To secure the site outside Nandgaon, Tata, like many businesses, turned to a land \u201caggregator\u201d, or middleman, according to people familiar with the matter. One of the people said the land had long been \u201cdelisted\u201d as environmentally protected land.\n\nBut according to forest department officials and documents seen by the Financial Times, technically no notification was seemingly issued regarding its deforestation \u2014 meaning its sale should not have been authorised, despite it no longer being a wooded area.\n\nTata Power declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation. Viraj Profile, India\u2019s renewable energy ministry, Maharashtra\u2019s state forest department and the local government in Nashik district, where the project is based, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not against renewable development,\u201d says Raju Desale, the Maharashtra state secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress and an official with the Communist Party of India, which helped organise the farmer protests.\n\nBut with Indian bureaucrats under top-down pressure to open up real estate for green energy projects, Desale adds that \u201cthey encroached the land\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that land is [the farmers\u2019] livelihood\u201d.\n\nWhen India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to the podium in Glasgow at the 2021 COP26 climate summit, he surprised the crowd by setting the country\u2019s net zero target for 2070.\n\nThe announcement was seen as a major turnaround for the coal-rich country, whose government argues that developing nations, which are not to blame for historic emissions, should rightly tap fossil fuel resources at their disposal to power their industrial growth.\n\nModi\u2019s stated ambition highlighted a shift that was already under way, with India scaling up its renewable capacity spurred by a dramatic fall in the cost of equipment such as solar panels, and a rush of green investment into the country.\n\nBut the sector has hit a familiar problem in India. Competing demands for land in this densely populated nation of 1.4bn people have long been cited by businesses as a critical bottleneck to investment. About 60 per cent of India\u2019s land is farmed, compared with the 37 per cent world average, according to the World Bank, and agriculture is the main means of livelihood for the country\u2019s majority.\n\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis estimates India\u2019s net zero goal may require up to 75,000 square kilometres of land for solar energy alone \u2014 equivalent to the size of the Republic of Ireland or about 2 per cent of India\u2019s total area. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has also calculated that a single megawatt of solar power requires on average four acres of land.\n\n\u201cAvailability of adequate land is a constraint for economic development and infrastructure growth broadly in India, and solar energy is not immune,\u201d says Shayak Sengupta, India programme lead at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.\n\n\u201cI suspect it will get more difficult to acquire land as projects spread geographically, especially as the most attractive parcels get used first.\u201d\n\nThe issue is compounded by the fact that land rights remain one of India\u2019s most sensitive political issues. Attempts by Modi\u2019s government to overhaul land acquisition laws in his more than decade-long rule have met fierce resistance. Massive protests by farmers in northern India forced the government to repeal controversial agricultural reforms in 2021, marking one of Modi\u2019s most significant policy reversals.\n\nIn practice, securing large, continuous tracts of land requires lengthy negotiations with vast numbers of farmers in a country where the average size of agricultural holdings shrank by about a third to 0.74 hectares in the five years through March 2022, according to a recent government survey. Renewable developers often have to design projects in a \u201csuboptimal way just by virtue of where you\u2019re able to procure your land\u201d, says the IFC\u2019s Pellmar.\n\nIndia\u2019s land market is also notoriously opaque, with a widespread absence of easy-to-access ownership records and complicated government acquisition rules. Developers often resort to middlemen to secure holdings, which opens the door to graft and competing claims.\n\nThose hurdles are frustrating corporate India, particularly carbon-heavy industries. \u201cIt\u2019s time-consuming,\u201d says Neha Soni, general manager for business development at ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, which has built its own wind and solar capacity to curb factory emissions. \u201cLand is a scarce commodity, so it\u2019s a constraint.\u201d\n\nModi has pushed India\u2019s states to make more land available for renewable projects and many businesses now look to local governments for access to uncontested or barren land. Some states, including Maharashtra, have also allowed those setting up green energy parks to sidestep social and environmental impact assessment requirements.\n\n\u201cState and central governments have gotten creative in helping developers acquire land through leasing or offering government land,\u201d says Sengupta.\n\nBut even this approach has limitations. In many cases, governments free up state-owned \u201ccommon land\u201d or \u201cwasteland\u201d for renewable energy projects, despite the fact that these areas are often used by local pastoralists and impoverished farmers for grazing or cultivation. These communities, which typically lack formal legal rights, are frequently left without adequate compensation or recourse when the land is repurposed.\n\nSambhav at Land Conflict Watch says these types of battles have a common theme. \u201cGovernments often present land as free of encumbrances, but on the ground, developers face protests from locals who have used it for generations.\u201d\n\nOne potential solution mooted by energy experts is the wider deployment of so-called agrivoltaics \u2014 the dual use of solar panels typically raised above working farm land. Depending on the angle and space of the equipment, crops can be protected, or exposed to light and heat.\n\nThe first such project was tested in 2012 in the western India state of Gujarat. Since then more than a dozen pilots have been attempted. A study funded and published last year by the German Agency for International Cooperation calculated that potential agrivoltaic energy generation in India could reach anywhere between more than 3,000GW and almost 14,000GW.\n\nCharles Worringham, who contributes analysis on India\u2019s energy transition for IEEFA, says the potential of agrivoltaics to reduce land conflicts is \u201cextraordinarily promising\u201d and \u201ccould really benefit\u201d the country\u2019s vast rural economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got enormous potential, but there are fairly substantial financial barriers and policy barriers to get squared away,\u201d he adds.\n\nHolding back significant agrivoltaic generation is regulation and tax strictures across many Indian states that classify land for either agricultural or commercial use, forbidding dual use of farm land for business activity beyond harvesting.\n\nExperts say the commercial viability of multipurpose cropland producing renewable energy has also not yet been tested, and many farmers will be reluctant to gamble on new technology until it is more established.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not been done at scale and in India often farmers learn from farmers, you learn from your neighbour,\u201d says Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water research institution. \u201cThe scale-up and acceleration of renewables in India is not going to come from one business model but an experiment with many.\u201d\n\nOther less land-intensive routes to net zero are being actively pursued by Modi\u2019s government, including the expansion of rooftop solar. In February last year his administration launched a subsidy programme covering up to 40 per cent of the costs of installing panels on residential properties. The aim is to cover 10mn households under the scheme by March 2027, up from 630,000 currently.\n\nOverall generation capacity of rooftop solar has expanded at a swift clip, adding more than 3GW to an almost 15.7GW total since April 2024 \u2014 though falling far short of an earlier target set by the Modi government to hit 100GW by 2022.\n\n\u201cRooftop solar could and should be part of the solution,\u201d says Pellmar from the IFC. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the ultimate answer, given the massive targets that the government of India has.\u201d\n\nFor now, many producers at the forefront of India\u2019s green energy ambitions still require large tracts of land, and some are bogged down in lengthy and heated contests. Shortly after its solar park near Nandgaon was raided and closed up, Tata Power filed a challenge against the action in the High Court of Bombay.\n\nAs the litigation winds its way through India\u2019s sluggish and overburdened legal system, Maharashtra\u2019s advocate general, the state\u2019s most senior legal adviser, asked for the project to be reopened and work recommence in the interim even as the case remains pending, according to the people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by the FT.\n\nWhile the farmers outside Nandgaon are not party to the court dispute, many of them told the FT during a recent visit to the area that they remain angry, claiming that they had been ousted from their land. Following the forest department\u2019s raid, \u201cwe had expectations that everything would be all right\u201d, says 30-year-old Sanjay Tikaram Sonawane. \u201cBut then they started work again.\u201d\n\nSome are now despondent and say there is little support for them after years of petitioning the government to grant them title to a swath of territory that they have in practice been living off for generations. \u201cWe\u2019re on our own,\u201d adds Sonawane, as uniformed security guards from the surrounding and enclosed solar park keep careful watch nearby.Additional reporting by Andrea Rodrigues in Mumbai", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a8528845-dfe9-4121-a115-c475d0302d3e"}, {"title": "Few buyers for India\u2019s new electric cars", "description": "Also in this newsletter: Meta\u2019s troubles with the competition commission, and Gautami Gavankar\u2019s mantra", "author": "Veena Venugopal", "published_date": "2025-01-21T01:30:20.362Z", "content": "Good morning. It\u2019s going to be a busy news week. Donald Trump was just sworn in as the 47th US president, and he\u2019s already signed a raft of executive orders and rescinded dozens of Biden-era directives. FT experts will break down what his second term means at a subscriber-only webinar on Thursday \u2014 don\u2019t miss it.\n\nAlso busy this week is Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, who is hosting a big inauguration dinner for Trump. Meanwhile in India, his company is hoping for a temporary reprieve from proceedings against it by the country\u2019s competition watchdog.\n\nBut first, electric vehicles are all the rage at this year\u2019s auto expo, even if they are hard to spot on our roads.\n\nElectric vehicles are getting a big push at this year\u2019s Bharat Mobility Global Expo (previously, auto expo). The Indian auto industry\u2019s biggest show kicked off with the prime minister on Friday making the case for \u201ceconomy and ecology\u201d, highlighting the government\u2019s focus on the development of green technologies and reducing the import bill for fossil fuels.\n\nIn March 2024, the government unveiled policies aimed at promoting India as a manufacturing destination for EVs. Companies investing $500mn in production facilities in the country are allowed to import electric cars as \u201ccompletely knocked down kits\u201d (where all the parts of the car are imported and assembled locally)\u00a0at a reduced customs duty of 15 per cent (from 70 per cent) for five years. Many Indian states have also announced their own incentive schemes for EV manufacturers.\n\nOver the weekend, several companies unveiled their EV offerings for India. Chinese carmaker BYD launched its electric sport utility vehicle, Sealion 7; Vietnam\u2019s VinFast announced it would be launching two electric SUVs later this year; and homegrown Maruti Suzuki launched an electric version of its Vitara model, among others.\n\nWhile two and three-wheelers have witnessed consumer enthusiasm, the same cannot be said for cars. The government is hoping EVs will constitute 30 per cent of passenger cars in India by 2030, but they only have about 2 per cent market share now.\n\nBattery life and charging infrastructure continue to be a significant problem. It takes nearly a day to charge a car from an AC socket. While companies do install wall box chargers, they are often vulnerable to theft. In urban India\u2019s unpredictable traffic and road conditions, range anxiety is a real issue. Access to charging points on highways is almost non-existent, making EVs a consideration for a second car in the household at best.\n\nThis is a bit of a chicken and egg situation for the industry. Car sales have to cross a certain threshold for manufacturers to invest more in the charging infrastructure but the poor charging infrastructure is a deterrent for higher sales. Indian customers are still following a wait and watch approach. While the government\u2019s EV push for manufacturing will drive investment and employment, it should also augment the charging infrastructure in order to make private investments in manufacturing a feasible option.\n\nDo you own an EV?

In the US, Mark Zuckerberg is busy currying favour with the new administration, hosting a black-tie dinner for Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration after ending fact-checking on Facebook and Meta\u2019s diversity initiative. In India, on Thursday, an appeals tribunal will decide whether Meta gets some reprieve from a $24.5mn fine and stringent conditions that India\u2019s anti-monopoly watchdog has imposed.\n\nIn November, the Competition Commission of India asked WhatsApp to stop sharing user data for advertising with other Meta entities, such as Facebook and Instagram, for a period of five years. This was after the agency\u2019s 2021 review raised concerns that users of the messaging app could not meaningfully opt-out from their model of data sharing across platforms.\u00a0The social media giant has reportedly claimed the order will force it to roll back or pause some of its services in India.\n\nIndia is WhatsApp\u2019s largest market, with nearly 500mn users, and with digital payments and ecommerce it is now more than just a messaging platform. Meta\u2019s advertising business model hinges on accessing users\u2019 phone numbers, transaction data and other behavioural and device information. Internet companies make it seem like personalised advertisement is a good thing for users, when in reality it is a better thing for themselves.

Great news from India\u2019s space agency, which yesterday announced it had managed a successful space docking (joining two fast moving satellites in space). India is the fourth country to manage this feat, after the US, Russia and China.\n\nIndia\u2019s software services sector could also do with some good news. Tech chief executives are keeping their fingers crossed that a Trump presidency will unleash animal spirits in American corporations, triggering higher spending on IT services. We\u2019ll take a look. But first, what are your job and salary prospects?\n\nWhere are the best jobs and what\u2019s your pay packet going to look like this year? According to the annual salary trends report published by Randstad, the best paying junior and mid-level jobs are found in Bengaluru, and senior management roles are the juiciest in Mumbai. (Excuse me for a minute while I cry in Delhi-NCR).\n\nSalaries in Bengaluru are 23 per cent and 9 per cent higher than the national average for junior and mid-levels respectively. For senior positions, Mumbai pay packets are 12 per cent higher than the national average. Surprisingly (at least to me), Bengaluru jobs are not just in the IT sector; the city leads in financial services, manufacturing, automotive, retail and consumer goods too. Mumbai (predictably) excels in finance and banking sector jobs.\n\nInternet and ecommerce \u2014 undoubtedly the growth industries currently \u2014 are the best paymasters, but salaries in the advertising, market research and public relations industries have taken a big leap too (26 per cent).\n\nBut to me, the real story is the collapse of Delhi-NCR. The report places it at rank seven (in tier 1 cities) for mid-level and senior executive pay. In both of these categories, salaries here are lower than the national average. Delhi-NCR is fifth at the junior level and the pay is a hair over the average, and it is consistently ranked seven (out of eight) in all the sectors the report analysed.\n\nTwo decades ago, when the shiny glass and chrome buildings emerged in Delhi-NCR\u2019s Gurgaon, it quickly became the hub of corporate India with large Indian conglomerates and big multinationals setting up headquarters. It was great for a while, but terrible air pollution and civic services increasingly lagging behind have really done a number on the quality of life in the national capital. The other issue is that the region is spread over three states, with different rules and standards, and there is no central authority responsible for its growth and upkeep.\n\nNow that you know where (not) to work, here\u2019s how much you can expect your pay to rise this year. A report published this week by Mercer estimates that salary increments in 2025 will be an average 9.4 per cent, a steady growth from 8 per cent in 2020. The automotive sector is expected to be the most generous, with 10 per cent salary increments (up from 8.8 per cent last year), followed by manufacturing and engineering at 9.7 per cent. Of the 1,550 companies that participated in this survey, 37 per cent plan to increase headcount.\n\nOverall, these are encouraging numbers. The jobs landscape for 2025 is looking good in India. But Delhi-ites, should we start a support group?\n\nWrite to me at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply.\n\nOn Monday, when Donald Trump takes his oath of office, one section of Indian industry will be watching with hopeful anticipation. The IT services sector, which has had a difficult few years post-pandemic, is looking forward to a Trump bump. Here\u2019s why.\n\nOne, Trump has promised to reduce corporate taxes. Industry experts expect that the money saved on tax will be directed towards technology expansion. Second, the uncertainty over the elections are over and the US economy is expected to grow. Half of India\u2019s IT services revenues come from North America and when the US grows, they grow too. In fact, it\u2019s already showing signs of a revival (see graph above). HSBC analysts estimate industry growth will be 6 per cent in the next financial year, up from about 3-4 per cent over the past two years.\n\nOur IT services companies employ 5mn people and earn revenues of $125bn, and it needs all the good news it can get. But a Trump presidency is not without its challenges for the industry. The issue of H1B visas has been raging even before Trump takes office. The president\u2019s Maga base has come out all guns blazing against IT jobs going predominantly to Indians. Plus, the nuances of the US economy in 2025 are hazy. If the new administration imposes the tariffs it has been threatening, inflationary pressures will rise.\n\nThis is a story which should not be viewed through a binary lens. My sense is that all of these scenarios will come to bear. There will be more money funding technology services but there will also be the overhang of Trump\u2019s America First policies. The next few quarters will probably be positive for the industry, but it would be foolish to extrapolate that to the entirety of Trump\u2019s term.\n\nIndia\u2019s trade deficit narrowed to a three-month low last month. Key imports were precious metals, petroleum and electronics. The government revised November\u2019s gold import figures by $5bn, attributing it to a mistake of double counting. Here\u2019s the data for December.\n\nI plan to start watching Black Warrant on Netflix this weekend. Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, this is an inside look at Delhi\u2019s notorious Tihar jail. The series is based on the book of the same name, written by Sunil Gupta, a former superintendent at the prison, and journalist Sunetra Choudhury. I read the book when it was published in 2019. It\u2019s a gripping account with familiar names from newspaper headlines. Early reviews of the show are promising.\n\nMy friend (and former boss) Sanjay Kalra sent me a playlist of Rashid Khan\u2019s songs. I don\u2019t know much about Hindustani classical, but these songs were accessible even for my musically-challenged brain. I plan to properly get into it this weekend. (Write to me if you\u2019re interested. I\u2019ll share the playlist).\n\nThe Indian national trust for art and cultural heritage (Intach) organises some lovely walks in Delhi. It\u2019s a great opportunity to learn about the history and culture of this beautiful city. (So what if we are underpaid, we get to gaze at Humayun\u2019s tomb). After two failed attempts, when I registered but couldn\u2019t make it, I\u2019m hoping to be third-time lucky and go on an Afghan food walk with them on Saturday evening. Fingers crossed for some naan and kebabs.\n\nWhat are adventure enthusiasts fuelling themselves with in order to be able to summit Mount Everest in one week?\n\nSend your answer to indiabrief@ft.com and check Tuesday\u2019s newsletter to see if you were the first one to get it right.\n\nOn Monday we asked: How many hours of work are ideal in a week? Here are the results \u2014 I see that none of you agree with S. N. Subrahmanyan. My colleague John Reed has also weighed in on the viral remarks by Larsen & Toubro\u2019s chief executive.\n\nAnd also, now that all three results are out, see if you got last week\u2019s poll right.\n\nThank you for reading.

In doing so he sparked a furore by touching on twin obsessions of the country\u2019s professional class: long work hours and their toll on family life.\n\n\u201cI regret I am not able to make you work on Sundays, to be honest,\u201d the chair of the conglomerate Larsen & Toubro told staff in a corporate town hall event in Mumbai.\n\n\u201cIf I could make you work on Sundays, I would be more happy because I work on Sundays also.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you do sitting at home?\u201d he added. \u201cHow long can you stare at your wife, how long can the wife stare at her husband? Come on, get to the office and start working.\u201d\n\nThough the meeting was meant to stay within company walls, a video was published on Reddit and then shared widely online, to Indians\u2019 widespread outrage and bemusement.\n\nThis is not the first time a business leader has admonished employees in India for the hours they work.\n\nNR Narayana Murthy, chair of outsourcing giant Infosys, invited similar controversy last year after calling on India\u2019s youth to work 70 hours a week to compete with the likes of China, and urged them to avoid picking up \u201cnot-so-desirable habits from the west\u201d.\n\nBack in 2011 the late Ratan Tata, chair of the Tata Group, questioned the work ethic of British managers after his group\u2019s acquisitions of Jaguar Land Rover and Corus, claiming \u201cnobody is willing to go the extra mile\u201d.\n\nIn a country with a conservative government that prizes consensus and bristles at criticism, Indian corporate bosses tend to keep public statements workmanlike and patriotic, if not studiously bland.\n\nSubrahmanyan\u2019s comments have prompted attention for their frank outspokenness and reference to staring at one\u2019s wife, which some Indians found bizarre and which helped the video to go viral.\n\n\u201cHe made it sound as if being at home and being with your spouse is a terrible waste of time,\u201d said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder of Teamlease, an Indian staffing company.\n\nSome uxorious Indian men have in recent days posted pictures of themselves staring lovingly at their wives; others rechristened Sunday as \u201cStareday\u201d, which is now circulating online as a hashtag.\n\nLeading Indian chief executives have piled on \u2014 some perhaps sensing an opportunity for virtue-signalling or schadenfreude.\n\n\u201cMy wife is wonderful,\u201d Anand Mahindra, CEO of the eponymous family conglomerate, said at a conference this week in New Delhi. \u201cI love staring at her.\u201d\n\nMahindra added that the debate that had been unleashed was \u201cin the wrong direction\u201d and should be about the quality of work, not the quantity.\n\nLarsen & Toubro has largely sat out the controversy, initially backing its chair in a statement saying that \u201cextraordinary outcomes require extraordinary effort\u201d. Colleagues say he was not serious. Subrahmanyan has declined to comment.\n\nThe question of how many hours executives in India should work has led to serious debates about the country\u2019s economic growth.\n\nAway from the online japes and memes, Subrahmanyan\u2019s comments touched a nerve because India\u2019s hard-working professionals are feeling the pinch from persistent inflation and stagnating wages. These in turn feed often-voiced fears that India \u2014 no matter how hard or long people work \u2014 is heading for a \u201cmiddle income trap\u201d, in which its huge population grows old before the economy becomes rich.\n\nWhile reliable data is not available on India\u2019s average working hours, long commutes running to two or three hours both ways are common in Indian cities.\n\nRajiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Auto, said Indian companies should move away from \u201carchaic and regressive policies\u201d of enforcing long working hours and instead focus on \u201cspeed at the front line\u201d.\n\nOthers were more forthright. \u201c90 hours a week?\u201d Harsh Goenka, chair of RPG Group, fumed in a post on X. \u201cWhy not rename Sunday to \u2018Sun-duty\u2019 and make \u2018day off\u2019 a mythical concept!\u201d\n\njohn.reed@ft.com", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/96aefd59-e079-40ae-a334-03c53d02d6a0"}, {"title": "Gods, Guns and Missionaries \u2014 exploding the myth of a singular, \u2018true\u2019 Hinduism", "description": "Manu S Pillai\u2019s deft exploration of four centuries of the faith reveals its underlying complexities", "author": "Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan", "published_date": "2025-01-15T12:43:42.208Z", "content": "A book about Hinduism which begins with a maharaja\u2019s cows sounds a little like a Rudyard Kipling tale, replete with spices, mystery and \u201cbackward\u201d traditions. But in the hands of Manu S Pillai, Madho Singh II\u2019s journey from Jaipur in the west of India to imperial London for Edward VII\u2019s coronation in 1902 becomes the gateway to a deft exploration of what Hinduism actually means as a faith. Drawing on the lives of missionaries, maharajas and men of the Dutch, French and British East India Companies, Pillai builds the story of a system marked by adaptability, dynamism and compromise rather than ossified archaisms.\n\nHinduism is often imagined as a monolith of arcane and ancient rituals, in spite of the efforts of external invaders. In India itself, the image of a \u201cfaith under siege\u201d is a core part of the Hindu nationalist rhetoric wielded by the Bharatiya Janata party \u2014 a party that has now led the world\u2019s most populous nation for more than a decade.\n\nExploring four crucial centuries of Hinduism\u2019s often terse, sometimes violent and always complex relationship with other faiths, Pillai explodes the myth of a singular, unchanging, \u201ctrue\u201d Hinduism. At the same time, he lays out the factors that allowed Hindu nationalists to forge a seemingly singular, muscular identity which has come to define Hinduism for many in the 21st century.\n\nHe argues that even before the arrival of imperial powers, Hinduism was hardly a settled affair, emerging instead from \u201c[Brahmins\u2019] negotiations with a bewildering variety of counter-thoughts and alternate visions\u201d. India\u2019s priestly class was not unified, adds Pillai, adapting to local traditions ranging from sun worship to matrilineal succession as needed.\n\nMatters only become more complicated with the arrival of Europeans in India at the end of the 15th century. Early travelogues read rather like a rejected Indiana Jones script, full of human sacrifice, demon worship and libidinous, treacherous women. Vasco da Gama, upon arriving in Kerala in 1498, was less quick to judge: he entered a Hindu temple and participated in rituals, dismissing frescoes of \u201cmulti-armed beings with big teeth\u201d as local forms of saints. And as some priests engaged with Brahmins, they found that the trappings of many gods were simply a humanised vision of something more akin to a familiar and orthodox monotheism. A recognition of spiritual kinship led Italian missionary Roberto de Nobili to swap his cassock for the robes of local priests in an effort to better win over converts.\n\nNot all interactions were so harmonious. Portuguese padres in Goa, facing the pressure of the Reformation at home, clamped down on \u201cpaganism\u201d abroad by burning temples. One, Father Acquaviva, disappointed at the tolerance he found at the court of Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great, received his desired martyrdom after erecting a cross at a destroyed Hindu temple. The British East India Company shifted from distrust of missionaries as an impediment to trade to support for its \u201ccivilising\u201d mission thanks to pious parliamentarians and pressure groups. Among the catalysts for the Great Rebellion of 1857, Pillai argues, were evangelicals waving Christian texts at Hindu festivals.\n\nThe message throughout is that Hinduism is a living tradition defined more by variation than a singularity of thought and that those who would come to call themselves \u201cHindus\u201d were more than passive subjects. Priests and potentates reshaped their beliefs in ways deemed more acceptable or sophisticated, consciously rewriting older texts to remove imagery considered embarrassing for the mores of the time. Their discussions with colonial powers were not merely those of vassals lapping up to masters, but of reflective thinkers adapting to a shifting world.\n\nPillai also explores the shaping of Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) identity and how outside pressures knitted a huge variety of traditions into something like a unified whole (albeit imperfectly). The history of conquerors is central to a kind of postcolonial paranoia that sees Hindus\u2019 failure to resist as rooted in their naivety and good nature. The required remedy to resist cultural annihilation, proponents say, is to adopt an equally belligerent stance, bringing all the faithful into the fold.\n\nPillai avoids straying into the present; there are no references to the BJP or Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the text ends (chronologically) in 2003 with the unveiling of a portrait of Vinayak Savarkar, the father of Hindutva. This is not a weakness: to end with a deep dive into the BJP would suggest that the now prevalent nationalist vision of Hinduism is the religion\u2019s \u201cend point\u201d rather than a single strain.\n\nThe book closes with Bijay Chand Mahtab, maharaja of Burdwan, almost informing the pope of the \u201crevolting\u201d idolatry of Madonna shrines in early 20th century Italy. That inversion of early monstrous travelogues is more than a reminder of the underlying complexities of Hinduism; it also reflects the deep similarities between faiths. Those parallels were visible in the Enlightenment and earlier, but are increasingly at risk in an age of narrow populist agendas worldwide.\n\nGods, Guns and Missionaries: The Making of the Modern Hindu Identity by Manu S Pillai Allen Lane \u00a335, 624 pages\n\nJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Caf\u00e9 and follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/04cbeb04-ad5d-4452-bfa5-612fb86e2c20"}, {"title": "Weakening rupee puts India interest rate cuts in doubt", "description": "Currency\u2019s decline and its implications for inflation add to doubts about health of world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy", "author": "Chris Kay", "published_date": "2025-01-15T05:00:27.295Z", "content": "A drop in the value of India\u2019s rupee has shaken expectations that the new head of the central bank will quickly cut interest rates to stimulate the country\u2019s flagging economy.\n\nThe currency has repeatedly hit lows and a 0.7 per cent fall against the dollar on Monday was its biggest one-day dip in nearly two years.\n\nThat decline and its implications for inflation have shattered the previously near-uniform consensus among economists that Reserve Bank of India governor Sanjay Malhotra and fellow monetary policy setters will next month cut the benchmark repo rate from 6.5 per cent, the level it has been held at for nearly two years.\n\nThe falling rupee is only one of a number of indicators taking the shine off of what remains the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy.\n\nIndia registered a sharp drop in year-on-year GDP growth to 5.4 per cent in the quarter through to the end of September, the lowest level in nearly two years, amid a slowdown in government spending, waning consumption and weak corporate earnings.\n\n\u201cThe rupee fall is serious for the new RBI governor,\u201d said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, adding that it had \u201cmuddied the view\u201d that there would be a headline rate cut at Malhotra\u2019s first policy meeting, which opens just a few days after the central government lays out its annual budget on February 1.\n\n\u201cA freefall has implications for imported inflation and hence monetary policy, which is the conundrum,\u201d Sabnavis said.\n\nIndia relies on overseas suppliers for almost 90 per cent of its oil consumption, making it particularly vulnerable to a rise in crude prices that followed new US sanctions on Russian producers. Robust recent US economic data has also cast doubt on the need for the Federal Reserve to lower rates, helping strengthen the dollar.\n\nStubbornly persistent inflation, which has eroded the spending power of hundreds of millions of poor and middle-class Indian households, lies at the heart of the RBI\u2019s dilemma.\n\nFuelled by soaring vegetable prices, headline inflation breached the upper 6 per cent limit of the central bank\u2019s target band in October, though prices have since cooled with the rate slowing to 5.2 per cent in December.\n\nMalhotra, who took office last month, had said he expected India\u2019s economy to recover in 2025. He indicated the RBI would prioritise supporting \u201ca higher growth path\u201d after his predecessor Shaktikanta Das was criticised by the government for keeping borrowing costs elevated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy environment for the new governor,\u201d said Trinh Nguyen, emerging Asia economist at Natixis, adding that \u201cIndia is not alone in this conundrum\u201d with most developing nations suffering from the strong dollar. \u201cBut fundamentally, I think growth will prevail as a priority even if a rapidly weakening rupee is a concern.\u201d\n\nThe RBI has regularly intervened to prop up the currency, burning through almost $70bn of its foreign exchange reserves since they reached a record high of $705bn in September.\n\nSome economists speculate that the more recent lack of strong RBI action to stem the rupee\u2019s fall may mark a shift in stance under Malhotra towards a more market-driven view of the currency that could boost exports. The RBI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOther experts are more sanguine about the impact of the rupee\u2019s decline and believe the RBI has plenty of room to manoeuvre given an overall trend of declining inflation and the central bank\u2019s still considerable reserves.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as big a deal as it\u2019s being made out to be,\u201d said Miguel Chanco, chief emerging Asia economist at research consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. The rupee\u2019s more than 4 per cent depreciation against the dollar over the past year remained \u201cfairly manageable\u201d, Chanco said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that it\u2019s probably been due a downshift for some time, having looked pricey on a real effective exchange rate basis over the past 18 months or so,\u201d he said.\n\nMore broadly, while the RBI and India\u2019s government last month slashed their growth forecasts for the coming year to their lowest since the Covid-19 pandemic, the central bank said the economy was showing signs of bottoming out.\n\nChanco said that view might be too optimistic, given that India\u2019s fiscal and monetary policy remained tight, households were weighed down with debt and industrial capacity utilisation still was not at levels high enough to spark a fresh cycle of investment.\n\n\u201cWe probably have at least one more big downshift in headline GDP growth,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, another economist said the rebound in government capital expenditure that had been put on hold during last year\u2019s general election could also bode well for a revival of the Indian economy in the months to come.\n\n\u201cStructurally the economy is resilient,\u201d said Poonam Gupta, director-general of the National Council of Applied Economic Research in New Delhi. \u201cIt\u2019s a cyclical slowdown which timely policy actions can easily reverse.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/68250775-1c6d-4652-8423-89d55deeba45"}, {"title": "Indian IT outsourcers look to Trump bump to revive fortunes", "description": "After years of anaemic growth in largest market, sector expects promised deregulation to encourage tech spending", "author": "Krishn Kaushik", "published_date": "2025-01-14T05:00:51.366Z", "content": "India\u2019s vast information technology outsourcing sector is hoping for a revival of its fortunes under a second Donald Trump presidency, with an industry that derives more than half its revenues from the US expecting incentives for its customers there to increase spending.\n\nWith the new administration promising to slash corporate taxes and tame red tape, India\u2019s $128bn annual revenue back office and consultancy sector, with its huge campuses across cities from Bengaluru to Pune, sees opportunity in its largest market after years of anaemic demand and growth. \u201cMr Trump in the past has been very business savvy,\u201d said Atul Soneja, chief operating officer at Tech Mahindra \u2014 the IT business of the Mahindra Group conglomerate \u2014 in an interview in Bengaluru. \u201cWe should hopefully start seeing the benefit.\u201d\n\nIT and business process outsourcing is one of India\u2019s most important and global-facing industries, employing more than 5mn people in a country that has thus far been unable to provide large numbers of well-paid and formal job opportunities for its enormous labour force.\n\nThe sector enjoyed a surge of business as clients invested in digital services during the coronavirus pandemic. But that led to Indian tech giants becoming bloated after a hiring splurge, and the industry was hit as corporates cut back on spending with global economic pressures increasing.\n\nTata Consultancy Services, India\u2019s largest IT company, which last week reported a fifth straight decline in quarterly revenue in North America, expects a better year, in part due to improving client spending as Trump takes office this week.\n\n\u201cOnce the new administration comes in, that will also remove any uncertainty,\u201d said K Krithivasan, TCS chief executive. \u201cThere will be more confidence in discretionary programmes coming into the next financial year.\u201d\n\nNandan Nilekani, the billionaire co-founder and chair of India\u2019s second-largest IT services company Infosys, told the Financial Times in November that the \u201cbull case\u201d for the industry would be that Trump\u2019s presidency would \u201cunleash market deregulation\u201d, allowing companies to expand, while spurring more mergers and takeovers, all providing business to India\u2019s outsourcers.\n\nHis comments were echoed soon after by Rishad Premji, chair of rival Wipro, who said he believed Trump\u2019s administration would be \u201cvery pro-business and pro-growth, which helps all of our customers, which ultimately helps partners here in India and the world over\u201d.\n\nHSBC analysts estimate the industry will see growth accelerate to 6 per cent in the next financial year, up from about 3-4 per cent over the past two years, adding that the US outlook is now positive.\n\n\u201cAny tax cuts would drive more technology spending, that\u2019s a fair assumption,\u201d said Sid Pai, the Bengaluru-based co-founder of venture capital tech investor Siana Capital Management, who expected \u201csteady growth\u201d across the sector.\n\nThe renewed optimism comes as US tech executives have been beating a path to India in recent months. Last week, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella set forth a $3bn investment, while in October, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang came to Mumbai and announced a batch of artificial intelligence partnerships with the country\u2019s biggest conglomerates and outsourcing giants.However, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d protectionist stance promises to impose dramatic tariffs on countries \u2014 damaging growth, fuelling inflation and leading to the Federal Reserve being more cautious on lowering interest rates, according to a recent FT poll of more than 220 economists.\u201cA large part of demand recovery for IT services companies is dependent on how the US economy performs in 2025,\u201d said Kumar Rakesh, a Mumbai-based associate director of equity research at BNP Paribas, warning conditions for the sector could worsen if policy changes were to boost inflation and force a pause or even a reversal in rate cuts.HSBC analysts noted that Trump tax cuts in 2017 did not necessarily have a clear impact on tech spending. During the last Trump presidency, the industry also fell foul of tightening restrictions on the high-skilled H-1B visa programme, which is overwhelmingly used by Indian nationals.\n\nWhile Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s biggest tech industry backer, has argued there is \u201ca dire shortage\u201d of IT engineers in America, Indian outsourcers have since significantly reduced their dependency on H1-B workers in the US where they have offices servicing clients locally. Rakesh said less than 1 per cent of outsourcing industry employees now work on such visas. More widely, economists and industry figures in India expect the world\u2019s most populous nation, which has been edging closer into Washington\u2019s orbit and whose leader, Narendra Modi, shares good relations with Trump, could be shielded from the worst of the US leader\u2019s impulses.\n\n\u201cThe relationships between the two leaders have been very strong in the past as well, so we expect that to continue,\u201d said Tech Mahindra\u2019s Soneja.Teresa John, deputy head of research at Mumbai brokerage Nirmal Bang, who recently published research on the potential impact of \u201cTrumponomics\u201d on India, said overall the country was likely to \u201cbe relatively insulated\u201d compared with other Asian nations, such as China, given its lower trade surplus with the US.\n\n\u201cUS growth is going to hold up,\u201d she added. \u201cWe will see that flowing through to the Indian IT sector.\u201d", "tag": "india?page=1", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c41220a4-d37b-4323-a7cc-4e56eb0ae910"}, {"title": "Infosys and Cognizant slug it out", "description": "Also in this newsletter: Real money games get a breather and the Kumbh Mela in numbers", "author": "Veena Venugopal", "published_date": "2025-01-14T01:30:50.376Z", "content": "Good morning. India\u2019s inflation for December was 5.22 per cent, a four-month low, thanks to some moderation in food prices. While the trend is encouraging, it is much higher than the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s medium-term target of 4 per cent. Is this enough for a rate cut next month?\n\nIn today\u2019s newsletter, we take a look at the real money gaming industry, which got a small breather on Friday when the Supreme Court asked for a temporary pause in tax proceedings against 49 companies. But first, the war of titans: India\u2019s software service giants Infosys and Cognizant slug it out in a court in Texas.\n\nThe battle between two Indian(ish) technology majors escalated, with Infosys, on Friday, filing a counter lawsuit against Cognizant. This is the story so far: in August 2024,\u00a0Cognizant subsidiary TriZetto, which provides technology services to the US healthcare industry, took Infosys to court. It accused Infosys of building a competing program by unlawfully extracting data from its proprietary software. Now, five months later, Infosys has come out all guns blazing, not only rejecting these accusations but also levelling charges of anti-competitive practices against its rival.\n\nInfosys, in its counter suit, alleges that Cognizant obstructed the development of its healthcare platform (Helix) by poaching key personnel and placing restrictive contractual barriers. The suit specifically alleges that Ravi Kumar, who quit Infosys in October 2022 and became Cognizant\u2019s chief executive four months later, deliberately delayed the launch of Helix while he was transitioning to his new job. Infosys is seeking a jury trial and has demanded three times the damages it allegedly suffered, plus legal costs.\n\nInfosys and Cognizant have long been rivals, fighting over both client contracts as well as employees. These lawsuits also highlight the intensely competitive landscape in which Indian IT companies operate in the US, with little differentiation in the services they provide. Much is at stake for both companies. A protracted legal battle serves neither\u2019s interests, but since things have got this far, a quick retreat by either party also looks unlikely.\n\nDo you have an inside scoop on this? Write to me at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply.\n\nReal money gaming, a sector which hasn\u2019t had any good news in a while, got a breather on Friday when the Supreme Court placed a temporary halt on tax proceedings that would have cost 49 companies a whopping Rs1.1tn (about $14bn). Stocks of Delta Corp and OnMobile, which both run platforms that allow users to play games such as rummy for actual money, rose by 6.44 per cent and 2.38 per cent respectively on the news. But this is just a temporary reprieve, with the final hearing set for March 18.\n\nFor years, flush with funds and abundant user interest, real money gaming companies lobbied hard to convince the government that these were games of skill, and not of chance, a distinction that allowed them to fall in the 18 per cent tax rate. But in October 2023, the finance ministry grouped these games together with lotteries and gambling.\u00a0Not only would the companies have to start paying tax at 28 per cent, the tax would be computed on the value of the bet \u2014 not just on the winnings. The companies argue that the high rate of tax will lead to a surge in unauthorised gaming as operators go underground.\n\nThere are two significant factors at play. First, online gambling is a serious societal issue \u2014 one with devastating consequences especially in the low-income sections of the population. Second, in general, sin taxes are a populist tool in the government\u2019s arsenal and it is more likely to use them than not. While real money gaming is a big business opportunity and India\u2019s affluent are keen on spending money on it, the government\u2019s preference will be to regulate for the larger good.\n\nIn the aftermath of the government\u2019s October 2023 decision, several companies decided to move their headquarters outside India. This might just be the one industry the government is not going to invest heavily in luring back.\n\nThe Maha Kumbh, which comes around once every 12 years, started yesterday and will continue until February 26. Here are some mind-boggling stats about the world\u2019s largest spiritual congregation.\n\nEach week, we invite a top Indian business leader to tell us their mantra for work and life.
