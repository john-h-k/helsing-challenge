It completed the four reactors of its Barakah nuclear power plant, the first in the Arab world, in under 12 years, and on budget. The project was developed in partnership with Korea Electric Power Corp.The company, known as Enec, has built up investment and research and development teams to explore opportunities beyond the UAE, chief executive Mohamed Al Hammadi told the Financial Times. AI is set to drive a surge in demand for electricity to power data centres.\n\n\u201cWe are interested in all markets, very very interested,\u201d Al Hammadi said. \u201cWe want to capitalise on our success and we are looking at what we can do: build in the UAE, outside the UAE, the whole market.\u201d\n\nRoughly a quarter of the UAE\u2019s electricity is now generated from nuclear power and up to 60 per cent in the winter when demand for air conditioning drops, Al Hammadi said.\n\n\u201cWho has done what we did in the last 10 years?\u201d said Al Hammadi, who also chairs the World Nuclear Association. \u201cI will not compete with China or Korea, but if you look from here [the Middle East] to the west, we are the only ones.\u201d\n\nEnec has been in discussions to invest in the UK\u2019s Sizewell C project but Al Hammadi declined to comment on whether the company would proceed, only saying that negotiations had \u201cbeen going through different cycles in the last year\u201d.\n\nThe UK has pushed back the final investment decision on Sizewell, which was expected last year, to after the next government spending review expected in the spring, while the estimated cost of the project has doubled from less than five years ago.\n\nAl Hammadi suggested that the US is seeing the fastest growth in demand for nuclear power because of the boom in AI computing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s much faster growth in energy demand, with the US leading in AI, and I think we are at the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the available energy in the US has been consumed over the last 18 to 19 months, and that is why they are even going after brownfield sites to restart some old [nuclear] units.\u201d\n\nAsked if he wanted to build, own and operate nuclear power stations, invest in projects or be hired as a consultant, Al Hammadi said: \u201cAll of the above.\u201d He said he was agnostic about whether Enec invests in reviving old reactors, large-scale projects or small modular reactors.\n\n\u201cWe have the institutional knowledge, we know how to structure deals, how to stitch them together and become a qualified, smart owner and how to manage these very complex projects, deliver them on time and also on budget,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also suggested the UAE could play a role in building nuclear power stations in the global south. This month the gulf state signed a $15bn agreement for renewable projects in the Philippines, which is also in talks with Enec over a potential nuclear power station.\n\n\u201cWe are in an advanced stage of passing a regulatory framework for nuclear and that will help us carry out our plan to have nuclear power,\u201d Raphael Lotilla, the Philippines\u2019 energy minister, said in an interview in Abu Dhabi.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f949780a-3eb2-44f2-9db1-f69ce16161b7"}}, {"id": "e1d4fbe5-15c6-45f2-9a09-c435e630fdae", "event_name": "Pakistan to seek extradition of billionaire tycoon from UAE", "blurb": "Developer Malik Riaz Hussain says fraud allegations by anti-corruption watchdog are attempt to \u2018blackmail\u2019 him ", "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Pakistan is to request the extradition of the billionaire property tycoon Malik Riaz Hussain from the United Arab Emirates, targeting a powerful businessman linked to the jailed former prime minister Imran Khan.\n\nThe National Accountability Bureau, Pakistan\u2019s anti-corruption watchdog, said Hussain was being investigated \u201cfor fraud, deceptive practices and cheating [the] public at large\u201d.\n\nHussain, the owner of Bahria Town, Pakistan\u2019s largest privately held real estate development company, had sold land for which he lacked ownership approval permits, the bureau said on Tuesday.\n\nAnalysts said the case was a major setback for a man once considered politically untouchable and that it suggested Pakistan\u2019s military and government wanted to issue a warning to other influential figures with ties to Khan, who was toppled from government in 2022 but remains popular.\n\nKhan was sentenced to 14 years in prison last week after being convicted of illegally accepting land for an education institution from Hussain. Khan and his lawyers say the trial is a politically motivated attempt by the country\u2019s military to banish him from the political arena.\n\nIn a statement posted on the social media site X on Wednesday, Hussain suggested the extradition announcement was an attempt to pressure him to testify in court.\n\nHe said he had been subject to \u201cyears of blackmailing, fake cases and greed of officers\u201d and had been forced to move abroad because of his principle stance of \u201crefusing to be a witness (political pawn)\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo matter how much you oppress me, Malik Riaz will not testify!\u201d the billionaire wrote. The \u201cdeplorable press release by NAB is actually a new demand for blackmail. I am resisting, but I am sitting with a storm in my heart.\u201d\n\nAs well as saying Pakistan would seek the extradition of Hussain, who has lived in exile in the UAE since 2023, the accountability bureau warned that investors in an Emirati apartment project he launched earlier this month could risk facing money-laundering charges.\n\nMichael Kugelman, a fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington, said the action against Hussain suggested a desire among Pakistani authorities to \u201cshow the credibility of the case against Khan\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut at its core I think it\u2019s about widening the dragnet being pursued against all those with influence that have links to Khan,\u201d Kugelman added, pointing to the Pakistan military\u2019s current court martial of Faiz Hameed, a former spymaster said to have been close to Khan when he was prime minister.\n\nThrough Bahria Town, Hussain has since 1997 built vast housing developments outside Pakistan\u2019s major cities that have become dream neighbourhoods for members of the aspirational middle class.\n\nEarlier this month, he inaugurated a new head office for BT Properties, a Bahria Town subsidiary that is developing properties in Dubai South, a planned suburb in the city\u2019s rapidly urbanising inland areas.\n\n\u201cWe are not just entering Dubai\u2019s real estate market \u2014 we are here to lead,\u201d Hussain said at the opening ceremony.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s foreign ministry declined to comment. Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Bahria Town pointed to Hussain\u2019s social media post as the company\u2019s stance.\n\nIn 2019, the UK National Crime Agency secured a deal with Hussain and his family under which they agreed to hand over \u00a3190mn held in the country.\n\nThe payout put an end to an NCA investigation in relation to the funds. The agency did not disclose the allegations that had led to freezing orders on the assets, but said the deal was a civil, rather than a criminal matter, and \u201cdoes not represent a finding of guilt\u201d.\n\nThe \u00a3190mn was returned to Pakistan, but the current government alleges Hussain was allowed to keep it in exchange for the illegal land transfer to Khan.

His companion, a blonde air hostess, fell off her stool.\n\nThis absurd moment has come to feel like something of an omen. Bona fide millionaires \u2014 possibly possessing some fame and power, but definitely a lot of money \u2014 have flocked to the Middle East\u2019s commercial hub in the past year. Wealth advisory firm Henley & Partners estimated that 6,700 millionaires would arrive in the United Arab Emirates in 2024, more than any other global destination.\n\nFor Dubai, whose boom and bust property market is in an unprecedented rally, this is a victory. Long pitching itself as a luxury lifestyle destination, Dubai has \u201calways wanted to be Monaco and Singapore\u201d, said one banker, \u201cand that\u2019s the direction it\u2019s headed in\u201d.\u00a0Business owners say the city, once awash with chancers and dodgy cash, now has plenty of real talent and legitimate money.\n\nDubai has cracked the millionaire market, then. But the Monaco of the Middle East may now have to turn its attention to the middle class.\n\n\u201cThe arrival of the ultra-wealthy has created more options for people to spend large amounts of money,\u201d said one expat who recently left for Europe after nearly two decades. \u201cBut it\u2019s also made people feel much poorer.\u201d\n\nThe moneyed global citizens filling expensive restaurants and buying beachside villas, plus a rush of workers wanting to cash in on Dubai\u2019s boom, have put a strain on the city\u2019s housing market, causing problems for families with lower incomes.\n\nDubai is now the world\u2019s 15th most expensive city to live in, according to a global ranking by consultancy Mercer, and has the region\u2019s highest cost of living. In 2020, it ranked at number 22 globally. British Mums, an online expat community, estimated last year that a family needed a monthly income of AED50,000 (around $13,600) to live comfortably here.\n\nThe costs are not yet putting people off. Dubai remains a magnet for migrants drawn by the glamour, absence of income tax, glorious winter weather and stability of the UAE\u2019s 10-year \u201cgolden visa\u201d programme.\n\nBut rising rents are biting. Property laws shield tenants from price-gouging to a certain extent, but rents have climbed so much overall \u2014 on average, over 20 per cent per year for the last two, according to Mercer \u2014 that many long-term residents face trading down. A friend who used to live in a villa with a garden has moved to a one-bedroom flat.\n\nDubai Land Department acknowledged the rise in housing demand but said it monitored real estate to ensure a balanced housing supply and had taken steps to help residents \u201cacross diverse income groups\u201d.\n\nThere is unlikely to be much sympathy for white-collar workers who profited handsomely in the past. Renting in Dubai may be more expensive than, say, Paris or Frankfurt, but Mercer\u2019s data shows it is still broadly cheaper than the financial hubs of London and Singapore.\n\n\u201cNot everyone can afford to live in Chelsea,\u201d said Dubai-based real estate agent Barnaby Crompton, citing the London market. \u201cYou have other areas where the diaspora are moving because they\u2019re being priced out of the more centrally located places.\u201d\n\nLower-paid employees \u2014 the drivers, waiters, cleaners and other vital workers who keep the sparkling city running \u2014 are squeezed into ever tighter accommodation further out or have less money to send to families.\n\nExpat message boards show plenty of debate over whether it still pays to stay in Dubai. \u201cRent and costs of education, health etc are making us believe that London might be better,\u201d wrote one. \u201cFinancially it might be breaking even due to tax, but we\u2019d be with our families and old friends.\u201d\n\nMany come to Dubai in the expectation of finding fame, power or money. The reality, as the recently departed expat complained, can be different. \u201cBeyond the glitz and glamour, there\u2019s a lot of tears and sorrow in Dubai.\u201d\n\nchloe.cornish@ft.ccom", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a6319d09-9691-43c2-854c-9e709722bfb6"}}, {"id": "d713a9ef-5eef-4378-a89f-639f873b9ee5", "event_name": "\u2018Donald of Dubai\u2019: real estate mogul rubbing shoulders with Trump", "blurb": "Hussain Sajwani has built swaths of the Middle East\u2019s glitziest commercial hub and made an ally of the US president-elect", "date": "2025-01-1400:00:00.0", "body": "When Emirati billionaire Hussain Sajwani casually mentioned to his long-term business partner Donald Trump over dinner that he planned to expand into US data centres, the president-elect sensed an opportunity.\n\n\u201cHe says, \u2018I have a press conference in a few days, and I would like to announce that\u2019,\u201d Sajwani said in a Financial Times interview last week in his villa on Dubai\u2019s man-made Palm \u2014 a symbol of the entrepot\u2019s excess and its appeal to global millionaires, from footballers to former warlords.\n\nAt a Mar-a-Lago press conference this month the world\u2019s most powerful man described Sajwani as a \u201cgreat investor\u201d, as the pair stood side by side to announce a $20bn planned investment. This put a global spotlight on the Emirati entrepreneur, who started in food services and has built swaths of the Middle East\u2019s glitzy commercial hub through his company Damac, Dubai\u2019s biggest private residential developer.\n\nThe plan to spend $20bn over four years appears aspirational. Sajwani\u2019s data centre company Edgnex does not yet have any contracts with tenants for their 2000MW of planned US data centres. The company, established in 2021, is close to having 15MW of operational data centres in Saudi Arabia and Thailand. The investment would be a large sum for Damac, which had $5bn in cash on its balance sheet as of June last year.\n\nSajwani says he expects to rely largely on bank loans to finance the plans, adding that the $20bn figure was estimated from \u201chow much we think we can take from management time, land acquisition and our own capability of our own balance sheet\u201d.\n\nSometimes called \u201cthe Donald of Dubai\u201d, Sajwani is regarded as an outsider by the city\u2019s business community. Belonging to the minority Shia Muslim sect, he is seen as a hard-charging risk taker who has clung on to the rollercoaster of Dubai\u2019s boom-and-bust property market. \u201cThe old [Dubai] families don\u2019t really like him,\u201d said a Dubai-based executive who has worked with Sajwani.\n\nInstead, the real estate mogul has found a US ally. Sajwani and Trump have known each other since 2011 when Damac and the Trump Organization built the first Trump-branded golf course in the Middle East.\n\nPlans for a second, Tiger Woods-designed links in Dubai have foundered, Sajwani said, although the project remains on the Trump Organization\u2019s website. Nonetheless, the families have stayed connected: Trump\u2019s sons attended Sajwani\u2019s daughter\u2019s wedding, and Sajwani said their wives had become friends.\n\nThe Emirati tycoon has ties elsewhere in Trump\u2019s inner circle. He has invested in Elon Musks\u2019 SpaceX and xAI. The 72-year-old was pictured alongside both men at Trump\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve celebration.\n\nSince the Dubai Trump International golf course, the Trump Organization has sold its name to developments with other partners in the region: a resort in Oman is under construction, while two towers \u2014 one in Saudi Arabia\u2019s second city Jeddah and another in Dubai \u2014 are planned.\n\nThese Middle Eastern business ties have raised questions about potential conflicts of interest for the president-elect, although he has stepped away from the Trump Organization.\n\nTrump\u2019s sons, who run the conglomerate, are hoping to capitalise on the strong post-Covid economic growth in the autocratic, hydrocarbon-rich Gulf region. \u201cIf you\u2019re a developer, Dubai is almost a playground for you,\u201d said Eric Trump in an FT interview last year, calling the region\u2019s growth \u201cexplosive\u201d.\n\nDubai\u2019s latest boom has sent Damac\u2019s sales soaring. Revenue for the six months to June 2024, the latest Damac Real Estate accounts available, hit $1.4bn, more than doubling from $690mn for the same period the previous year. Profit before tax jumped to $456mn, up from $297mn.\n\nSoftly spoken Sajwani, whose net worth Forbes puts at more than $5bn, is the son of a market trader and door-to-door saleswoman. Local businesspeople remember his first venture in the 1980s as a fast-food outlet in a mall. Sajwani then started an industrial catering company, and bought land and property in Dubai as it was establishing itself as a regional hub in the 1990s. He founded Damac in 2002.\n\nThe company barely survived the 2008 global financial crisis, and the bursting of Dubai\u2019s property bubble.\u00a0\u201cWe were struggling to pay salaries,\u201d recalled Sajwani. \u201cI went to the banks in 2008, November, and told all of them I\u2019m in a very bad shape.\u201d He said bankers restructured his debt while he negotiated with landowners and customers.\n\n\u201cThe guy has nine lives,\u201d said a Dubai-based international banker. \u201cHe\u2019s come close to imploding so many times.\u201d\n\nThe company promoted its buildings from China to India, in an attempt to woo new buyers to Dubai\u2019s volatile property market. But its reputation suffered from an association with poor-quality building work. \u201cWe had a challenge in 2011 and 2010,\u201d Sajwani said. \u201cWe launched some products [\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.] in a mediocre location. And we sold them very cheap.\u201d He insisted the quality matched the price but acknowledged buyers may have expected better.\n\n\u201cWere we perfect? No. There were buildings that, I agree, we could have done a much better job,\u201d Sajwani admitted. \u201cWe learned the lesson\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009If you look at our buildings, which have been delivered recently in the past few years, I don\u2019t think we had a quality issue.\u201d\n\nPrivately owned Damac\u2019s brash marketing techniques shook up a property market dominated by state-backed developers such as Nakheel and Emaar. As well as complimentary flights to Dubai for potential investors, Damac promised free luxury cars to apartment buyers.\n\nSuch promotions were criticised as \u201cunethical\u201d in 2014 by Mohamed Alabbar, chair of rival Emaar.\u00a0But Sajwani called the giveaways \u201cthe best and the greatest idea\u201d.\n\nDamac expanded beyond Dubai, with projects from Miami to the Maldives. However, Sajwani\u2019s overseas adventures initially proved difficult: a 2006 land purchase in Egypt ended in a legal battle with the state following the 2011 ousting of dictator Hosni Mubarak. Sajwani was sentenced to five years\u2019 jail time in absentia over corruption charges in 2011, although Egypt\u2019s prosecutor-general later suspended the sentence. Sajwani said the trial was politically motivated.\n\n\u201cAfter that, I stopped investing in countries where you\u2019re going to have challenges,\u201d Sajwani said.\n\nThe entrepreneur has not always endeared himself to outside investors. In 2022 he delisted Damac\u2019s shares from the Dubai stock exchange, retaking full control. Some investors complained they had funded the company through market doldrums and were being ousted as the share price was turning in their favour.\n\nSajwani denied he timed the deal to reap rewards and said market \u201cspeculators\u201d prompted the decision: \u201cWe didn\u2019t see being public is benefiting us. We were getting a lot of negativity from the speculators.\u201d\n\nUS data centres are his latest risky bet. Edgnex said it initially planned to form joint ventures with established players or potentially buy existing facilities and land prepared for development. Even so, analysts said reaching its goal of 2000MW of US capacity would be difficult in such a crowded market.\n\n\u201cOnce you have found the power, as a developer, especially as someone new to the space, the challenge is finding a spot in the queue to get all the equipment you need,\u201d said Pat Lynch, head of real estate adviser CBRE\u2019s Data Center Solutions team.\n\n\u201cOftentimes the biggest developers and the hyperscale [tech] companies have bought their ways into the queues several years out.\u201d\n\nOne industry executive said that even a $20bn investment was unlikely to make a mark: \u201cIn the context of data centres it is almost a yawn.\u201d\n\nDoubters are unlikely to bother Sajwani. Like his presidential business associate, Sajwani insists that his critics are uncomfortable with his role as a disrupter: \u201cPeople will tell you, \u2018Hussain Sajwani\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009He is a difficult man.\u2019 Which successful man is easy?\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/09d7eae3-9724-4eca-acc2-aa5dbb5627bd"}}, {"id": "42d78f8e-a157-49f7-a161-a4ce51a0680e", "event_name": "Italy\u2019s Azimut and China Universal team up on Abu Dhabi ETF link", "blurb": "Azimut will launch a fund in Abu Dhabi to invest in a China Universal ETF in Shanghai and vice versa", "date": "2024-12-1900:00:00.0", "body": "Italian asset manager Azimut Group and China Universal Asset Management are teaming up to launch an exchange traded fund that will be listed in Abu Dhabi as well as a second ETF in Shanghai to give Chinese and United Arab Emirates investors access to each other\u2019s equities markets.\n\nAzimut Group will launch an ETF on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange that will invest in China Universal AM\u2019s existing Shanghai-listed ETF tracking the CSI A500 index, Azimut confirmed.\n\nIn turn, China Universal AM will roll out an ETF to be listed on the Shanghai bourse that will feed into a separate Abu Dhabi-listed ETF that Azimut plans to launch.

In the same month, the average temperature in Marrakech, Morocco is 22C, while the average daily maximum temperature in Cairo, Egypt\u2019s capital, is 24.9C.\n\nDonat R\u00e9tif, chief executive of loveholidays, said warm weather in north Africa was driving business, with bookings at the UK\u2019s largest online travel agent for Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt up by 128 per cent, 36 per cent and 31 per cent respectively compared with 2023.\n\nAnother popular destination is the UAE: in October Virgin Atlantic increased flights from the UK to Dubai from three times a week to once a day, and loveholidays and On the Beach have reported higher demand.\n\nChinese online travel agent Trip.com said Christmas bookings by UK travellers to the UAE, whose capital is Abu Dhabi, had surged by 170 per cent compared with last year.\n\nAndy Washington, general manager for Europe, said the UAE had been boosted by being one of the first countries to open its borders after Covid and that milder temperatures in winter compared with summer was driving bookings.\n\nSome 2,105 flights were due to take off between Dubai and the UK between October and December, equating to more than 964,000 seats, the most ever offered in that quarter of the year, according to aviation data analyst Cirium.\n\nIssam Kazim, chief executive of the Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing, said Britons, who are the second-largest market after travellers from India, were attracted by the country\u2019s \u201csafety, security and infrastructure\u201d.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7155101f-b7a0-4aed-8b17-daa6572d0946"}}, {"id": "f038c721-802f-43fd-abcf-5f083bab50fb", "event_name": "Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala Capital takes large stake in US credit fund", "blurb": "Deal for $10bn Silver Rock Financial underscores Gulf nation\u2019s ambition to evolve beyond passive investing ", "date": "2024-12-0500:00:00.0", "body": "Mubadala Capital, the asset management arm of Abu Dhabi\u2019s state investment fund, is acquiring a large stake in a US-based credit manager as it seeks to build a global player in private capital based in the Middle East. The firm is buying a 42 per cent stake in Silver Rock Financial, a Los Angeles-based credit investment specialist backed by the family office of onetime \u201cjunk bond king\u201d Michael Milken and led by executives who used to manage the billionaire\u2019s sprawling portfolio of private investments.\u00a0Mubadala Capital will also take in an investment from Milken\u2019s family office, accepting outside equity for the first time. The deal underscores Abu Dhabi\u2019s growing ambition to not just passively invest its ample capital in ventures around the world but also to manage and guide decisions and deals for others. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mubadala Capital chief executive Hani Barhoush called the tie-up, which will be formally announced later on Thursday, a significant milestone.\n\n\u201cOur strategic objective since we were established was to build a significant Abu Dhabi-based third-party asset manager,\u201d said Barhoush. \u201cWe are pretty advanced, but there is still a long way to go and a lot of room to grow.\u201dSilver Rock, which manages about $10bn in assets with a speciality in structured products and high-yield debt investments, will push Mubadala Capital into the fast-growing arena of private credit investments.\n\nMubadala Capital manages about $27bn in assets, with about $18bn managed on behalf of third-party investors such as Milken\u2019s family office M-Cor and large institutions. It also manages about $9bn of cash coming from the balance sheet of its majority owner Mubadala Investment Company, the $302bn state investment fund.\u00a0Typically, local sovereign wealth funds and wealthy individuals in the region have invested in private markets through US- and Europe-based groups such as Apollo, Blackstone, CVC and KKR. However, Mubadala decided to create the independent Mubadala Capital unit in 2011 with the goal of it becoming large and skilled enough to attract outside investment dollars.\n\nUnder Barhoush and chief investment officer Oscar Fahlgren, Mubadala Capital has invested heavily in private equity and venture capital deals, backing companies such as high-end stroller maker Bugaboo and Arbol, a start-up focused on climate risk insurance. It also has invested heavily in Brazil and is providing structured equity financing to strong companies with overleveraged balance sheets.\n\nOver the past 18 months, Mubadala Capital has quickened its investment pace, emerging as a dealmaking force in the Middle East.\n\nIts funds acquired a majority stake in Fortress Investment Group for about $3bn in May and recently announced a C$12.1bn ($8.6bn) deal for CI Financial, a large asset manager.\n\nThe group\u2019s deal for Silver Rock, however, is its first strategic acquisition.\n\nMubadala Capital will pay with a mixture of cash and stock. Existing equity owners of Silver Rock, including chief executive Carl Meyer and Milken\u2019s family office, will take minority equity interests in Mubadala Capital at an undisclosed valuation. Separately, Mubadala Capital will also invest more than $1bn into Silver Rock\u2019s funds.\n\nMubadala and Silver Rock have worked on previous deals together, including a 2012 takeover of EMI Music Publishing, which they sold to Sony for $4.75bn in 2018.\n\nOther areas of strategic expansion could eventually include infrastructure or strategies dedicated to buying private equity fund stakes, said Fahlgren.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4e2018cf-2343-4036-8356-4730ad223aa1"}}, {"id": "c36e2201-6918-48cf-9cd6-f9aae3d7af74", "event_name": "Talabat raises $2bn in Dubai IPO as Gulf flotations shine", "blurb": "Food delivery group\u2019s listing comes as UAE is on track to beat rest of Emea region for IPO values", "date": "2024-11-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Middle East-based food delivery company Talabat has raised $2bn in the Gulf\u2019s biggest initial public offering this year, as the region bucks a global downturn in flotations.\n\nTalabat, which is German group Delivery Hero\u2019s food delivery and quick commerce business in the Middle East and north Africa, priced its IPO at Dh1.60 per share, it said on Friday. That gives it an implied market capitalisation of about Dh37.3bn ($10.1bn) \u2014 just below its Frankfurt-listed parent company, which is worth $11bn. It will list on the Dubai stock exchange.\n\nThe move helps keep the United Arab Emirates, which has exchanges in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi, on track to raise more money through IPOs than any other nation in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region for the third year running, according to Dealogic data.\n\nDemand for IPOs in the UAE has recently been boosted by \u201ca lot of investors moving here, which also created more awareness or comfort with the strength of the region\u201d, said Miguel Azevedo, Citigroup\u2019s investment banking vice-chair for the Middle East and Africa. \u201cPeople see the GDP growing on the streets.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIn 2022, 2023 and even a bit of 2024, international markets have not been very active. So it also makes the burst of activity here in the region more visible when you put it in an international context.\u201d\n\nRegional rival Riyadh\u2019s stock exchange typically has many more IPOs than the UAE \u2014 more than four times last year \u2014 but the size of IPOs in the UAE has been higher.\n\nTalabat\u2019s chief executive Tomaso Rodriguez said it made sense to list in Dubai because it is where the business is based and \u201cwe see a lot of interest from local and international investors in Dubai as a hub\u201d.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s surge in IPO activity in recent years marks a major turnaround for its capital markets. Having not made it into the top 10 Emea markets for value of IPOs for three straight years from 2018 to 2020, the UAE surged from ninth place in 2021 to first in 2022. It ranked fourth globally last year, behind China, the US and India, Dealogic data shows.\n\nThe surge has been jump-started by government efforts to sell shares in state-owned businesses. Oil-rich Abu Dhabi hoped flotations would improve governance levels and other business performance, while Dubai wanted to shake up its capital market, which it had struggled to revive after the 2008 financial crisis and where it was losing ground to Saudi Arabia and neighbouring Abu Dhabi.\n\nAbu Dhabi\u2019s state energy company floated its fuel distribution unit in 2017, raising about $850mn. Dubai\u2019s state utility company raised $6.1bn in 2022, and state parking group Parkin raised $429mn this March.\n\nThe move towards privatisation has spread to neighbouring Oman, which boasted the region\u2019s joint-largest IPO this year with a $2bn listing of a state-owned pipelines business. It raised fractionally less than Talabat.\n\nBut in the UAE, a growing share of listings are by private companies such as Talabat, buoyed by investors wanting access to growing Gulf markets.\n\nRegional supermarket chain Lulu Retail raised $1.7bn on the Abu Dhabi stock exchange this month and high-end grocer Spinneys raised $375mn in May through a Dubai listing.\n\nTalabat shares are expected to start trading on December 10 after the offering attracted \u201ca double-digit oversubscription level\u201d, according to the company. Their performance will be closely watched by investors, after the lacklustre debuts of Lulu Retail and Oman\u2019s OQ Exploration and Production.\n\nDelivery Hero earlier this week said it was increasing the size of the IPO to 20 per cent of Talabat, up from 15 per cent. It intends to retain a long-term majority indirect ownership position.\n\nThe IPO \u201cnot only demonstrates the region\u2019s buoyant market but also provides Delivery Hero with capital for growth while maintaining majority control\u201d, said Alex Frederick, senior emerging technology analyst at market data company PitchBook.\n\nIn third-quarter results earlier this month, the German group reported that the total value of goods sold by its Middle East and north Africa business had grown 30 per cent year on year to \u20ac3.2bn, above the overall group\u2019s 9 per cent growth.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/75dbb660-473b-4a87-96b0-1055ce314068"}}, {"id": "eb07d689-3f62-4a63-a66c-ed267f5aea93", "event_name": "Mubadala Capital agrees C$12.1bn deal for Canadian asset manager CI Financial", "blurb": "Asset management subsidiary of Abu Dhabi\u2019s state investment fund seeks more exposure in North America", "date": "2024-11-2500:00:00.0", "body": "An arm of Abu Dhabi\u2019s state investment fund is buying Canadian asset manager CI Financial in one of the largest direct investments into North America by energy-rich Middle Eastern buyers as they increase their investment plans in the region.\n\nMubadala Capital, the asset management subsidiary of the $302bn-in-assets state-backed investment fund, has agreed to pay C$32 a share for CI Financial, representing a 33 per cent premium to its Friday closing price.\n\nThe deal ascribes the Toronto-based investment manager, which has more than C$500bn in assets and a long history of managing money for wealthy US and Canadian investors, an equity value of C$4.7bn ($3.36bn), or an enterprise value of C$12.1bn when including its debt.\n\nThe takeover marks Mubadala Capital\u2019s largest acquisition and comes as its chief executive Hani Barhoush told the Financial Times last month that he was preparing a deal push in North America, spotting an opportunity to plough cash into complex management buyouts, or to build stakes in private equity-owned businesses.\n\nMubadala, which recently raised a $3.1bn private equity fund, will rely on a large equity investment by its parent company to finance a takeover commitment that is larger than its entire fund. The structure is similar to Mubadala\u2019s $3bn acquisition of credit manager Fortress Investment Group from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, which was completed earlier this year and also relied on billions in support from its parent company.\n\nIn both deals, Mubadala is investing alongside existing management, who will be retained through the takeover and roll over large equity interests.\n\nCI Financial\u2019s management owns almost 16.9 per cent of the company. Chief executive Kurt MacAlpine will roll all of his shares while chair William Holland will roll up to 25 per cent of his stake.\n\nMubadala has also agreed to keep the CI Financial\u2019s data in Canada. Mubadala made a similar concession as part of its takeover of Fortress, agreeing to keep its technology and data domiciled in the US to appease regulators such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States as it scrutinised the deal.\n\nCI Financial, which owns large wealth management operations in the US, has seen its share price stagnate in recent years as it accumulated heavy debts during an acquisition binge. Last year, it took a $1bn investment into its US wealth unit, called Corient, and said it would consider spinning off the operation. However, Mubadala plans to keep CI Financial\u2019s operations together under private ownership, according to people familiar with its plans.\n\nMubadala\u2019s acquisition comes as the Middle East-based fund has increased its pace of investments. In addition to Fortress, it has acquired high-end baby stroller brand Bugaboo, and Spanish IT consultancy Babel, over the past year. Barhoush told the FT last month that Mubadala Capital was also looking to buy large direct stakes in private equity-owned businesses where sellers were seeking liquidity.\n\n\u201cWe are fully aligned with the strategy and direction of the firm and look forward to working with the CI management team to continue to build this outstanding business,\u201d Barhoush said in a press release.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/278df4b9-767e-41fa-aeee-c51a7c8d3eaa"}}, {"id": "56d18c4c-4b99-4ce8-aba8-fca77e08bae7", "event_name": "Missing Israeli rabbi found dead in UAE", "blurb": "Three suspects arrested after Emirati intelligence and security services locate body", "date": "2024-11-2400:00:00.0", "body": "An Israeli-Moldovan man who had been missing in the United Arab Emirates has been found dead, Israeli authorities announced on Sunday, calling his killing \u201can abhorrent act of antisemitic terrorism\u201d.\n\nEmirati intelligence and security services located the body of Zvi Kogan, an emissary for the Jewish Chabad religious group, three days after he vanished after leaving the store where he worked.\n\nThe UAE interior ministry said on Sunday evening that three suspects had been arrested, without giving details of their identity.

The Gulf state, which is the region\u2019s trade, tourism and finance hub, was the first of three Arab countries that normalised relations with Israel in a landmark deal in 2020, known as the Abraham Accords.\n\nAfter the deal, the UAE welcomed Israeli tourists and business people, particularly technology entrepreneurs as it sought to build economic ties, with a focus on tapping Israeli technology.\n\nThe small, autocratic state, which has a highly sophisticated security apparatus, was considered one of the safest countries in the region for Israelis to travel to.\n\nThe killing comes at a turbulent time in the Middle East, which is in the grip of a spiralling conflict that began with Hamas\u2019s October 7 2023 attack on Israel. It has since escalated across the region, with Israeli forces launching a ground invasion of Lebanon, exchanging missile salvos with Iran, and trading fire with Iranian proxies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.\n\nThe UAE has remained committed to the Abraham Accords, while joining other Arab states in condemning the devastation caused by Israel\u2019s more than year-long assault against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIn a separate incident on Sunday, Jordanian state media said a suspected gunman was shot dead and three policemen injured after a shootout near the Israeli embassy in the Jordanian capital Amman.\n\nIsraeli officials gave no information about whom they believed was behind the killing of Kogan or their motive. Israeli media reported that Emirati officials suspected that a cell linked to Iran was behind the killing.\n\nIn 2020, Iranian operatives abducted a German-Iranian national from Dubai, before spiriting him back to Iran, where he was executed last month.\n\nMembers of the Israeli community in the UAE said Kogan was well known locally for running a kosher supermarket.

This became more urgent after Hamas\u2019s October 7 2023 attack against Israel triggered a wave of regional hostilities and heightened tensions between the US and Iran, with both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi seeking to remain on the sidelines.\n\nGulf leaders, who traditionally prefer a Republican presidency, have welcomed Trump\u2019s re-election and hope the self-styled dealmaker fulfils his campaign pledge to bring peace to the region. But diplomats and people close to regional governments say they are also wary he could give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu more licence to escalate against Israel\u2019s foes and to raise tensions with Iran, risking an all-out conflict that could spill over into the Gulf states.\n\n\u201cIf Trump puts you in a situation where you have to decide [which side to take], because he\u2019s going against Iran, it\u2019s a big problem,\u201d a senior Arab diplomat said. \u201cTrump is not the kind of guy who takes \u2018no\u2019 for an answer.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of Riyadh\u2019s desire to maintain its cold peace with Iran, Prince Mohammed on Monday hosted senior Iranian officials at an Arab-Muslim conference in Jeddah in which he accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. He also condemned Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran, calling on the international community to stop hostile actions on Iranian territory.\n\nSeparately, Anwar Gargash, the UAE\u2019s presidential adviser, told a conference in Abu Dhabi on Monday that the incoming Trump administration must pursue a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d approach instead of \u201creactive and piecemeal\u201d policies.\n\nThe comments underlined the shift in Saudi and Emirati thinking since they actively courted Trump after he took office in 2017 following years of Arab frustration with US policy swings and a sense of disengagement from the region.\n\nBoth Riyadh and Abu Dhabi cheered the Trump administration\u2019s hawkish stance on Iran, his decision to abandon the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers and to impose crippling sanctions on the republic.\n\nBut as Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign sent tension soaring across the region, they became aware of their own vulnerability to Iranian hostility.\n\nGulf rulers\u2019 faith in the US\u2019s willingness to defend them was particularly shaken after a missile and drone attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure in 2019 temporarily knocked out half of the kingdom\u2019s crude production. While Washington blamed Iran, Trump chose not to respond beyond imposing more sanctions.\n\nGiorgio Cafiero, chief executive of Washington-based Gulf State Analytics, said that by the time Trump\u2019s first term ended, regional leaders \u201crealised that in practice [it] had not succeeded in making the Gulf Arab monarchies more secure\u201d.\n\nWith confidence in the US security umbrella undermined, Saudi and the UAE decided de-escalation with Iran was the best bet to protect their states and allow them to focus on economic diversification.\n\nThis culminated in a China-brokered agreement in March 2023 that re-established diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran after a seven-year rift. Gulf leaders\u2019 concern now is that an even broader conflagration in the Middle East could undermine their domestic development plans.\n\n\u201cThe deal supported by China is for the good of the region,\u201d said a person familiar with the Saudi government\u2019s thinking. \u201cSaudi Arabia will remain committed to it as long as [Iran is] committed.\u201d\n\nThe kingdom \u201cbelieves the focus should be on economic development and the success of its vision, which ultimately will offer the region a vision for a way forward beyond conflict, a vision that should benefit everybody.\u201d\n\nFayyad al-Ruwaili, chief of staff of the Saudi armed forces, was on Sunday with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Bagheri in Tehran to discuss defence co-operation as part of the Beijing agreement, the kingdom\u2019s Ministry of Defense said.\n\nBut while vowing to bring peace to the Middle East, Trump has also expressed support for Israel\u2019s military offensives and appears set to appoint Iran hawks to his administration.\n\nElise Stefanik, Trump\u2019s pick for US ambassador to the UN, wrote on X that \u201cthe US is ready for a return to President Trump\u2019s MAXIMUM PRESSURE campaign against Iran\u201d.\n\nGulf leaders fear the president-elect, who implemented a string of pro-Israeli policies in his first term, could embolden Netanyahu rather than rein him in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll stand on the sideline, we are protected,\u201d the diplomat said, but added: \u201cAny defence system can be exhausted. It\u2019s not a joke.\u201d\n\nStill, both Prince Mohammed and Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE\u2019s president, will look forward to having closer personal relationships with Trump than they had with President Joe Biden.\n\nThe relationship with Trump and his entourage continued after he left the White House, with his son-in-law Jared Kushner and former Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin receiving billions of dollars from Gulf sovereign wealth funds for investment firms run by the two former officials.\n\nBiden was initially critical of Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed after he entered office, vowing to reassess Washington\u2019s relations with the kingdom after the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi. But ties improved as Biden pushed for a three-way deal that would have led to the US agreeing to a defence treaty with Saudi Arabia in return for the kingdom normalising relations with Israel.\n\nThose plans were upended by the war in Gaza. Trump, who counted the 2020 Abraham Accords normalisation between Israel, the UAE and three other Arab states as one of his biggest foreign policy successes, may seek his own grand bargain.\n\nBut that would require both ending Israel\u2019s wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hizbollah in Lebanon and getting it to make concessions towards the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\n\u201cThe sense we get [is that] President Trump wants a deal to end the war in Gaza\u201d, another Arab diplomat said. \u201cWill it be what everyone wants? Maybe not.

Adia\u2019s investment will be announced later on Monday.\n\nThoma Bravo, a specialist software buyout group, acquired Qlik in 2016 for about $3bn. The fund that bought Qlik will now sell its stake to Adia, a group of other large pensions and sovereign wealth funds, and two newer Thoma Bravo funds for a gain of about three times its investment, the sources said.\n\nThe deal adds to a string of large financings done by Adia and many other Middle Eastern funds in recent years as private equity investors have slowed the pace of deals because of higher interest rates, and struggled to exit older investments. Funds such as Adia have become important sources of equity financing for new takeovers and acquired stakes in companies such as Qlik, where private equity firms are seeking liquidity for their investors.\n\nAdia recently backed Advent International\u2019s purchase of a stake in US wealth manager Fisher Investments, Blackstone\u2019s $14bn acquisition of a climate technology business from engineering group Emerson, and KKR\u2019s \u20ac22bn acquisition of Telecom Italia\u2019s fixed-line phone and internet network.\n\nAdia has also bought into businesses moving between private equity firms\u2019 funds. In 2022, it bought a large stake in business services company TMF Group as its private equity owner CVC Capital Partners sold the company from one fund to another.

Its sales are on track to reach $1.5bn this year and bookings for its software subscriptions are up 30 per cent from the prior year, sources said. In 2022, Thoma Bravo merged Qlik, which is used by companies ranging from Domino\u2019s Pizza to Airbus to analyse performance data, with Talend, a rival software company it acquired in 2021 for $2.4bn.\n\nInvestors in the 2021-era Thoma Bravo fund that acquired Talend will make an additional equity investment in Qlik. The group\u2019s 2022-era fund will make a large investment, said the sources.

It became a prime example of the deal bubble in 2021 after it invested almost all of a $22.8bn fund in a year when tech valuations hit stratospheric levels, only to then plunge when interest rates soared.\n\nSince 2022, the group has focused on returning cash to its investors and sold down $20bn in investments since September 2023, realising large gains that have appeased many investors.\n\nIt sold financial software business Adenza to Nasdaq for $10.5bn, generating billions in gains for its 2021 fund, and closed a handful of other large investments this year.

There\u2019s a balance between Israel degrading Hizbollah and Iran, and things getting out of control,\u201d Shihabi said.\n\nBoth Iran and Gulf states are keen to keep diplomatic channels open as the regional crisis intensifies. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman this week held talks with Iran\u2019s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, who made a rare trip to Riyadh to discuss the \u201clatest regional developments\u201d, the Saudi state news agency said.\n\nAraghchi then flew to Qatar, which has good relations with Tehran, while also hosting the US\u2019s biggest military base in the Middle East.\n\nLast week the Iranian diplomat held talks with Gulf foreign ministers on the sidelines of a meeting of the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council in Doha \u2014 the first time in years that such talks had taken place at a GCC gathering. Two Arab officials described the meeting as \u201cconciliatory\u201d and \u201cco-operative\u201d.\n\nThe Iranian official said Tehran had not threatened Gulf states. But he said the message was twofold: \u201cpersuading them to help them bring a ceasefire in the region, and warning them that if Israel attacks Iran they should not in any way facilitate that attack\u201d.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE have for several years sought to calm their long-running acrimony with Iran. But they still view the Islamic regime as a malign actor in the region and are wary of the threat it poses.\n\nIn 2019 \u2014 as the Gulf powerhouses backed former US president Donald Trump\u2019s maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic republic \u2014 Iran was blamed for a missile and drone assault that temporarily knocked out half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil output, as well as the sabotage attacks on two tankers in the Gulf.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia restored diplomatic relations in March 2023, establishing a cold peace between the two adversaries. It has also been seeking to extract itself from its conflict with the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, a major point of friction.\n\nBoth Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have sought to remain on the sidelines of the wave of regional hostilities that erupted after Hamas\u2019s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. They have pressed for a ceasefire, while joining other Muslim states in condemning Israel\u2019s conduct of its war.\n\nSince the Hamas attack triggered war with Israel, the UAE has cautioned Washington that it did not want any US assets in the Gulf state to be used against Iranian targets.\n\nThat reflected concern in Abu Dhabi about the degree to which the US would commit to defend the UAE from any subsequent counterstrike from Iran or the Houthis.\n\nFor similar reasons, neither the UAE nor Saudi Arabia joined a US-led maritime task force that has attempted to counter Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.\n\n\u201cAs long as the Americans are hedging on their security commitments to the region, the region will have to hedge to protect itself,\u201d said a person familiar with the UAE\u2019s thinking.\n\nRiyadh did, however, provide assistance to the US as American forces and their allies intercepted missiles that Iran fired at Israel in April, western diplomats said. It is not clear what that entailed.\n\n\u201cThey are caught between the two regional bullies, Israel and Iran, with neither appealing to their visions of the region,\u201d said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House.\n\nIsrael\u2019s relentless pounding of Hizbollah \u2014 Iran\u2019s most powerful proxy \u2014 has exemplified the bind in which the two states find themselves, she added.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE have long considered Hizbollah a \u201cterrorist\u201d organisation. They see it as a destabilising force, not just in Lebanon but across the region, and it serves their interests to see the group weakened.\n\nThey accuse the militant movement of training and supporting the Houthis \u2014 who in the past have fired missiles and drones at Saudi Arabia and the UAE \u2014 and stoking instability among Shia populations in their countries.\n\nThe Gulf states and Hizbollah were also on opposing sides in Syria\u2019s civil war, with the former backing Sunni rebels and the latter fighting alongside Iranian and Russian forces in support of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime.\n\nIn 2017, Riyadh warned it would treat Lebanon \u2014 which historically received billions of dollars in Gulf aid \u2014 as a hostile state as long as Hizbollah remained in its government.\n\nThe Saudis and Emiratis have for years fretted about the Shia group\u2019s dominance over Lebanese politics at the expense of the Sunni parties they traditionally backed, reducing Riyadh\u2019s political influence in Beirut.\n\nBut the concern in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi is the destabilising impact of Israel\u2019s expanding offensive.\n\n\u201cThere is no love lost between Hizbollah and Saudi, but Lebanon is a sovereign state and this is a very dangerous precedent that the Israelis are setting.

Desmond has been equally frustrated with the state of the Conservative government in power when he started to consider the move, the person noted however.\n\nHe has \u201clost confidence in British politics\u201d, said the person. \u201cHe likes being in the UK and will spend a lot of his time here but is an entrepreneur at heart \u2014 and he sees the opportunities now over in Dubai.\u201d\n\nA growing numbers of wealthy UK individuals are examining whether to move abroad for various reasons, including taxation under the newly elected Labour government. Entrepreneurs and private equity financiers are notably concerned about the prospect of higher taxes on capital gains.\n\nThe abolition of the generous UK \u201cnon-dom\u201d regime that allowed expatriates to avoid paying tax on overseas income has also prompted wealthy foreigners to relocate to tax-friendlier jurisdictions. Countries including the UAE, Italy and Switzerland are jostling to attract mobile high-net-worth individuals and their families, including through tax breaks.\n\nOnce the biggest donor to Nigel Farage\u2019s UK Independence party ahead of the Brexit referendum, Desmond has also donated to the Labour party in the past, and allowed his newspapers to switch between Labour and the Conservatives \u2014 often whichever was in power.\n\nDubai has enjoyed strong momentum after being one of the earlier cities to reopen its economy following a tough lockdown in the Covid-19 pandemic, pitching itself as a safe place to holiday and work for foreigners. Investing the equivalent of $500,000, being an entrepreneur or just having a special skillset is usually enough to secure UAE residency.\n\nDesmond\u2019s company, Northern & Shell, lost out in 2022 on the licence to run the national lottery to the Czech-owned Allwyn, which has led to ongoing legal action by the media mogul against the decision-making process.\n\nNorthern & Shell is also the owner of the Health Lottery, which since its launch in 2011 has raised more than \u00a3130mn for 3,400 local health projects across the UK.\n\nDesmond has also spent many years trying to redevelop the Westferry Printworks site on the Thames. This summer, after eight years and three attempts, Northern & Shell secured planning approval by Tower Hamlets Council for a \u00a31bn residential development in east London.\n\nAdditional reporting by Chloe Cornish in Dubai", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4b2e9b27-2346-4c39-b9ac-ca0c88d8147e"}}, {"id": "7d7ddd57-6442-4e80-b16f-6a2218dd1fd5", "event_name": "Nuveen joins rush of asset managers to open Abu Dhabi office", "blurb": "Move by US-based investment manager comes as oil-rich emirate woos financial services firms", "date": "2024-09-2600:00:00.0", "body": "Nuveen is set to open its first Middle East office in Abu Dhabi, making it the second investor with over $1tn in assets to announce a bet on the fledgling financial hub this month.\n\nThe oil-rich emirate, which is home to sovereign wealth funds worth at least $1.5tn, is wagering that attracting financial services firms to the city will further diversify its economy and wean it off fossil fuel revenues.\n\nNuveen, the wholly-owned subsidiary of US teachers pension fund TIAA with $1.2tn in assets under management, will initially open a three-person office to deal with its institutional clients in the region.

Talks for a formal security pact with Washington have stalled, and Abu Dhabi was infuriated by what it saw as a lukewarm US response to attacks on the UAE\u2019s capital by Houthi rebels from Yemen in 2022.\n\nYet AI has brought new energy to the relationship.

This means companies have to apply for licences to export the chips, and the process has held up some UAE companies\u2019 AI plans.\n\nThe presidents instructed officials to develop a memorandum of understanding on AI co-operation, the next step in formalising the partnership. But they also sketched out several broad areas for collaboration, including supporting bilateral investment and \u201cefficient licensing\u201d.\n\nOne person briefed on the UAE\u2019s plans said the Gulf state had wanted to sketch out a \u201croad map\u201d ahead of the upcoming US election \u201cso that progress is locked in\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009whatever president assumes office in January\u201d.\n\nThe person added officials were aiming to get the UAE\u2019s export designation changed so it would be easier to get hold of chips.\n\nBrad Smith, president of Microsoft, which invested $1.5bn in the UAE\u2019s most important AI group G42 in April, told the Financial Times last week that clarity over the export controls was \u201cemerging\u201d, but it had \u201ctaken several months to work through\u201d.\n\nSmith added that export applications by Microsoft and other technology companies were not fully complete but were \u201cgetting very close\u201d.\n\nIn a sign of the UAE\u2019s drive to deepen relationships with US companies, G42 announced last week that it was working with Nvidia, the US company that makes chips critical for AI, on a weather forecasting initiative.\n\nUS companies looking to finance expensive AI projects have also welcomed Abu Dhabi\u2019s petrodollars.\n\nMGX, a new Abu Dhabi investment vehicle dedicated to AI, last week announced it was joining asset manager BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Microsoft to launch a $30bn fund to invest in data centres and the energy to power them.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE\u2019s national security adviser and chair of G42, visited Washington in June and has spearheaded the UAE\u2019s efforts to secure US backing for its AI ambitions.\n\nThe FT previously reported that OpenAI founder Sam Altman and Sheikh Tahnoon were in discussions to finance an ambitious chipmaking project.\n\nGargash said Sheikh Tahnoon had \u201ca good understanding of tech\u201d, suggesting this could help the UAE\u2019s negotiations with US officials and executives. \u201cWhen he sits with somebody like Altman or whatever, he\u2019s really talking his language,\u201d Gargash said.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon attended the meeting between Biden and Sheikh Mohamed.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e85bef92-5f53-4f71-bb3b-a0d65f3a4c48"}}, {"id": "4aed801c-d958-48ce-b9e7-84b1e30e678f", "event_name": "The UAE\u2019s growth plan to boost ranks of Emiratis", "blurb": "Trend for smaller families prompts concern among locals who are outnumbered 9 to 1 by migrant population", "date": "2024-09-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Emirati student Shaima lives in Abu Dhabi with her four siblings and parents. But she says her seven-person household is small \u2014 her father grew up alongside 11 brothers and sisters in the days when the region\u2019s families were legendarily large.\n\nThe generational downsizing in the 21-year-old\u2019s family reflects a dramatic social shift across the United Arab Emirates: Emirati women bear about half the number of children their grandmothers did in 1970, with the fertility rate down from 6.7 per woman in 1970 to 3.7 by 2017, according to official data.\n\nIn a country that lures millions of migrant workers to power an economy that has grown at breakneck speed since the 1960s, the trend has prompted many Emiratis to worry that they belong to a dwindling minority in their own country \u2014 and spurred authorities to offer more support designed to encourage large families.\n\n\u201cUs Emiratis are a minority in our own country,\u201d said Shaima, who called the trend \u201cupsetting\u201d. Expatriates form 93.5 per cent of the UAE population of about 9.5mn, according to the UN.\n\n\u201cWhy is demographics a sensitive issue?\u201d said William Gu\u00e9raiche, associate professor at the University of Wollongong in Dubai. \u201cBecause this imbalance will grow between the Emiratis and foreigners, and Emiratis feel more and more under siege, rightly or not. But this is the general perception, and the authorities have to deal with that.\u201d\n\nThe Emirati fertility rate, which government figures put at 3.2 in 2021, has halved in the past two decades, according to Luca Maria Pesando, associate professor of social research and public policy at NYU Abu Dhabi. He described the drop as \u201cvery fast for a demographic transition\u201d.\n\nAlthough 3.2 exceeds the so-called replacement rate of 2.1 live births per woman, meaning the number of Emiratis is not falling, the authorities are concerned about the speed of the decline, said Pesando, who is working on plans to open a state-funded demographics research centre at NYU Abu Dhabi. \u201cIf this has halved [in 20 years], maybe it can halve again,\u201d he added.\n\nOne former Emirati official said it was almost inevitable the Emirati minority would dwindle as a proportion of the resident population.\n\n\u201cIf we are successful in\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. attracting more people into the country, this automatically diminishes us as a percentage,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you counter that? Encourage people to have more kids.\u201d\n\nThe government has traditionally offered generous subsidies to local families, from grants and loans for housing and weddings to marriage counselling and help with childcare.\n\nBut a new \u201cEmirati Family Growth Support Programme\u201d in Abu Dhabi, the emirate which includes the UAE\u2019s capital city, focuses on family size, with incentives such as reduced loan debt on the birth of a fourth, fifth and sixth child.\n\nThe government wants Emirati families to \u201cgrow their numbers because they play a vital role in achieving social stability and preserving national identity\u201d, said Hamad Ali Al Dhaheri, under-secretary of Abu Dhabi\u2019s community development department.\n\nThe UAE does not publish detailed national statistics on population composition. But data from Dubai, the region\u2019s business and tourism hub, shows expat population growth still outpacing that of locals. While the number of Emiratis in Dubai increased 31 per cent between 2015 and 2023, the number of foreigners rose by 46 per cent.\n\nExpatriates are largely transient and have scant chance of becoming Emirati citizens, but the UAE has in recent years offered longer-term visas and encouraged foreigners to buy property and invest in businesses.\n\nThe Emirates are expecting a further influx of overseas workers as they pursue ambitious plans for the economy, with Dubai alone forecasting a population of 5.8mn people by 2040, from around 3.5mn now.\n\nThe millions of migrant workers, from domestic help to oil engineers and finance professionals, have helped drive rapid growth since Abu Dhabi started exporting oil in the 1960s and Dubai established itself as a trading hub. In just a few decades the country has moved from a largely impoverished tribal society to enjoying some of the region\u2019s highest living standards.\n\nBy 2023 the UAE recorded the Middle East\u2019s second biggest gross domestic product per capita, according to the World Bank.\n\nBut the country\u2019s economic success is a leading factor behind its own slowing birth rate, according to observers. Some Emiratis say rising living costs discourage them from having more children.\u00a0A government worker and mother of one said she was not planning to have more because of the expense of childcare, including education costs.\n\nAcademics also argue that smaller families are partly driven by the UAE\u2019s success in encouraging women to pursue higher education and employment and contribute to the economy, which has led many to delay marriage and having children.\n\nThe UAE has a high proportion of working women compared with the wider region, with 55 per cent of those aged over 15 participating in the labour force. By contrast the average across the Middle East and North Africa is 19 per cent, according to International Labour Organization estimates.\n\nFor 30-year-old Huda, a museum researcher whose mother married at 16 and had nine children, staying at home to raise a family was the last thing she wanted.\n\n\u201c[My generation] were very open to [what we saw in] American and western movies,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted independence.\u201d\n\nOther UAE policies to help working mothers, such as lengthening statutory maternity leave to 60 days, may not be enough to bring back the big families of the past.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m going to be a working mum,\u201d said Shaima, who said she would like four children. \u201cI need to balance between my working life and taking care of my kids.

No, this group is very real. The alliance is planning a $100bn spending spree that is to \u201cenhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth\u201d.\n\nThe trio is comprised of BlackRock, Microsoft and MGX, the latter an investment vehicle of Abu Dhabi. The group says it can collectively stump up $30bn of equity capital, which will be leveraged three times to hit total purchasing power, to build out the vast power infrastructure that artificial intelligence will supposedly require. It is one of several private capital attempts to get in on the gold rush.\n\nThe mining is proving to be very expensive, whether for semiconductors, computing power or energy. The result is an arms race between already ultra-dominant players in the economy, who could further entrench their power by controlling the next great technological innovation. Society and regulators should consider if that heralds a happy ending, or a dubious plot development.\n\nThe massive pools of capital that have accumulated around the world have increasingly looked to steadier, long-term investment horizons provided by infrastructure, private credit and a combination of the two. Even before the AI mania of the past two years, electrification, power transmission and distribution, as well as the clean energy transition, were prime targets for asset managers. BlackRock purchased Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5bn precisely to get in on this mega trend.\n\nElectricity demand had been largely flat in the US for several years after the financial crisis. But that is fast changing: the US Energy Department expects a sharp 2.4 per cent compound annual growth rate spike between now and 2030. In particular, the power needs in Texas and Virginia are acute given their heavy concentration of data centres.\n\nWhat was an arms race between the likes of BlackRock, Blackstone, and Brookfield now seems to require latching on to a Big Tech behemoth and perhaps a sovereign wealth fund for good measure. Microsoft argues that AI infrastructure requires efforts that go beyond any single country or company. Maybe we need a superhero antitrust lawyer to scrutinise that proposition before it is too late.\n\nsujeet.indap@ft.com", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6ea5754b-86b7-4cd9-bfd6-96f8e639e281"}}, {"id": "f5c8dd4e-671b-4f18-be25-b7dcf80ba40e", "event_name": "PGIM becomes latest US asset manager to open Abu Dhabi office", "blurb": "Oil-rich emirate draws new name as it seeks to become financial hub to rival neighbouring Dubai", "date": "2024-09-1200:00:00.0", "body": "The $1.3tn asset manager PGIM has become one of the biggest players in its industry to open an office in Abu Dhabi, as the oil-rich emirate seeks to build itself up as a financial hub to rival neighbouring Dubai.\n\nThe arm of New York-listed insurer Prudential Financial announced on Thursday that it was opening an office in the Abu Dhabi Global Market centre, its first in the Middle East.\n\nA number of hedge funds and billionaire family offices have set up in the city, which is home to sovereign wealth funds including the nearly $1tn Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.\n\nAbu Dhabi Global Market\u2019s head of market development Arvind Ramamurthy said PGIM\u2019s arrival would \u201cstrengthen ADGM\u2019s position\u201d.\n\nPGIM\u2019s new Middle East head Mohammed Abdulmalek said the move \u201cemphasises our ongoing dedication to our presence in the UAE and our commitment to the Middle East\u201d, and he described Abu Dhabi as a key market for PGIM.\u00a0The asset manager said it had secured a licence to operate in ADGM.\n\n\u201cMiddle Eastern sovereign wealth\u00a0funds along with other institutional clients and evolving family offices are looking for partners who can support them as they strive to deepen the local capital markets and become more than providers of capital to the rest of the world,\u201d said David Hunt, PGIM\u2019s CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be close to our partners to work most effectively with them as they achieve these goals.\u201d\n\nFor years, global money managers served Gulf clients from offices in Europe, North America or the regional financial hub of Dubai.\n\nAbu Dhabi wants to attract some of that business as it tries to diversify its economy and lessen its dependence on oil.

Some have gone to investors from Iran, Turkey and China, which also pledged to include Afghanistan in its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\n\nAn Abu Dhabi company won contracts to manage Afghan airports in 2022, beating a Qatari-Turkish consortium, and there are now regular flights between Kabul and the UAE. \u201cI hear regional officials say things like, \u2018The world is changing, the Americans aren\u2019t the boss of everything any more,\u2019\u201d said Graeme Smith, a senior consultant at Crisis Group. \u201cAfghanistan is emblematic of that for these middle powers.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban have sought to dispel international misgivings about their rule, saying they are open to engagement and investment. \u201cOur policy is to have good relations with all,\u201d Suhail Shaheen, the head of the Taliban\u2019s political office in Qatar, told the Financial Times.\n\nShortly after taking power, the Taliban vowed to break with the practices that made their first rule in the 1990s notorious, including a ban on girls\u2019 education and hosting extremists such as al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, whose role in plotting the September 11 attacks from the country prompted the Nato invasion in 2001.\n\nBut the Taliban have again barred girls from school, and bin Laden\u2019s successor Ayman al-Zawahiri lived in central Kabul until his death in a US drone strike in 2022. The Taliban last month ratified a law that banned women from showing their faces and speaking in public.\n\nFor most North American and European governments, this has largely scuppered hopes of meaningful engagement. Germany, which has no diplomatic relations with the Taliban, last week deported 28 convicted Afghan criminals back to the country for the first time.\n\nSome in the region argue that isolation and sanctions are exacerbating a humanitarian crisis that only worsens the plight of Afghanistan\u2019s women and gives the Taliban little incentive to change.\n\n\u201cThe American approach to Afghanistan is, \u2018Keep it out of the news, it has been a 20-year embarrassment\u2019\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009in the UK, the discussion is similar,\u201d one diplomat said. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to sit back and condemn them for being misogynist.\u201d\n\nThat is harder for countries in the region, which are more vulnerable to violence spilling over their borders. The UN has estimated that hundreds of al-Qaeda members are in Afghanistan alongside other militants such as the Uyghur Turkistan Islamic party and Isis-K, the Afghanistan-based offshoot of the Middle Eastern terror group.\n\nFor the UAE, security \u201cprompts them to view engagement with the Taliban as necessary\u201d, said Giorgio Cafiero, chief executive of Washington-based risk consultancy Gulf State Analytics. \u201c[This] is simply about Abu Dhabi being pragmatic and making the most of the situation in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nYet some analysts warned that trusting the Taliban could prove a costly mistake.\n\nPakistan was one of the earliest advocates for global engagement with Taliban-run Kabul but suffered a dramatic surge in militant violence by groups including the Taliban\u2019s Pakistani offshoot, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s unwillingness \u2014 or inability \u2014 to stop them led to a sharp deterioration in relations, with Pakistan even launching air strikes on TTP targets in Afghanistan.\n\nThe diplomat said the limited foreign presence inside Afghanistan meant many countries were still struggling to ascertain the extent of the threat posed by Taliban rule, but the risks remained high. \u201cObviously the lesson from history is 9/11.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b57c4a20-53fc-4978-ad76-4b7c219b3ffb"}}, {"id": "b9e6440b-85d4-4e21-be9d-c3ffffc2dccc", "event_name": "Dubai\u2019s \u2018co-pilot\u2019 princes step up as emirate prepares for next generation ", "blurb": "Sheikhs Hamdan and Maktoum take on greater responsibility as their father Sheikh Mohammed gradually steps back", "date": "2024-09-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Dubai crown prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed al-Maktoum has won popularity at home for his thrill-seeking pursuits, from leading mass-participation runs and cycle events to scaling the city\u2019s Burj Khalifa tower.\n\nHis younger brother Sheikh Maktoum keeps a lower profile, preferring to eschew the limelight as he cultivates the image of an astute technocrat.\n\nDubai\u2019s ruling family is counting on the brothers\u2019 different qualities to maintain the development of an emirate that has evolved over the decades from an entrep\u00f4t port to a global trade, tourism and financial centre.\n\nTheir abilities are moving more into focus as their father, Dubai ruler and United Arab Emirates prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, gradually steps back from frontline decision-making. The 75-year-old is now regularly photographed walking with a cane, as the ground is prepared for the eventual succession of Hamdan.\n\n\u201cSheikh Mohammed\u2019s still in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a Dubai-based political scientist. \u201cBut the co-pilots have taken more responsibility.\u201d\n\nHamdan, 41, and Maktoum, 40, were in their 20s when they were appointed heir apparent and deputy ruler respectively, with a view to eventually\u00a0taking over the day-to-day running of Dubai from their father.\n\n\u201cHamdan is seen as the chief marketing officer [in charge of] new investments, tourism and promoting Dubai,\u201d said one emirate-based chief executive. \u201cMaktoum is the money man, he\u2019s more serious.\u201d\n\nThe succession planning moved up a gear in July as Hamdan joined the federal government as deputy prime minister. He also stepped into the largely ceremonial role of defence minister held by his father since 1971. Maktoum has been UAE finance minister and a deputy prime minister since 2021.\n\nThe brothers\u2019 partnership is part of a new generation of leaders emerging in the Gulf. After Abu Dhabi\u2019s Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan became UAE president last year he appointed his eldest son Sheikh Khaled as crown prince and promoted his own brothers.\n\nManaging the power balance between Abu Dhabi, the cash-rich Emirati capital, and the more entrepreneurial Dubai is a task that will increasingly rest on the shoulders of the younger cohort.\n\nDubai\u2019s latest revival started amid the coronavirus pandemic after it reopened its tourism and services-based economy faster than other cities.\n\nThe highest profile of the seven emirates that make up the UAE, the city became a magnet for wealthy tech and crypto investors, social media influencers and remote workers fleeing lockdowns elsewhere. Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 sparked a further influx of Russians relocated by multinational companies, seeking to avoid the impact of western sanctions, or avoid the draft.\n\nDubai\u2019s total population grew 9 per cent between 2019 and 2023, according to government estimates, hitting 3.7mn. The expanding ranks of expatriates helped generated Dubai\u2019s third property surge this century, following the growth of the early 2000s.\n\nThat earlier boom ended nine years later amid the global financial crisis, when Dubai used more than $20bn in bailout loans from Abu Dhabi to avoid default. During the Arab uprisings of 2011, Dubai was seen as a safe haven for regional wealth, sparking a growth spurt that lasted until oil prices collapsed in 2014.\n\nMaktoum, the \u201cmoney man\u201d, has been quietly using the proceeds from privatisations and growing tax revenues to pay down Dubai\u2019s estimated $100bn-plus in bonds and loans \u2014 built up during the debt-fulled boom of the 2000s \u2014 and put the emirate\u2019s finances on a more sustainable footing.\n\nSome of this has come from Dubai\u2019s capital markets strategy, through which it is listing state-related entities to boost liquidity and compete more effectively with larger bourses in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.\n\nWhen he took effective power in 1995, Sheikh Mohammed turned Dubai into a global metropolis by boosting trade, developing infrastructure to attract investment and opening up new sectors in real estate, media and finance.\n\nSheikh Mohammed\u2019s advisers continue to wield influence, but they are gradually being eclipsed by Hamdan and Maktoum aides such as Mohammed al-Hussaini, minister of state for financial affairs, and Helal al-Marri, who heads Dubai\u2019s economic and tourist departments.\n\n\u201cHussaini reflects prudence, financial management and discipline,\u201d said Nasser al-Shaikh, former director-general of Dubai\u2019s department of finance. \u201cMarri reflects the growth agenda.\u201d\n\nHussaini is a board member at Dubai\u2019s national bank Emirates NBD and the $320bn Investment Corporation of Dubai that oversees state holdings in the city\u2019s leading companies.\n\nAt the finance ministry, he is overseeing the UAE\u2019s introduction of a 9 per cent corporate tax rate, which along with the sales tax of 5 per cent introduced in 2018 is expected to bring the government substantial revenues. However, analysts have warned that the levies will need careful management to avoid deterring investors previously attracted by the country\u2019s tax-free status.\n\nMarri, who is also on the ICD board, chairs the domestic stock market and is leading Dubai\u2019s drive to become a cryptocurrency hub and to double the economy\u2019s size by 2033.\n\nThe UK-trained chartered accountant, who has worked at KPMG and McKinsey, is seen as a bridge into the international business community. \u201cWhen you have an issue, you go to Helal,\u201d said a senior banker.\n\nYet although many Emiratis acknowledge the new leadership\u2019s effectiveness and commitment to fiscal prudence, the new era has ushered in an air of uncertainty.\n\n\u201cThis feels like limbo,\u201d said an Emirati businessman. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confidence in them, but the new crew are also somewhat unknown.\u201d\n\nAnd despite the brothers\u2019 growing influence, many businesspeople still believe it is their father who calls the shots.

Originally from Pakistan, Mohamad is uncomfortably dressed for the weather, wearing protective pads, dark trousers and the branded long-sleeved, high-neck top supplied by the delivery platform he works with.\n\nFrom July to early September, Dubai\u2019s streets are so hot and sticky that the \u201cheat index\u201d, a combination of air temperature and moisture levels, regularly exceeds 50C.\n\nLast month, temperatures in the forties and humidity levels of 80 per cent or more resulted in a \u201cfeels like\u201d temperature of 62C by midday at Dubai International Airport, US National Weather Service records show.\n\nThe Gulf is one of many regions learning how to live with extreme heat. Indian authorities have reported more than 40,000 cases of suspected heatstroke during a prolonged heatwave, and at least 110 deaths.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia this year, 1,301 pilgrims died after walking in temperatures that rose to nearly 50C during the hajj.\n\nBut individual experiences of the searing heat vary according to wealth. While Mohamad and thousands of other mainly foreign workers swelter in the open, the Gulf\u2019s vast hydrocarbon wealth has allowed its better-off residents to luxuriate in western-style cities that defy the inhospitable desert.\n\nMany of Dubai\u2019s upwardly mobile still jet off to cooler climes during the peak of the heat, but those who remain can avail themselves of facilities that keep them indoors during the hottest parts of the day.\n\nDubai has ice rinks and an indoor ski slope, while emperor penguins and Arctic foxes live in Abu Dhabi\u2019s SeaWorld, a vast indoor theme park. In the region\u2019s shopping malls, the air is so chilly that one Dubai expat carries a jumper with her while shopping during summer, and says she looks forward to winter so she \u201ccan be warm again\u201d.\n\nThose determined to brave the blazing summer sun can swim in outdoor pools filled with chilled water or jog around the 1.14km air-conditioned outdoor path in Qatar\u2019s Umm Al Seneem park.\n\nBut the differing experiences of the well-off and the labourers, security guards and parking attendants that keep the Gulf functioning show how extreme climate risks entrenching and exacerbating inequality.\n\nAs the world warms, the region may serve as a lesson on how \u2014 or how not \u2014 to deal with scorching temperatures in urban environments which are home to tens of millions of people.\n\n\u201cRight now what you\u2019re seeing in the Gulf countries is what you\u2019re going to see in many parts of southern Europe, or the southern US, or in parts of India and Bangladesh,\u201d says Barrak Alahmad, a research fellow at Harvard University\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health.\n\n\u201cThis is the opportunity for the Gulf countries to actually lead the field [in heat safety]. And I think it\u2019s a missed opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe region in which the modern United Arab Emirates sits has been called \u201cthe land of the empty bucket\u201d, because of the rapid evaporation of water.\n\n\u201cBy and large, the region lacks the three fundamentals of human settlements\u201d of water supply, an agricultural hinterland and a moderate climate, says Karim Elgendy, an associate fellow at London-based Chatham House who specialises in urban sustainability in the region. For centuries, the absence of such basics put a cap on the region\u2019s growth.\n\nPetrodollars changed all that, allowing many Gulf states to buy expensive technology like desalination units and air conditioners and to import more food. \u201cThose financial resources have enabled [Gulf societies] to live despite their climate, not in harmony with [it],\u201d says Elgendy.\n\nHaving overcome nature, and with the hydrocarbon industry booming, the population of the Gulf Cooperation Council states exploded from under 4mn people in 1950 to nearly 30mn by 2000, according to UN estimates. It then almost doubled again to reach 58mn by 2019.\n\nCities in the Gulf expanded on the back of fossil fuel exports. But the emissions from burning those fuels have contributed to the climate change that has made the region\u2019s summer heat ever more intense.\n\n\u201cThe Gulf region is already uninhabitable in summer without cooling systems,\u201d says Diana Francis, assistant professor of earth sciences at Abu Dhabi\u2019s Khalifa University.\n\nBut since the region is already equipped to survive under such conditions, \u201cthe impact of rising temperatures on the population will be felt less than in other regions where no cooling systems exist\u201d, she says.\n\nA lack of historical data means little is known about how the climate has evolved in the Gulf compared with other regions. But older Emiratis recall a very different environment six or seven decades ago.\n\nGrowing up in Dubai in the 1950s, political scientist Abdulkhaleq Abdulla remembers summers being less hot and shorter. Houses were open, to channel fresh air, some had ventilation towers, and families would sleep on flat roofs.\n\n\u201cOne fan for the whole family was enough then,\u201d recalls Abdulla. Today, almost every room in a middle-class Dubai home has air conditioning.\n\n\u201cIt appears that over the last 40 years, summer temperatures in the UAE have increased by about 1C,\u201d says Francesco Paparella, an assistant professor at NYU Abu Dhabi and principal investigator at the Mubadala Arabian Center for Climate and Environmental Science. That compares with an average global temperature rise of at least 1.1C since the industrial age began around the 1850s.\n\nRising humidity adds to that. For every 1C increase in temperature, a given volume of air can hold 7 per cent more water vapour. This year, conditions were exacerbated by record sea temperatures in the Gulf, contributing to high humidity levels that affect humans\u2019 ability to cool themselves by sweating.\n\nScientists say the wet bulb temperature, a measure of heat stress, is critical. Most studies suggest that beyond 35C, reached after six hours of exposure to temperatures of more than 40C and a humidity level of 75 per cent, humans can no longer cool themselves down.\n\nResearchers such as Paparella stress that a lack of data makes it hard to forecast what the Gulf\u2019s climate will be in future, although some scientific studies suggest intense rainfall and storms will increase.\n\nIn a \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d scenario where the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change are not drastically reduced, researchers estimate that after 50 years, \u201cunprecedented super- and ultra-extreme heatwave conditions will emerge\u201d in the Middle East and north Africa region, he says, with temperatures potentially exceeding 56C.\n\nEven the glittering skyscrapers built by ambitious Gulf leaders are not well adapted to such a worsening climate.\n\nThe glass and steel downtowns \u2014 what Elgendy calls \u201cspaceships in the desert\u201d \u2014 required large supplies of desalinated water and constant cooling. \u201cWhen you fully glaze a building, all that heat gets trapped inside and then you need to air-condition it out,\u201d says Elgendy. \u201cIt\u2019s a really poor choice.\u201d\n\nBut the region\u2019s cheap and abundant fossil fuel energy meant there was little incentive to find alternative solutions.\u00a0Cooling accounts for up to 70 per cent of electricity consumption during peak hours in the Gulf states, putting a huge strain on electricity grids.\n\nThe UAE has introduced green building codes \u201cbecause of the realisation that the kind of buildings we have in the desert cannot be the same as those you find in New York\u201d, says Leonard Chirenje, assistant professor of sustainability sciences at Abu Dhabi\u2019s Zayed University.\n\nTo make air conditioning more efficient, some Gulf countries are also using district cooling, which circulates cold water from a central facility through insulated pipes into buildings rather than relying on individual air conditioning units.\n\nTabreed, the listed Dubai district cooling company, says it supplies services across the region to buildings ranging from the office complexes of Saudi Aramco, the oil and gas giant, to commercial towers on Bahrain\u2019s waterfront. District cooling is also planned for Saudi Arabia\u2019s futuristic Line city, under-construction in Neom.\n\nSome developments have experimented with reviving traditional building techniques. The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence uses clay facades for shade, which have a noticeable cooling effect, on the campus named after the Abu Dhabi ruler.\n\nBut most of the Gulf\u2019s ways of coping with climatic extremes still involve enormous amounts of greenhouse gas-producing energy, notes Paparella. Cheap fossil fuels mean that renewable energy sources are caught \u201cbetween a rock and a hard place\u201d.\n\nConstruction activity is relentless in the Gulf, as the region builds to accommodate expected further increases in population. Saudi Arabia, the biggest economy in the GCC, is building whole new conurbations such as Neom and New Murabba, a new downtown in Riyadh.\n\nBut research suggests that construction workers, often itinerant labourers from south Asia, are among the most vulnerable to the extreme weather conditions.\n\nData is scarce but in Kuwait, Harvard epidemiologist Alahmad and his colleagues found that non-Kuwaiti men were up to three times more likely to die during extreme heat conditions compared with normal weather, despite the workers generally being young and fit.\n\nAlthough climate is not the only culprit for this vulnerability among migrant workers \u2014 they can suffer everything from cramped accommodation to problems getting healthcare \u2014 heat is aggravating these issues, Alahmad says.\n\nResearchers, led by Bandana Pradhan from the Institute of Medicine at Kathmandu\u2019s Tribhuvan University, concluded that high incidences of fatalities from heart disease among Nepali migrant workers in Qatar during the hot season were \u201cmost likely due to severe heat stress\u201d.\n\nOf the 571 Nepalis who died from cardiovascular disease from 2009 to 2017, some 200 could have been saved through \u201ceffective heat protection\u201d, their analysis concluded.\n\nQatar and other GCC countries have taken steps to reduce the risks of outdoor work during the summer. All of them now ban outdoor work during the middle of the day, though the hours and dates vary.\n\nSome city authorities go further \u2014 the municipality of Dubai, for example, says companies should provide workers with cold water and electrolytes.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a productivity issue,\u201d says one construction company boss, who agrees with the 12.30 to 3pm restriction in the city. \u201cAt 50 degrees what is he [the worker] going to do for you?\u201d\n\nHowever, the International Labour Organization says that temperatures can still be \u201cextremely high outside of the banned hours, and limited inspections undermine the policy\u2019s effectiveness\u201d.\n\nThe middle-of-the-day ban is also inflexible and does not take into account other factors that can affect human health, says Alahmad, such as humidity and the task the person is performing.\n\nIronically some of the lowest-paid migrant workers in the Gulf, who bear the brunt of its brutal summers, have left their home countries because of climate change.\n\nLow-lying Bangladesh, the country of origin for millions of construction workers in the Gulf, has been severely hit by changing weather patterns and rising sea levels.\n\nBournemouth University researcher Nirmal Aryal says similar factors are at play in his home country of Nepal, where increasingly unpredictable weather patterns have disrupted the subsistence farming upon which many Nepalis depend.\n\nAryal has been investigating the instance of kidney disease affecting returning migrant workers, although he says there is not yet enough data to definitively blame hot working conditions. The need for evidence, and collaboration with Gulf countries, to study the effect of heat stress on workers is urgent, he says.\n\n\u201cNepal is a poor country [and] migrant workers are the poorest of the poor,\u201d Aryal says. When workers return home with nephrological diseases, the cost of kidney dialysis has \u201ca significant social and economic impact\u201d.\n\nIn Dubai\u2019s touristy JBR area, a parking assistant hides in the shade of an umbrella. Also called Mohammad, he hails from Kerala in southern India, and came to the UAE nine months ago after his bachelors degree in commerce failed to land him a job.\n\nHe rates his situation \u201cfive out of ten \u2014 it\u2019s too hot\u201d, but is optimistic his lot will improve with Dubai\u2019s balmy winters. The 27-year-old is one of 3.5mn UAE-based Indians, whose home country is no stranger to blistering heat.\n\nBefore the monsoon rains break India\u2019s summer heat, pedestrians in the coastal commercial centre of Mumbai quickly become drenched in sweat thanks to high humidity and headache-inducing temperatures.\n\nAlthough families in India\u2019s rapidly growing middle class are installing air conditioning units, poorer Indians often remain dependent on fans \u2014 both at home and in the Gulf.\n\nZeyed University\u2019s Chirenje, who is originally from Zimbabwe, says climate change and new cooling technologies have opened a Pandora\u2019s box of sociopolitical issues. \u201cIs access to that technology the same for everyone?\u201d he asks. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nHe describes the conditions of an African woman he knows, who works as a maid in the UAE.

They were unsure what to expect next.\n\nThe women were attending one of the first toned-down weddings that the oil-rich Abu Dhabi government says will better adhere to \u201cauthentic Emirati values\u201d. Dubai, the emirate home to the Middle East\u2019s glitzy finance and tourism hub, is trying something similar.\n\nModest wedding initiatives are a rare insight into the tensions between tradition and modernity that permeate Emirati society, which petrodollars and global trade have propelled from impoverishment to riches in barely three generations.\n\nThere\u2019s a demographic factor behind official concern. Rulers want to reverse the trend of fewer weddings, more divorces and fewer babies. While the United Arab Emirates has welcomed foreigners to build its growing cities and develop its economy, migration has made nationals a shrinking minority in their own country, outnumbered by at least nine to one.\n\nHessa Buhumaid, director-general of Dubai\u2019s Community Development Authority, which oversees Dubai\u2019s scheme, said it sought to \u201chelp a larger segment of young men and women to marry at an early age, aimed at increasing the number of Emirati families in the country\u201d.\n\nEven as Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah position themselves as wedding destinations for foreigners with cash to splash, anxiety about the ballooning extravagance of Emirati weddings has long simmered. In the early 2000s, anthropologist Jane Bristol-Rhys estimated that Emirati couples invited 800 people on average, in weddings costing about \u201c$280,000\u201d. She describes \u201cmonstrous floral arrangements, statuesque ice-carvings, canopies and columns that are in turn decorated with metres of colourful silk and ribbons.\u201d\n\nThe bling level has risen ever since. \u201cI\u2019ve seen planes fly overhead during the end of ceremonies, releasing colour clouds,\u201d one wedding industry insider told the Khaleej Times. \u201cI\u2019ve seen giant 6ft-tall cakes suspended from ceilings.\u201d\n\nSome Emiratis argue that royal families have led the trend for lavish weddings. Last year, the daughter of Dubai\u2019s ruler Sheikha Mahra wed in a diamond necklace, flanked by clouds of white flowers. Like many marriages in the UAE, the union did not last.\n\nEmirati authorities have tried to bring down marriage costs, even offering loans. Decades ago they capped the traditional dowry (mahr), offered by the groom\u2019s family, at Dh50,000 ($14,000). But Abu Dhabi\u2019s \u201cMedeem Model for Women\u2019s Weddings\u201d initiative \u2014 the women\u2019s wedding is the event at which female friends and family celebrate a bride \u2014 may be the first time the local government has issued detailed guidance in an attempt to change standards.\n\nUnder the Medeem Model and the Dubai Wedding Programme, also introduced this year, Emirati couples will be eligible for loans and subsidies if they opt for scaled-back celebrations, often organised with government-selected event planners and held in specific halls \u2014 or better still, a family home. Couples may also undertake counselling, as part of a more holistic approach aiming at stable marriages.\n\nAbu Dhabi\u2019s plan gives a 250-guest and three-hour limit, discourages live entertainment, wasteful buffets and wedding cakes (finger food is fine), and suggests brides choose \u201ca modest and moderate dress that lets [her] shine rather than distracting\u201d.\n\nThe event I attended was held at the groom\u2019s family home and scheduled from 4:30-7pm, in line with the new model. Floral decorations were gorgeous and waitresses circulated with endless canap\u00e9s. The bride\u2019s dress was spectacular. But there was no DJ, no dancing, no grand cake and no selfies.\n\nAlthough some Emirati women agree that wedding excess has gone too far, others don\u2019t want to see a traditionally fun girls\u2019 night rendered boring. They remind me that the government initiatives are merely suggestions, and there are no rules preventing blowout parties. \u201cI loved the weddings at night, with a DJ,\u201d sighed one guest. \u201cMore shiny.\u201d\n\nchloe.cornish@ft.com", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/127a311c-8503-4c0d-a624-3333c03f0da5"}}, {"id": "b668f048-d61f-42e3-a193-9842bbd3a140", "event_name": "Abu Dhabi\u2019s ADQ buys stake in Sotheby\u2019s", "blurb": "The $1bn cash injection comes as owner Patrick Drahi\u2019s telco empire is struggling with debts", "date": "2024-08-0900:00:00.0", "body": "Abu Dhabi-based sovereign wealth fund ADQ is to take a stake in Sotheby\u2019s as part of a $1bn capital injection alongside existing owner Patrick Drahi as the auction house seeks to cut debt and fund growth.\n\nADQ and Sotheby\u2019s said in a joint statement on Friday that the investment fund had \u201csigned a definitive agreement\u201d to buy a minority stake via newly issued shares.\n\nThe cash will be used to \u201creduce leverage and support the company\u2019s growth and innovation plans,\u201d they said, adding that Drahi would also put in additional money and remain Sotheby\u2019s majority owner. The parties did not provide a valuation for the company.\n\nDrahi acquired Sotheby\u2019s in 2019 in a deal that valued the auction house at $3.7bn, including debt. That the Franco-Israeli entrepreneur is now willing to accept a partner represents a change in position from what people close to him said in December, namely that he did not need to sell nor bring in outside investors.\n\nThe bulk of Drahi\u2019s holdings are in telecoms and owned by his Altice group, although Sotheby\u2019s sits in his personal holding company.\n\nIn June, S&P Global Ratings cut the auction house\u2019s credit rating to B minus from B, citing \u201cpressured profitability and continued Ebitda decline.\u201d The agency highlighted \u201cpotential refinancing risk\u201d given Sotheby\u2019s \u201celevated leverage.\u201d\n\nSotheby\u2019s parent company Bidfair had $3.5bn in long-term debt at the end of last year, according to corporate filings in Luxembourg.\n\nThe deal with ADQ is expected to close before the end of the year. The fund\u2019s involvement is a reflection of how many rich buyers of artwork and collectors\u2019 items increasingly hail from the oil-rich Gulf states.\n\nFounded in 2018, the sovereign wealth fund is tasked with fuelling development in the oil-rich emirate of Abu Dhabi. Chaired by the UAE\u2019s powerful national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, ADQ also invests abroad, and earlier this year announced $35bn investment plans in Egypt.\n\nThe Sotheby\u2019s stake falls outside ADQ\u2019s priority sectors, which span energy to agriculture, healthcare and logistics. However, a person close to the fund said it could lead to a Sotheby\u2019s opening in Abu Dhabi, which has invested heavily in bringing art and culture to the emirate.\u00a0The Louvre Abu Dhabi opened in 2017, and construction on a Guggenheim gallery has begun.\n\nDrahi has been selling off assets lately as a wall of debt starts looms. His holding company Altice was built during an acquisition spree starting around 2014 that splashed out about \u20ac50bn and was partly funded with cheap borrowing. It expanded to include US cable companies, French telecom operator SFR, and other smaller communications groups from Portugal to Israel.\n\nHis deals often used creative financing methods and leverage: the purchase of a 24.5 per cent stake in BT was built through substantial loans and derivatives financing, allowing Altice to borrow heavily against the shares, according to people familiar with the situation and loan documents seen by the Financial Times.\n\nIn November, Altice struck a deal to sell a majority stake in its data centre business in France, valued at \u20ac764mn, to a Morgan Stanley infrastructure fund.\n\nIn March, Drahi agreed to sell French 24-hour news channel BFM and RMC radio to Rodolphe Saad\u00e9, the billionaire owner of CMA-CGM shipping group, for \u20ac1.55bn in cash. This month, Altice sold an online video advertising group called Teads to digital marketing group Outbrain for about $1bn.\n\nOther assets like Portugal Telecom have been on the block for more than a year, but have not found buyers. In Portugal, Altice was rocked by a corruption probe in which one of Drahi\u2019s long-standing lieutenants was alleged to have embezzled money through procurement contracts.\n\nThe company has said it did not know of the problems, and is co-operating with prosecutors.\n\nIn 2023, Sotheby\u2019s parent company based in Luxembourg reported interest expenses of $267mn, from $218mn the previous year.\n\nRevenue fell to $1.36bn in 2023 from $1.4bn the previous year because of lower auction services revenues and a decline in inventory sales.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rob Smith in London", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/12532986-ee2d-46f0-97e3-67759ec7f7a7"}}, {"id": "eac61a74-5b94-4743-b2e4-b43318a48c33", "event_name": "Mysterious Russia-linked buyers amass LNG \u2018dark fleet\u2019 ", "blurb": "Acquisition spree has driven up prices of older vessels as Moscow prepares for tighter trade restrictions  ", "date": "2024-07-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Mysterious buyers with suspected links to Russia have begun amassing dozens of vessels capable of carrying liquefied natural gas, in moves that suggest Moscow is expanding its \u201cdark fleet\u201d of energy tankers.\n\nShipping industry insiders say a clutch of previously unknown companies, largely registered in the United Arab Emirates, have rapidly acquired LNG vessels over the past year, driving up market prices, especially for the oldest ships.\n\nThe buying spree has echoes of how Moscow established a dark fleet of tankers to shuttle oil around the globe in the face of western sanctions, often using the UAE as a centre for energy trades. Although Russian LNG sales are less affected by western sanctions than oil, Moscow has been preparing for restrictions to tighten.\n\nSince the second quarter of 2023, more than 50 LNG vessels have changed ownership to companies located in the UAE, according to Windward, a risk consultancy for shipowners and governments. Prior to that, such transactions were rare.\n\nShip tracking group Kpler\u2019s risk and compliance team said the developments in the LNG tanker market pointed \u201cto a complex network of maritime operations potentially linked to Russian interests\u201d.\n\nSome of the Dubai-based groups have opaque ownership structures that are similar to those operating Moscow\u2019s dark fleet of oil tankers.\n\nSome of the newly acquired LNG vessels are now navigating routes traditionally used for transporting gas from Russia, according to Kpler. Its ship-tracking data showed one vessel loading LNG from Yamal, Russia\u2019s flagship export project that has yet to be hit by sanctions.\n\nLNG has grown in importance for Russia\u2019s wartime economy, providing valuable income after the loss of pipeline exports to Europe since its full- scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Both the EU and Asia, big markets for Russian LNG, have refrained from imposing a ban on imports to avoid disruption to the global gas market.\n\nBut the west has begun to take steps to restrict trade. In June, the EU approved restrictions that will forbid the unloading of Russian LNG from large icebreaking ships on to smaller vessels at EU ports, significantly limiting Russia\u2019s options for distributing its gas globally.\n\nRussia\u2019s big LNG project, Arctic LNG 2, has also been placed under sanctions by the US, making it increasingly difficult to ship cargoes out of the project.\n\nTraders say more opaque fleets could facilitate trading out of projects under sanctions, as well as boosting Russia\u2019s operations in the market.\n\nThe increased buying has driven up the price of cheaper and less efficient LNG ships that are more than 15 years old, according to data from SSY, a shipbroker that facilitates vessel sales between owners. One LNG vessel built in 2007 sold for about $50mn in 2022, but this year, one was sold for $80mn.\n\n\u201cThe market for old steam turbine LNG ships had declined with increasing environmental regulations, as well as dramatic improvements in LNG propulsion technology,\u201d said Toby Dunipace, managing director of LNG at SSY. \u201c[But we have] seen a resurgence in the value of these types of vessels. Some of the explanation could be that they are going to the dark fleet.\u201d\n\nThe developments have alarmed those in the industry already concerned by a rapid increase in the number of ageing vessels trading restricted oil, used by shipowners moving Russian cargoes outside of the western sanctions regime. Such ships are less likely to be insured against disasters but are much more vulnerable to accidents and spillages.\n\nDunipace said SSY\u2019s LNG team always puts new customers through a sanctions check, but recent developments have put the risks \u201cmuch more in focus\u201d as Russia prepares for future restrictions on LNG exports. He added that the broker has already had to turn down a handful of potential customers this year, including one last week, due to failed sanctions checks.\n\nSergey Vakulenko, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it was a \u201cno brainer\u201d that Russia wanted to build up its LNG dark fleets, with pressure \u201cincreasing\u201d on Russian LNG.\n\nWith the risk of market disruption set to be reduced in coming years as the US and Qatar produce more LNG, Russian projects such as Yamal LNG could come under sanctions, he said.\n\n\u201cI think that the Russian LNG operators think that the writing is already on the wall and are preparing for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trade-off is simple. If the sanctions do not happen, they have their own fleet and use it, and if the sanctions do happen, they are not stuck and can continue their trade.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f74756c8-82a5-4977-ac80-7fe6cda630ac"}}, {"id": "4de8dd6f-2132-48ef-8428-f0044febcea3", "event_name": "UAE willing to join multinational force for Gaza", "blurb": "Gulf state is first nation to say it could put boots on the ground as part of postwar plan", "date": "2024-07-1800:00:00.0", "body": "The United Arab Emirates has signalled it is willing to send forces to a multinational \u201cstabilisation\u201d mission for Gaza after the Israel-Hamas war, becoming the first nation to say it could deploy boots on the ground in the strip.\n\nThe Gulf state said it could deploy its forces if the US provides a leadership role and supports steps towards a Palestinian state. The comments by Lana Nusseibeh, special envoy to the UAE foreign ministry, come as Arab states and the west struggle to devise a viable postwar plan for Gaza.\n\nNusseibeh told the Financial Times that Abu Dhabi had discussed the plans with the US as a step to fill the vacuum in besieged Gaza and address its massive humanitarian and reconstruction needs.\n\nShe said the UAE would only take part if invited by the Palestinian Authority, the western-backed body that administers limited parts of the occupied West Bank.\n\n\u201cThe UAE could consider being part of the stabilisation forces alongside Arab and international partners\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009at the invitation of a reformed PA, or a PA led by an empowered prime minister,\u201d Nusseibeh said. \u201cThe United States should have the lead on this for it to succeed.\u201d\n\nNusseibeh said Abu Dhabi had, \u201cand continued to have, conversations on the \u2018day after\u2019 with all the concerned actors in the region\u201d.\n\nThe Gulf state normalised relations with Israel in 2020 and has maintained communication with the Jewish state since Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack triggered the war and Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive in Gaza.\n\nDetails of the mission, including whether it was a military or police force, were still being discussed.\n\nThe US has been encouraging Arab states to take part in a multinational force for Gaza as part of its postwar planning, but it is not expected to deploy American troops.\n\nDiplomats have previously said that Egypt, which shares a border with Gaza, and Morocco, which normalised ties with Israel in 2020, were also considering the plan.\n\nIn May, the Arab League called for a UN peacekeeping force to be deployed in Gaza and the West Bank until a Palestinian state was established.\n\nBut the notion has been met with scepticism as the deployment of any force would face massive hurdles and depend on Israel\u2019s actions.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected any moves towards a Palestinian state. He refuses to countenance any role for the PA in Gaza and insists Israel will retain overall security control there.\n\nHe has also rejected Hamas\u2019s demands that Israel withdraw its troops from Gaza at talks mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt to halt the conflict and secure the release of Israeli hostages.\n\nOther Arab officials have expressed concerns about being seen as entering Gaza on the back of Israeli tanks, and the risks of being drawn into fighting an insurgency there.\n\nHowever, Nusseibeh said the alternative to the stabilisation mission was \u201cto do more of the same, and that will only lead to more violence, radicalism and suffering for both Palestinians and Israelis\u201d.\n\nThe UAE is considered to have one of the best trained Arab armies, and its forces have participated in at least six US-led coalitions since the 1990s, including in Afghanistan, Bosnia-Kosovo, Somalia and the fight against Isis. It also deployed troops in Yemen\u2019s civil war as part of a Saudi-led coalition fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.\n\nIt is one of the few states to have a presence on the ground in Gaza as it operates a field hospital in the strip and delivers aid.\n\n\u201cThe plan [for Gaza] has to be what we believe is needed: a humanitarian component to help the Palestinian people in Gaza recover from the terrible destruction; [and] a security component,\u201d Nusseibeh said. \u201cAnd a political component that can facilitate a sustainable resolution of the conflict.\u201d\n\nArab states have insisted that to ensure a sustainable resolution to the crisis, the US must pressure Israel to take irreversible measures towards a two-state solution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nBut they have also been frustrated by the lack of reform of the weak PA \u2014 led by octogenarian president Mahmoud Abbas for almost two decades \u2014 since October 7.\n\n\u201cFor us, what it would take [to participate in the mission] is US leadership, a reformed PA leadership and a road map towards reuniting Gaza and the West Bank under a single Palestinian government,\u201d Nusseibeh said. \u201cWe [also] would need to see a clear articulation, a signal or a commitment to Palestinian statehood through negotiations.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/922b1a12-9c39-4927-838c-9631143939eb"}}, {"id": "dc8e9e68-6190-47af-a4f2-fc605eb5ac6e", "event_name": "UAE: A temporary international mission is needed in Gaza", "blurb": "The countries in the region can and must play a critical role in helping to achieve peace", "date": "2024-07-1700:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is assistant minister for political affairs and special envoy of the UAE minister of foreign affairs\n\nTwo weeks ago, the United Arab Emirates evacuated a group of severely injured children and cancer patients from the Gaza Strip to Abu Dhabi. This was the 18th mission we have undertaken to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza over the past nine months. We have delivered almost 39,000 tonnes of urgent supplies, established six desalination plants, provided a floating hospital to treat the wounded and deployed a field hospital. Together with our partners, the UAE has been at the front line of responding to the suffering in Gaza.\n\nWith almost 40,000 killed and close to 90,000 injured, according to Palestinian officials, it is clear that a ceasefire and the release of all hostages and prisoners is vital \u2014 which we advocated for relentlessly during our recently concluded term on the UN Security Council. We extend our full support for the mediation efforts undertaken by Egypt, Qatar and the US.\n\nAs the international community considers how to approach the post-conflict period in Gaza, the UAE has been clear that the goal cannot be a return to the status quo before October 7. Any \u201cday after\u201d effort must fundamentally alter the trajectory of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict towards the establishment of a Palestinian state that lives in peace and security with the state of Israel. Our collective response to the horrors of war and occupation must lead to a sustainable and just peace.\n\nThat is why we must together pursue a strategy that breaks the cycle of violence in Gaza and lays the foundation for a different future for Israel and Palestine. A first step in such an effort is to deploy a temporary international mission that responds to the humanitarian crisis, establishes law and order, lays the groundwork for governance and paves the way to reuniting Gaza and the occupied West Bank under a single, legitimate Palestinian Authority.\n\nA temporary international mission focused on these four priorities can be a central part of a broader strategy to help the Palestinian people achieve their legitimate national aspiration of statehood through meaningful negotiations.\n\nA temporary international presence in Gaza can only result from a formal invitation from the Palestinian Authority. This must come from a government that is led by an empowered, credible and independent new prime minister, ready to tackle the reforms that are necessary to improve governance for all Palestinians and capable of taking on the responsibility of rebuilding Gaza.\n\nIsrael, as the occupying power, must also do its part for such an effort to succeed. Gaza cannot recover if it continues to live under a blockade. Neither can it be rebuilt if the legitimate Palestinian Authority is not allowed to take on its responsibilities. No effort will succeed if settlement construction, violence and incitement to violence continue to rise in the occupied West Bank.\n\nSuch a mission will need the full and steadfast backing of all relevant stakeholders that are committed to peace. With different capabilities and resources at our disposal, each of us can play a critical role in this process. The countries in the region can and must contribute significantly, for peace between Palestinians and Israelis is first and foremost in our own interest.\n\nAlongside regional actors, the leadership of the US, both in Gaza\u2019s recovery and in efforts to revive the prospect of peace, remains indispensable. A reinforced and explicit American commitment to achieving the two-state solution, encouragement of Palestinian reforms and Israeli partnership as well as support for the international mission we suggest here are critical factors for success.\n\nIf post-conflict stabilisation and recovery are to follow from a ceasefire, there must also be rigorous monitoring and a system to enforce the ceasefire\u2019s terms.\n\nFinally, to operationalise an effective humanitarian response plan that begins Gaza\u2019s recovery, a temporary international mission cannot, and should not, seek to replace the UN or the work of its agencies on the ground. Rather, it must work in partnership with the UN system and amplify its resources and mandate.\n\nWe are under no illusions. We know that advancing such an effort will be extremely difficult. However, from our long experience of this conflict, we are confident that most Israelis and Palestinians yearn for peace. We believe that this stabilisation and recovery mission is a path out of the conflict and towards realising that yearning.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/cfef2157-a476-4350-a287-190b25e45159"}}, {"id": "719dfa3a-7b3c-4de9-a9f4-8511dbb21eae", "event_name": "What the revived World Islands tell us about a fast-transforming Dubai ", "blurb": "The resuscitation of this project for the super-rich is a reminder of who the nation is attracting ", "date": "2024-07-1500:00:00.0", "body": "Seabirds screeching overhead and sun bouncing off his pristine white kandura, Ali Sajwani surveys his dominion from behind mirrored sunglasses. The property scion and billionaire\u2019s son, 33, has paid over Drh500mn \u2014 more than $130mn \u2014 for this pair of empty islands lying off the coast of Dubai. The land is younger than he is.\n\nCreated by state-run developer Nakheel when Sajwani was around 12, this peculiar neighbourhood is known as the World Islands. Hover above it and the artificial archipelago would resemble a blotchy world map \u2014 one that is largely uninhabited. Dreamt and dredged up during Dubai\u2019s first property boom in the mid-2000s, the World Islands fell victim to the crash following the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nBut now, with luxury property values in Dubai skyrocketing, Sajwani and others are betting that the World Islands can be resuscitated.\n\nLast year, 431 homes priced at $10mn or more were sold in Dubai, collectively worth $7.6bn. That was more than any other city in the world, according to property consultancy Knight Frank.\n\nThe trend has brought fresh allegations of Dubai\u2019s open economy and property market being used to wash the proceeds of international criminality \u2014 a charge that Emirati economists say is unfair, and downplays the role of traditional laundromats such as London and Switzerland.\n\nWhy does Sajwani think Dubai has become a magnet for the mega rich? The self-described adrenaline junkie, whose father Hussain founded Dubai-based developer Damac Properties, cites factors such as security, governance and investor friendliness (plus, there is no personal income tax).\n\n\u201cAlso it helps in a big way [that] the rest of the world is sort of falling apart,\u201d Sajwani said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think Europe is going to come out of this\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009If you look at all the people moving here, they\u2019re the wealthiest people from Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t feel safe any more,\u201d he continued, citing concerns about wearing an expensive watch in cities from London to Geneva.\n\nAzure water laps the shore as Sajwani gazes out to a palm-fronded enclave where Dubai\u2019s royal family has a palace.

The World Island called Lebanon was the first to offer a beach bar and sun loungers. The upmarket Anantara resort opened on Argentina in late 2021. While curious holidaymakers do visit, some projects are a little threadbare. Take the Heart of Europe islands, the brainchild of Austrian developer Josef Kleindienst, still spiked with cranes despite construction starting a decade ago.\n\nSajwani decided to buy the S\u00e3o Paulo and Uruguay World Islands as the property market heated up in late 2022 and early 2023. He then hired and fired two architects before finding one who designed 24 villas for the island, each with a dock. Residents are likely to spend winters here, Sajwani said. They will have to commute by boat. Meanwhile, the island has no infrastructure at all \u2014 some solar panels will be installed but diesel generators will provide most of the electricity.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t put off buyers.

If you didn\u2019t give them the value that they dreamt of, they could go to the bank and borrow at zero interest and continue their growth story. They don\u2019t need you.\n\n\u201cNow [higher rates] triggered a realisation to the market that the valuation they were thinking of is not real.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, cash-rich buyers from the US and the Gulf states have stepped up their dealmaking in the capital-intensive sector.\n\nMasdar, which is funded by the UAE\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, its power and water company Taqa and its national oil company Adnoc, has amassed a $30bn portfolio of renewable projects.\n\nAs well as Terna, it recently bought 49 per cent of the UK\u2019s \u00a311bn Dogger Bank wind project, a \u20ac1.6bn slice of a wind farm in the Baltic Sea and a 50 per cent stake in US wind, solar and energy storage group Terra-Gen.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadian infrastructure investor Brookfield and Singaporean state investment fund Temasek said last month they were in exclusive talks to buy French solar and wind developer Neoen at a \u20ac6.1bn valuation, after the company said it needed more capital for growth.\n\nConnor Teskey, head of renewable power at Brookfield, said at the time the talks were announced that he expected to see more deals.\n\n\u201cIn order to capture all this demand [for renewable electricity], these businesses need to be supported by very well-capitalised, deep-pocketed shareholders. That is in no way a criticism of the shareholders of the past that have built these great businesses and turned them into great platforms but there is simply a different scale that is required for this next chapter of growth.\u201d\n\nOther big deals in the space include KKR\u2019s \u20ac2.8bn takeover of Germany-headquartered renewable power producer Encavis, which is expected to close at the end of this year\n\nMasdar has turbocharged its dealmaking in order to meet its target of 100GW of renewable capacity by 2030. It currently has roughly 20GW of projects either up and running, being built or in development.\n\n\u201cWe needed to shift gear,\u201d Al Ramahi said. \u201cWe needed to start looking at and assessing new opportunities that are large and at scale. We had to start thinking about making big acquisitions.\u201d\n\nDespite growing concerns in many European governments over foreign ownership of critical energy infrastructure, Al Ramahi said Masdar had so far not run into any issues.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen that we are not welcomed anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the contrary, all doors have been opened for us everywhere we have gone.\u201d\n\nHe added that he was neutral on using Chinese-made solar panels or wind turbines. \u201cWe believe in an open liberal market.

MGX has been in talks with San Francisco-based OpenAI over its chip development plans, the Financial Times has reported, and Sheikh Tahnoon has spearheaded discussions between the UAE and US on AI.\n\nThe UAE is building AI capabilities in key sectors from healthcare to defence and\u00a0believes that AI can help its biggest enterprises become more efficient. Abu Dhabi\u2019s national oil company said the use of AI-tools helped to generate $500mn in cost savings last year through increasing production capacity and making operations more streamlined.\n\nThe UAE is up against stiff global competition. The US and China are battling to take a technological lead over AI, while start-ups in the UK, France and across Asia are attracting multibillion-dollar investment from international investors.However, the UAE\u2019s advantage is being able to provide unparalleled access to capital. Expectations that Abu Dhabi will invest heavily in AI projects overseas has also attracted industry leaders to the nation in recent months, from OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman to Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang.\n\nThe UAE has stockpiled chips needed to power large language models, with Al Olama estimating the country had amassed a backlog that would serve its needs for two years. However, US officials are also seeking to slow the shipment of some AI chips to the Middle East, including the UAE, according to Bloomberg.\n\nSome observers worry about the autocratic UAE having access to advanced AI technology.\n\nMarietje Schaake, international policy fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, said US policy around AI had so far been pragmatic, narrowly focused on combating China.\n\n\u201cThe singular focus on China means other countries can claim to be part of a like-minded coalition, and the US administration gladly turns a blind eye to their human rights violations in the meantime,\u201d said the former European parliament member.\n\nThis month, Abu Dhabi\u2019s Advanced Technology Research Council released its latest large language model, Falcon 2, which it said has been assessed by outside evaluators as performing as well or better than rival LLMs made by Meta and Google.\n\nATRC has also spun out a commercial AI company, AI71, to build models based on UAE government data from health authorities and the judicial system.\n\nThe government data gives the UAE a \u201cvery strong critical advantage in this game, where there are very few players that have a lot of proprietary data\u201d, said Faisal Al Bannai, ATRC\u2019s secretary-general.\n\nAbu Dhabi also opened Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, the world\u2019s first AI dedicated university, in 2019.\n\nThe institute has helped establish a pipeline for talent in the UAE, a major challenge for the country of only 10mn, most of whom are expats.

The Guptas had fled to the Emirates in 2018 but around two weeks before Sheikh Mohammed was touring the Eastern Cape, a Dubai court refused to extradite two of the brothers citing incorrect paperwork, a ruling South Africa\u2019s justice minister described as \u201cshocking\u201d.\n\nThe fact that South Africa nevertheless rolled out the red carpet for Sheikh Mohammed and his entourage is a sign of just how influential the UAE has become there and across the continent \u2014 and an illustration of the complexities this new alignment can sometimes bring.\n\nAs China pares back loans to Africa, the oil-rich Gulf state has become an increasingly important source of foreign investment. In 2022 and 2023, the UAE pledged $97bn in new African investments across renewable energy, ports, mining, real estate, communications, agriculture and manufacturing \u2014 three times more than China, according to fDi Markets, an FT-owned company tracking cross-border greenfield projects.\n\nA UAE official tells the FT that its total investments into Africa amount to $110bn, reflecting \u201cthe country\u2019s commitment to facilitating sustainable development and growth across the continent.\u201d\n\nThe UAE is now \u201cgoing toe to toe with Beijing\u201d, says Ken Opalo, an associate professor at Georgetown University in the US, of the nation\u2019s presence in Africa. While many of these investments will not materialise, he says, the Emirates has consistently been a top-four investor on the continent over the past decade.\n\nCompanies from the UAE have embraced projects in Africa that more risk-averse investors have avoided. Africa has much \u201cto offer in terms of commodities and minerals,\u201d says Hamad Buamim, chair of Dubai\u2019s main trading hub the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, despite the \u201cchallenges when it gets to policies and politics\u201d.\n\nThis wall of money is allowing the UAE to help shape not only their countries\u2019 economic destinies, but in some cases the political fortunes of some African leaders. When fighters from the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front were threatening Addis Ababa during Ethiopia\u2019s civil war in 2021, the UAE provided military drones to the government, according to a senior US official and Tigrayan leaders. The UAE official says it \u201csupports the institutions and people of Ethiopia rather than any particular parties or individuals\u201d.\n\nWhen Sudan\u2019s generals deposed Omar al-Bashir in 2019, the UAE stepped in to bail out the new regime, later lending some support to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in the civil war that erupted last year, according to a UN panel of experts. The UAE strongly denies backing either side in the conflict and has publicly advocated for peace.\n\nMurithi Mutiga, Africa Programme Director at Crisis Group, a non-profit, says the UAE\u2019s engagement in places like Sudan is partly motivated by its desire to counter Islamist extremism. But, he says, it has also seized the chance to diversify its economy with investments in food security, critical minerals and renewable energy.\n\nAll of that makes its impact ambivalent, Mutiga says. \u201cChina is a status quo power, Russia is a revisionist power and the UAE veers between the two,\u201d he adds, referencing two of the other major foreign players in Africa.\n\nWestern officials say the growing influence of the UAE and other Gulf countries in Africa adds a new layer of complexity. \u201cThis is the new world we\u2019re in, where you have middle powers and global powers operating on the continent,\u201d says one former official in the Biden administration, who did not want to be named.\n\nWhile the influence of Abu Dhabi \u2014 the UAE\u2019s oil-rich capital and foreign policy setter \u2014 has risen in recent years, Dubai, the region\u2019s financial and trading hub, has long been an important financial centre. African companies are choosing to base themselves there to trade with the rest of the world, says Buamim. \u201cThis is where Dubai really played its cards quite well: to be the gateway to Africa.\u201d\n\nThe number of African companies registered in Dubai has increased dramatically in the past decade, reaching 26,420 by 2022, according to the Dubai Chamber of Commerce. \u201cDubai is New York for Africans now,\u201d says Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, a professor of international politics at Oxford university who has studied Africa-UAE links.\n\nThe UAE official says that its engagement in Africa, from trade to food security and counterterrorism, was in pursuit of \u201cfostering a prosperous future based on mutual benefit\u201d. But some see the UAE\u2019s inroads into Africa as part of a larger vision to wield more power on the world stage.\n\nSaad Ali Shire, finance minister of Somaliland, the breakaway republic in which Dubai-based logistics business DP World has invested heavily, has no doubts about the Emirates\u2019 growing clout. \u201cThe UAE is a new superpower in Africa,\u201d he says.\n\nEmirati engagement with Africa fits into three broad, if overlapping, categories. The first is purely commercial, the second strategic and the third is a financial role, traditionally played by global centres such as London or Zurich, in which Dubai has become an attractive jurisdiction for Africans to trade, do business and park offshore money.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s driving this for the UAE, and of course for other Gulf countries as well, is the energy transition and the hard push for economic diversification,\u201d says Anna Jacobs, Crisis Group\u2019s senior Gulf analyst. \u201cAfrica really is this huge untapped market [with] minerals and agriculture.\u201d\n\nCommercially, clean energy is one area of interest. Over the past decade, Masdar, Abu Dhabi\u2019s renewable energy investor, has built infrastructure including five wind farms in South Africa, a battery energy storage system in Senegal and solar power facilities in Mauritania. Masdar is leading UAE plans to invest $10bn to increase sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s electricity-generation capacity by 10GW.\n\nBut UAE companies are also investing in fossil fuels. In May, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company bought a 10 per cent stake in Mozambique\u2019s Rovuma gas basin, acquiring it from Portuguese energy company Galp for around $650mn.\n\nIn real estate, Dubai Investments, a listed conglomerate whose biggest shareholder is Dubai\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, this year announced it would start work on a 2,000-hectare property development in Angola. The Abu Dhabi-based telecoms company formerly know as Etisalat, now e&, operates in 12 countries across Africa.\n\nUAE companies have begun to make a splash in mining too. International Resources Holding, a unit of International Holding Company, the $240bn Abu Dhabi conglomerate chaired by UAE national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, last year paid $1.1bn for a majority stake in Mopani, a Zambian copper mine previously owned by Glencore. IHR has also expressed interest in investing in mines in Angola, Kenya and Tanzania.\n\nLast year, Primera, an Abu Dhabi-based gold trader, was granted a 25-year monopoly by the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo for all small-scale \u201cartisanal\u201d gold supplies in the country. Much African gold, both legal and smuggled, passes through Dubai, according to experts and African government officials.\n\nPeter Pham, a former US special envoy to the Great Lakes region for President Donald Trump, describes UAE African mining ambitions as \u201crelatively benign\u201d and in line with Washington\u2019s interests. \u201cThey dilute the Chinese and they provide an alternative supply chain,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they can pull it off, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d\n\nNot all UAE investments are free of controversy. In Tanzania, authorities have been accused by human rights groups of violently forcing thousands of Maasai off their land to make way for a safari and hunting project linked to a UAE company. Blue Carbon, a Dubai-based private investment vehicle, has been accused by activists of seeking to grab millions of hectares of African forests in what they deem a greenwashing exercise after signing preliminary agreements in Liberia, Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe aimed at generating carbon credits.\n\nStill, many countries welcome the Emirates\u2019 interest. \u201cThe UAE is a very good partner to Kenya and many other countries,\u201d William Ruto, Kenya\u2019s president, tells the FT.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference UAE money has made is in logistics where Emirates\u2019 commercial and strategic ambitions overlap.\n\nDP World is present in nearly a dozen African countries after pouring some $3bn into the continent. It now operates ports from Mozambique on the Indian Ocean in the south to Algeria on the Mediterranean in the north and Angola on the Atlantic, virtually encircling the continent.\n\n\u201cOur entry into these markets is not driven by political agenda. It\u2019s driven by a business agenda that may derive other benefits,\u201d said Mohammed Akoojee, DP World\u2019s chief executive for sub-Saharan Africa. He acknowledges an overarching strategy of connecting Dubai to the continent via trade. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely that vision from the Emirates,\u201d he says. \u201cThe government of Dubai uses companies like DP World and Emirates [the airline] to build a global presence.\u201d\n\nAD Ports, an Abu Dhabi logistics company majority-owned by sovereign investor ADQ, operates fewer ports in Africa than DP World, but there are signs it wants to catch up. Last year, it won a 30-year concession to run Pointe Noire port in the Republic of Congo and in April it secured a 20-year concession to manage Angola\u2019s Luanda terminal, initially committing $250mn to its modernisation.\n\n\u201cIf the government is investing in its trading partners\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009then naturally you need the private sector to come in and invest,\u201d says Ross Thompson, AD Ports group chief strategy and growth officer.\n\nThe place where the UAE\u2019s port investments are most obviously strategic is Berbera, the main port of the breakaway republic of Somaliland, located on the Gulf of Aden, where UAE flags can be seen fluttering in the desert landscape. DP World has invested $300mn in the port and an adjacent free-trade zone, while the UAE has been refurbishing the coastal city\u2019s airport. Somaliland has also granted the Emirates a 25-year concession for a naval base.\n\nThe political ramifications go further. DP World took over Berbera port in 2017 shortly after the company was ejected from Djibouti, which accused it of \u201ccolonialism\u201d, allegations denied by DP World. Since its move 250km south to Berbera, the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development has spent almost $90mn building a smart new paved road linking Berbera with the capital Hargeisa and, crucially, on to the Ethiopian border.\n\nThis year, in a move that enraged Somalia, which rejects Somaliland\u2019s claim to independence, Addis Ababa signed an agreement with Hargeisa. In return for recognising Somaliland as a legitimate state, landlocked Ethiopia would gain access to a stretch of coastline on the Red Sea where it could develop a port and naval base.\n\nMany see the hand of the UAE behind the bold play. \u201cWhen it comes to the UAE government, they are seeking to have political influence in the region,\u201d says one senior Somali official.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s most controversial alleged actions in Africa have taken place in war zones. In 2019 and 2020, it actively supported General Khalifa Haftar, a Libyan warlord, after he launched an attack on Tripoli to oust the UN-backed government. The UAE has denied breaking an arms embargo on Libya.\n\nEven more controversial is the UAE\u2019s alleged fuelling of the Sudanese civil war by helping to arm General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti, an accusation the UAE has repeatedly denied. A former camel trader with previous links to the Emirates, Hemeti now runs the RSF paramilitary force fighting for control of the country. The RSF has been accused by Human Rights Watch of committing ethnic cleansing in Darfur.\n\nDespite the UAE\u2019s denials, an independent panel of experts for the UN says there is some evidence it was supplying arms in the guise of humanitarian aid through Chad. \u201cThe UAE is not playing by any rule book in Africa,\u201d says Cameron Hudson, a Sudan expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cThey\u2019re chaos agents in Sudan.\u201d\n\nAlbadr SS Alshateri, professor at the National Defence College in Abu Dhabi, says he has no knowledge of the UAE\u2019s alleged backing of Hemeti. But the UAE does suspect that the Sudanese army, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, may be closely linked to Islamists. As a general rule, \u201cthe UAE sees itself as pursuing stabilisation,\u201d Alshateri says.\n\nThe third role that the UAE is playing in Africa is that of freewheeling financial hub.\n\nOxford\u2019s Soares de Oliveira says western legal firms, investment banks and wealth managers all offer services in Dubai \u2014 including arbitration over disputes \u2014 that companies from Africa and elsewhere have traditionally sought in London and Geneva.\n\n\u201cDubai is the ideal ecosystem: it offers the same blue-chip world-class services that are essentially Anglo or Swiss, but it is lawless enough to be a free for all,\u201d he says.\n\nDubai is still considered a more flexible jurisdiction despite being removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) \u201cgrey list\u201d this February after two years on the naughty step, he says, although centres like London are still conduits for suspicious transactions.\n\nMany of the 26,000-plus African companies registered in Dubai are \u201cletterbox companies\u201d, says Soares de Oliveira. \u201cThat allows Africans to keep dollars away from African economies. You pay suppliers in Dubai and the money never comes back.\u201d\n\nWealthy Africans, including politically exposed persons, also find a safe harbour in Dubai where they can buy property and enjoy a world-class lifestyle. Other high-profile residents include Isabel dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of Angola\u2019s former president, who moved to the city in 2020 days after the new Angolan government froze her assets.\n\nThe expanding presence of the UAE and other Gulf countries in Africa and vice versa presents a quandary for Washington.\n\nThe US does not approve of everything the UAE is doing there, says the former Biden administration official, but it regards it as a vital global ally, including in the Middle East. \u201cIt\u2019s such a challenging actor,\u201d he adds. \u201cIn Africa, they\u2019re both investing in positive ways and acting in destabilising ways at the same time.\u201d\n\nHudson at the Center for Strategic and International Studies is more sceptical. \u201cIt may be OK in the near term,\u201d he says. \u201cYou let me do what I want in Sudan and I\u2019ll give you what you need in Gaza. That\u2019s a very transactional relationship, but it\u2019s not a friendship.\u201d\n\nAlshateri at Abu Dhabi\u2019s National Defence College says the UAE\u2019s rise is tied to Washington\u2019s declining influence in Africa: \u201cThey had to pick up the slack because the US is backsliding on its security commitment.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/388e1690-223f-41a8-a5f2-0c971dbfe6f0"}}, {"id": "aedf392e-a223-4f25-a44f-41558d7124d7", "event_name": "Bulk of gold smuggled from Africa exported to UAE, says report", "blurb": "Illicit trade now accounts for about 40% of continent\u2019s production, according to Swissaid ", "date": "2024-05-2900:00:00.0", "body": "The UAE has been accused of being a leading recipient of tens of billions of dollars worth of gold smuggled out of Africa every year, reflecting growing concern over the illicit trade in the region\u2019s precious metals.\n\nIn a comprehensive study, Swissaid estimated that about 435 tonnes of gold worth about $31bn were exported undeclared out of Africa in 2022 \u2014 a doubling of illicit volumes in a decade to about 40 per cent of the continent\u2019s production, or 12 per cent of global mined supply.\n\nThe UAE, whose dominant regional trading hub Dubai is known for its gold market, accounted for 93 per cent of undeclared African exports, the NGO\u2019s report said. The next two biggest importers were Switzerland and India.\n\nAfter gold prices hit record highs earlier this year, the figures will intensify scrutiny of illegal mining in conflict zones such as the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan as well as the role of the UAE\u2019s precious metals industry.\n\nMarc Ummel, one of the report\u2019s authors, said the Financial Action Task Force, the international body that tackles money laundering, should reconsider the removal in February of the UAE from its \u201cgrey list\u201d of countries.\n\n\u201cYou should not be removed from the list when you have 400 tonnes that come to your country illegally,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big quantity of money leaving Africa connected to money laundering, conflict and human rights issues that does not benefit the people who extract the gold and are trying to support their families.\u201d\n\nEmirates Gold, one of the nation\u2019s largest refineries, was suspended last year from accessing Dubai and London\u2019s gold markets, which require anti-money laundering and responsible sourcing standards. The refiner said at the time that the suspension had nothing to do with its compliance processes and it has always abided by responsible sourcing and anti-money laundering practices.\n\nA UAE official acknowledged there have been \u201cconcerns around gold smuggling into Dubai\u201d, but said the country had \u201cimplemented detailed new regulations for gold and precious metals to mitigate these risks effectively\u201d.\n\nThe extraction of gold by \u201cartisanal\u201d miners has been a long-standing issue for the gold sector but has become more acute after a surge in prices for the metal. Gold hit a record $2,400 per troy ounce in April as emerging market central banks led by China snapped up bullion to diversify their reserves away from the US dollar.\n\nAmong African nations, Mali, Zimbabwe and Ivory Coast had the largest volumes of undeclared gold production, the report said.\n\nThe UAE introduced new regulations on gold refineries in 2023 to improve due diligence when sourcing gold, including screening and conducting site visits of artisanal mines. But the Gulf state has disputed whether its approach to accepting artisanal and small-scale mining is harmful to the individuals digging and panning on the ground.\n\nLast year Primera, an Abu Dhabi-based gold trader, was granted a 25-year monopoly by the Democratic Republic of Congo for the trade and export of small-scale \u201cartisanal\u201d gold supplies, in a move aimed at combating the smuggling trade. The central African country is fighting rebels in its eastern border regions, where a mining belt holds vast amounts of gold.\n\nArmed groups including the M23 militia control supply chains into Rwanda and Uganda, analysts and Congolese officials say. The US Treasury has said most DRC gold was smuggled into neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda, where it was refined and exported mainly to the UAE.\n\nKigali has repeatedly denied Rwanda benefits from what Congo claims is the $1bn a year it loses from the unauthorised export of minerals, adding that its mining sector is \u201cfully regulated and monitored\u201d and \u201ctraceability is compulsory\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Congolese are saying that we steal\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. their gold,\u201d Rwandan President Paul Kagame said in November 2022. Most of what \u201cgoes through here does not stay here\u201d, he added. \u201cIt goes to Dubai, to Brussels, to Tel Aviv\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and they accuse us of stealing Congolese minerals \u2014 how about the destination?\u201d\n\nThe UAE was the main destination for the vast majority of artisanal gold extracted in the 18 African countries on the EU\u2019s list of conflict-affected and high-risk nations, the report added.\n\nHowever, the UAE official added that the country required all gold refineries \u201cto comply with due diligence regulations for responsible sourcing of gold, which is aligned to the OECD due diligence guidance for responsible supply chain of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas\u201d.\n\nEarlier this year, the US sanctioned Al-Fakher Advanced Works, a holding company that the Treasury department said exports gold for the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces that have been fighting the Sudanese army in a brutal civil war.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f67a65da-6197-4193-8fe0-e1d90594ab94"}}, {"id": "e23a433e-91de-436c-b674-1159175e2410", "event_name": "Russia sanctions are ineffective, says Dubai trade hub chief", "blurb": "Measures imposed on Moscow do not halt business but simply redirect it, DMCC chair says ", "date": "2024-05-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Sanctions on Russia are having no impact outside the west and attempts to halt the flow of business merely redirect it elsewhere, the chair of Dubai\u2019s main trading hub has said.\n\n\u201cSanctions slow the economy, never stop it,\u201d said Hamad Buamim, chair of the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, a leading United Arab Emirates free trade zone that says it hosts more than 24,000 businesses. He is also the former president of Dubai\u2019s chamber of commerce. \u201cTrade continues flowing, it just flows in a different way,\u201d he told the Financial Times in an interview.\n\nBuamim\u2019s comments come as Dubai leverages its geographical position between east and west to cement itself as a node for world commerce at a time when sanctions imposed on Russia over the war in Ukraine, economic protectionism and US-China tensions are reshaping global trade.\n\nDubai is seen as a beneficiary of US and European attempts to isolate Russia\u2019s economy, as oil traders relocated from Geneva to the UAE after Switzerland joined the sanctions imposed on Moscow. Energy is the most important sector for the DMCC, according to Buamim, with some 3,000 energy companies registered in the zone.\n\nHowever, in recent months the UAE, along with other countries, has been under pressure from the US, EU and UK to act against companies trading with Russia.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the economy is not purely controlled by one side of the world makes these sanctions less effective,\u201d Buamim said. \u201cIf we just take the Ukraine conflict, [sanctions] are effective when you look west, but they are not really effective beyond that.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe don\u2019t see them as a great tool to make any impact. They are just making trade more complex and impacting the whole world.\u201d\n\nThe US has in particular targeted international banks that finance trade deals. The UK has also imposed sanctions on the Dubai-based oil trader Paramount Energy & Commodities DMCC, an entity set up two years before G7 members imposed a price cap on Russian oil. The group is a subsidiary of Paramount Energy & Commodities SA, a Swiss group founded by veteran Dutch trader Niels Troost, which is also subject to UK sanctions.\n\nThe European parliament, meanwhile, has voted against removing the UAE from the EU\u2019s \u201cgrey list\u201d of high-risk countries, alleging it had made lacklustre efforts to address Russian sanctions evasion. The issue is now with the European Commission.\n\nThe restrictions have made it difficult for Russia to produce advanced weapons and sustain the rate of fire it maintained earlier in the war, according to defence analysts.\n\nThe CREA, a Finnish energy think-tank, said sanctions on Russian oil exports cost the Kremlin about \u20ac34bn in 2023, with almost all the cost coming from driving down the price of Russian oil.\n\nThis month, Gazprom also reported a $7bn loss after Russian gas exports halved in the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia has also faced significant price rises on types of imports targeted by sanctions and export controls.\n\nBut Buamim said the sanctions were not the reason companies had relocated to Dubai. \u201cIt is not the Russians that really dominated the growth. We had growth coming from Switzerland. We have companies from other countries. They see that Dubai has the infrastructure, the market access and the neutral stance [on the war].\u201d\n\nMany international companies that had to leave Russia also needed to find a location where their Russian staff would be welcome, he added.\n\nBuamim was speaking as the DMCC released a report on the future of trade that predicted increasing challenges from deglobalisation and climate change, balanced in part by the use of artificial intelligence to redraw and manage logistics.\n\n\u201cProtectionism has started to top the agenda of all politicians. Unfortunately, politics is driving decisions that are not commercially viable for the global economy,\u201d he said.\n\nUntil now, he said, the UAE and the Gulf states in general had managed to maintain a neutral position that was, for example, \u201cneither pro-American or anti-China\u201d. But this was becoming more difficult to maintain as the US started to ask countries to choose sides, he said.\n\n\u201cThat tension between the US and China is no longer a US-China problem,\u201d Buamim said. \u201cThis is a challenge for businesses throughout the world.\u201d\n\nThis story has been corrected to say that Hamad Buamim is the former president of Dubai\u2019s chamber of commerce, not its current president, and also to state that the DMCC-based subsidiary of Paramount Energy & Commodities SA was set up two years before G7 members imposed a price cap on Russian oil.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5183dd85-87f0-4f6f-a655-1abc78f084ad"}}, {"id": "6937bd58-e351-4af3-96a4-c946159ea40f", "event_name": "Abu Dhabi conglomerate embarks on flurry of mining deals", "blurb": "Business owned by IHC broke into market last year with acquisition of a major Zambian copper mine", "date": "2024-05-2700:00:00.0", "body": "The mining business owned by $240bn Abu Dhabi conglomerate IHC has embarked on a flurry of deals in Africa, after breaking into the market last year with its acquisition of a major Zambian copper mine.\n\nIHC chief executive Syed Basar Shueb told the Financial Times that its IRH subsidiary had signed joint venture agreements for iron ore mining in two places in Angola \u2014 Kassala Kitungo and Munenga \u2014 and that it was in advanced talks to mine nickel in Burundi as well as various metals in Tanzania and Kenya.\n\nIHC expected to make about $1bn of mining acquisitions this year, Shueb told the Financial Times.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi group\u2019s foray into the mining industry comes as BHP\u2019s \u00a334bn approach for rival Anglo American highlights the race to secure access to minerals such as copper, iron ore and lithium that are critical to the transition to cleaner energy.\n\nAsked who IRH was bidding against for mining assets, Shueb said the \u201cmajority of the time you\u2019re competing with Chinese.

But Shueb said the group had been formed from different mining interests belonging to IHC and Royal Group, an investment group also chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon that preceded IHC.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s a mining or a refinery business of the gold, or the trading side of the business, we have consolidated everything under IRH,\u201d Shueb said.\n\nHe said IRH\u2019s strategy was to buy mining concessions, as opposed to providing investment to other operators in return for future supply of raw materials, and that it wanted to make its mining projects \u201cgreen\u201d by using renewable energy sources, such as solar power.\n\nIRH did previously have some involvement in a gold trading scheme in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\u00a0The company said it had facilitated an arrangement between Auric Hub Gold Refinery, an Abu Dhabi gold and silver refinery, and gold trading business Primera Gold DRC, which last year won a 25-year monopoly for hand-dug gold in the DRC.\n\nHowever, Shueb said this trading operation was now being handed over to the DRC government.\n\nHe also said IRH was discussing taking over Konkola Copper Mines with the Zambian government.

Emirati officials were dismayed when then-prime minister Boris Johnson failed to call or issue any public statement of support shortly after the event.\n\nThis year, the UK\u2019s ruling Conservative government raised questions over the autocratic state\u2019s media record, and effectively blocked an Abu Dhabi-backed \u00a3600mn takeover of the Telegraph Media Group. The failed bid had been backed by vice-president Sheikh Mansour, whose brother is the Gulf state\u2019s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed. The UAE government was not directly involved in the deal.\n\nOne UK government figure said there was \u201cnervousness\u201d inside Whitehall that blocking the Telegraph deal could further delay a long-awaited trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes the UAE as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\n\nMore recently, the UK called a meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the ongoing bloody war in Sudan, in which more than 15,000 people have been killed.\n\nAt the meeting, to which the UAE was not invited, a representative of the Sudanese Armed Forces accused the UAE of backing its opponent, the Rapid Support Forces.\n\nEmirati officials strongly deny the claims of involvement, and foreign secretary Sheikh Abdullah spoke directly to Cameron about the incident, according to people briefed on their discussions.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office said: \u201cThe UK enjoys a strong relationship with the UAE and is committed to working closely on a range of issues.\u201d The UAE ministry of foreign affairs did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRising concern about the UK\u2019s conduct comes as the UAE\u2019s own global star rises as an increasingly influential Arab power.\n\n\u201cThe UK was in the top five, maybe even top three of the UAE\u2019s allies and partners since the UAE\u2019s establishment,\u201d said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political science professor and senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\n\u201cThings have changed over the past 50 years, the UAE is a rising regional power\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and the UK is apparently stuck in the past, does not realise there is a new UAE,\u201d he added.\n\nThe pair are still working on Gaza, energy and climate issues, and the relationship has come through rocky patches before.\n\nBut some analysts said this time the UK needed to show contrition.\n\n\u201cThe UK has to understand that when the UAE is angry, you have to take the UAE seriously,\u201d said Abdulla. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time the UK pays us a visit and says sorry.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fdd7563d-1222-47af-bc33-1205bdb38702"}}, {"id": "dc04c6e5-bbf6-4ab5-8b14-2f66de41ff6e", "event_name": "The quest for interesting conversation", "blurb": "From someone who relies on it for ideas, this is how to find it", "date": "2024-05-1100:00:00.0", "body": "The nearest thing to stress in this job is having to come up with ideas each week. Some arise from private thought. Some, though fewer than most imagine, come from reading. But much the richest source is conversation. And so the most important \u201cwork\u201d I do is the cultivation of interesting people. I know the secrets of how and where to find high-grade talk. Readers might care to know a few.\n\nThe distracted host gets up once more to check on the fricass\u00e9e. The guests, several of whom have just met, pause at intervals to overpraise the cooking. On top of all this, as we are in someone\u2019s home, pressing a point too hard in conversation is just awkward. The result? Fragmented chit-chat. No chance of developing an argument. The language of dinner parties is a blur of second-hand aper\u00e7us (\u201cThis is the end of the end of history\u201d) that we might call podcast-ese.\n\nTake it out of the domestic\u00a0space. The philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas cited the role of the coffee house in the flowering of western thought. These allowed intellectual life to move out of private domains into an argumentative \u201cbourgeois public sphere\u201d. Well, for late-1600s coffee house, read restaurant, bar or indeed coffee house. Something about the neutral setting equalises people and loosens tongues.\n\nSoon after meeting someone, mention Dubai. If it provokes a smirk, and a jibe at the crassness of the place, that is useful. You can filter that person out.\n\nKnocking Dubai took over long ago from knocking LA as the blandest opinion in the world. The case for the Gulf city? The transfer of power from the west is visible there as it is nowhere else: in the Asian big-spenders, in the Russian sanction-dodgers. You needn\u2019t like the place, but to not find it stimulating is to not find this century stimulating.\n\nLots of places are diverse. Dubai is cosmopolitan, to an extent London alone among western cities can touch, and that spirit infuses the old quarter near the airport as much as the bling centre. Looking down at the city, and at new-money Brits who love \u201cDoobs\u201d, has come to characterise a certain kind of box-ticking, not-very-elite elitism, like having an Elena Ferrante on the go.\n\nOf course, someone can be anti-Dubai\u00a0and\u00a0interesting, but we don\u2019t have hours on end to find out. We need heuristics, rules of thumb, to triage the original from the generic, and none works better than the Dubai test. (By the way, of the most bankable conversationalists I know, those who most often inspire columns, four live or have lived in Dubai.)\n\nThe top person in an organisation won\u2019t be its most interesting. Hence the emptiness of chief executive philosophising. Managing people and processes requires high intelligence, no doubt, but not so much intellectualism, if that means a taste for abstract thought. Look for people a notch or two down, then: those who were too dreamy to be leadership material.\n\nA caveat: while it is rare for the executive temperament and the intellectual temperament to coexist in one person, it isn\u2019t unheard-of. Isaac Newton ran some important organisations after founding classical mechanics, which I suggest bolsters his claim as the ablest individual who ever lived. (Tossing out statements as sweeping as that is another useful filter, by the way. Interesting people will enjoy running with the question of who was the ablest human being. The pedestrian mind will nitpick. \u201cHow can we judge?\u201d etc.)\n\nAnd so to the rule that shapes my life. People don\u2019t know when they are being interesting. Someone will yak away for an hour on their core theme and then, as we settle the bill, mumble something en passant that unlocks an entire column idea. The gold is so often in the digression.\n\nSo while it is true that, compared to those who raised me, I have never done a day\u2019s work, I am condemned to a life of perpetual listening, lest a globule of someone else\u2019s insight gets lost in the wind. A columnist is never \u201coff\u201d. The cost of freedom is said to be eternal vigilance.

The shares were later trading up 5 per cent on the day.\n\nBankers say the listing has been closely watched by executives considering launching their own offerings. They believe its success may encourage other private sector companies to come to market in the Middle East\u2019s financial hub Dubai, whose stock exchange has traditionally been dominated by state-linked companies.\n\nSpinneys\u2019 flotation \u201cwill hopefully engage other entrepreneurs and families to follow this trend\u201d for large, family-owned businesses to come to market, said Ali Khalpey, Dubai-based head of equity capital markets syndicate at EFG Hermes.\n\nPrivately held schools group Taaleem listed in Dubai in 2022 and Al Ansari Financial Services made its market debut in 2023, the first such listings for years.\n\nGulf supermarket operator LuLu Group has also said it is planning an IPO in the region, without specifying on which exchange.\n\nPreviously, IPOs have been dominated by government-owned companies. Parking operator Parkin listed earlier this year, the most recent state-owned company to do so, while several larger state entities \u2014 including Dubai utilities group Dewa \u2014 floated in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe first saw a lot of government-related entities, that was to deepen the stock market and get more flow,\u201d said Monika Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. \u201cA natural progression of that would be to get more private sector companies coming in.\u201d\n\nFive flotations raised $8.5bn in 2022 in what was a strong year for Dubai IPOs, according to Dealogic data. However, last year there were just two IPOs raising $525mn.\n\nBoth Dubai and Abu Dhabi are pursuing ambitious economic plans as the former tries to expand its economy beyond trade and tourism and the latter looks to diversify away from oil. Both have their own bourses, and are trying to increase the number of listed companies in their capital markets in order to attract investors.\n\nSpinneys, which is majority owned by the Al Bwardy family, priced at Dh1.53 per share and raised Dh1.4bn ($375mn), giving the retailer an implied market capitalisation before trading began of Dh5.5bn ($1.5bn).\n\nAnalysts say the narrow range of stocks listed in Dubai has helped boost demand for the shares.\n\n\u201cEven though people liked the macro economic picture [in the UAE], apart from the banking sector there were limited ways to play the growth story, the outlook and diversification plans,\u201d added Malik. \u201cA company like Spinneys is a way to bet on population growth.\u201d\n\nAsset manager Franklin Templeton is a cornerstone investor in the IPO, alongside Abu Dhabi investment group Emirates International Investment Company.\n\nSpinneys opened its first shop in Dubai in 1961, just as oil discoveries in the United Arab Emirates were opening the petrodollar floodgates, creating enormous wealth and attracting legions of foreign workers.\n\nToday its 75 stores \u2014 including those operating under the banner of UK supermarket chain Waitrose \u2014 cater mainly to expatriates and wealthy shoppers in the UAE and Oman. The company made revenues of Dh2.9bn in 2023, up 9 per cent from Dh2.6bn the previous year. It made a pre-tax profit of Dh256mn in 2023 and Dh215mn in 2022.\n\nTo boost growth the company is turning to Saudi Arabia, with plans to open its first store in the region\u2019s biggest economy this year, but none under the Waitrose banner, according to chief executive Sunil Kumar.\n\nJohn Lewis-owned Waitrose \u201cdon\u2019t want to go further than the UAE\u201d, he said. \u201cThe partnership board is not keen until and unless the Saudi market opens up to the new liberal way of John Lewis Partnership.\n\n\u201cThere is no liquor permitted in Saudi Arabia. So there is a restriction. There is no pork,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, Waitrose told the Financial Times that the decision not to expand into Saudi Arabia was not related to prohibited items. Instead, it said it was focused on a \u00a31bn expansion in the UK. \u201cThere are logistical challenges of getting into any new market on a significant scale, which aren\u2019t right for us at the moment,\u201d the company added.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a0a7f1d6-38ae-4372-8993-665cab26dfa4"}}, {"id": "d5b2d43b-2b13-4aea-badc-8edb70773bc6", "event_name": "UAE\u2019s al-Jaber invites business chiefs to climate talks on eve of COP29", "blurb": "Head of last year\u2019s climate negotiations holds event in Abu Dhabi for Silicon Valley and oil executives", "date": "2024-05-0900:00:00.0", "body": "Sultan al-Jaber is planning a final flourish as president of the UN COP28 summit by calling the heads of the world\u2019s largest energy and tech companies for climate talks in Abu Dhabi days before COP29 begins in Azerbaijan.\n\nJaber \u2014 who is also head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) \u2014 said he will invite chief executives from Silicon Valley and Big Oil for a \u201cChange Makers Majlis\u201d, or special gathering, at the start of November to discuss artificial intelligence and the energy transition.\n\n\u201cMy message to the tech sector is this: AI needs energy and energy needs AI,\u201d said Jaber, who is also the UAE minister for industry and advanced technology. \u201cLet\u2019s collaborate to drive down the emissions of the conventional energy you will still need, and on ways that AI can drive energy efficiency,\u201d he told the Financial Times.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi event \u2014 mirroring the majlis held during the COP28 negotiation \u2014 will take place immediately before Adipec, an annual conference also held in the capital that is typically attended by most of the chief executives of global oil majors.\n\nAhead of last year\u2019s COP28 negotiations, some questioned whether Jaber, as head of Adnoc, was a suitable president for the world\u2019s most important climate negotiations.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said after the COP summit that tougher action was needed on fossil fuels.\n\nBut in recent months, ahead of passing over the COP presidency to Azerbaijan\u2019s ecology minister Mukhtar Babayev, Jaber has occupied the limelight for his climate role, making speeches at climate conferences. He is due to speak about energy and AI at the Microsoft CEO Summit next week.\n\nThe UAE, Azerbaijan and Brazil, host of COP30, have formed a troika aimed at ensuring progress from one COP to the next.\n\nThe agreements made in Dubai included the first global undertaking to move away from fossil fuels and a commitment to triple renewable energy generation by 2030.\n\nHowever, there has since been little implementation of the pledges. The issue of how to finance the shift to a green economy is still being fiercely debated and is expected to dominate talks at this year\u2019s COP29 in Baku in November.\n\nJaber said he thought AI would be \u201cthe bridge\u201d for how the world could simultaneously \u201creduce emissions while also driving social and economic value everywhere\u201d.\n\nAbu Dhabi has positioned itself as a regional AI hub as it seeks to diversify beyond oil.\n\nAt the same time, the International Energy Agency has estimated that electricity consumed by data centres globally will more than double by 2026 to more than 1,000 terawatt hours, an amount roughly equivalent to what Japan consumes annually. This has also raised concerns about the effect on the environment.\n\n\u201cI know that AI is making grids much smarter by simply predicting peaks and dips and usage, it is also helping optimise the flow of electrons, to where they need to be.

Each will consist of a new biorefinery with capacity to process 20,000 barrels of fuel per day, associated infrastructure and planted areas to grow the input crop.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about feedstock [which] in reality is agriculture. And Brazil is probably the best-placed country on the planet when it comes to agricultural proficiency because of the climate and the fertile soil,\u201d said Oscar Fahlgren. \u201cBrazil is to agriculture what Abu Dhabi is to oil.\u201d\n\nThe initiative will also involve the conversion of an existing oil refinery in the north-eastern Brazilian state of Bahia acquired from state-controlled Petrobras in 2021. An expected total amount of $13.5bn is to be funded through a mix of equity and debt over a period of five to 10 years, said Fahlgren.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important capital project,\u201d he added. \u201cI see tremendous opportunity to invest in the green energy transition space in Brazil.\u201d\n\nThe group had previously only announced the estimated cost for the development\u2019s initial module. Mubadala Capital\u2019s bioenergy play will build on its $6bn of investments in the country, which represents about a quarter of the group\u2019s global portfolio.\n\nTwo-thirds of its capital in Brazil is from outside investors, with the remainder from parent organisation Mubadala. Its focus there is on businesses in situations of complexity or distress.\n\nThe eponymous sovereign fund first entered the South American nation in 2012 with a $2bn investment backing former tycoon Eike Batista, once one of the world\u2019s wealthiest people before the meltdown of his energy and commodities empire the following year.\n\nIn the fallout, Mubadala ended up the main creditor of Batista\u2019s holding group EBX and took ownership of several of his assets, including stakes in ports and mines.\n\nToday its portfolio includes a company that organises the S\u00e3o Paulo Formula 1 Grand Prix. Fahlgren described Mubadala\u2019s approach in the country as \u201ccontrarian\u201d, having remained through economic and political crises in the past decade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very active investing in Brazil, for the past 10-plus years, in an environment where most foreign investors have been shying away,\u201d he said.\n\nMubadala Capital had fully invested its second Brazil-focused fund that closed with $710mn of commitments last year, he added. Americas Trading Group, a financial assets trading platform it purchased in 2023, hopes to open a bourse in Brazil next year to rival the incumbent B3 in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\u201cBrazil is a very large country. It has only one stock exchange. And I think that\u2019s suboptimal infrastructure for the players that operate in this segment,\u201d said Fahlgren. \u201cIt will probably be a staged launch \u2014 perhaps start with equities, then expand. No asset classes are off the table.\u201d\n\nAnother focus is Zamp, which franchises Burger King restaurants in Brazil. Mubadala Capital has steadily increased its stake to 58 per cent and recently elected a majority of seats on the board, which now also includes an executive from fellow shareholder Affinity Partners, the private equity firm run by Jared Kushner. Affinity\u2019s investment was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nFahlgren said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the partnership with Affinity. \u201cIt just happened and we have no other specific investments earmarked, but I wouldn\u2019t rule it out,\u201d he added.\n\nMubadala Capital is also involved in talks for a proposed new football league in Brazil whose goal is to package up and sell the commercial rights.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish on the investment climate in Brazil right now and the opportunities we see,\u201d said Fahlgren. \u201cWe do have a number of assets that are relatively mature today, and could be potential exit candidates in the not too distant future,\u201d he added.\n\n", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/bef4fc45-3837-45fb-8704-a18483386dbf"}}, {"id": "88b01b2e-5054-4646-b7d4-247c9a2d32fc", "event_name": "Lucy Frazer demands speedy resolution to Telegraph saga ", "blurb": "Culture secretary says UK \u2018not stopping\u2019 foreign investment as she defends blocking sale to Abu Dhabi-backed company ", "date": "2024-05-0300:00:00.0", "body": "UK culture secretary Lucy Frazer has demanded fortnightly updates on the sale of the Telegraph newspaper to encourage a speedy resolution to a saga that she describes as one of the most \u201cintense\u201d periods of her ministerial career.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, Frazer defended the decision to block the sale of the media group to an Abu Dhabi-backed company but insisted it was not a signal the government was turning its back on investment from the region.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to make clear that we are open for business,\u201d said Frazer, who will travel to Saudi Arabia this month to drum up business for the UK cultural sector. She said letting the Gulf kingdom invest in British culture was \u201ctotally different\u201d to allowing foreign states to own UK newspapers.\n\n\u201cThis is a fundamental principle about freedom of our newspapers,\u201d said Frazer, adding that she had asked for biweekly updates on the sale of the Telegraph Media Group from RedBird IMI. \u201cIt\u2019s really important we don\u2019t impinge on democracy. In every other area \u2014 football [for example] \u2014 we\u2019re not stopping foreign investment.\u201d\n\nFrazer, culture secretary since last year, led efforts in government to first scrutinise and then change the law to block the takeover of the Telegraph Media Group by RedBird IMI, by barring overseas states from taking large stakes in the UK newspaper group.\n\nThe deal for the Daily Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph and Spectator titles became a political flashpoint, with MPs and peers voicing concerns over a foreign power exerting influence over a UK media group with strong links to the Conservative party.\n\nThis week RedBird IMI \u2014 a joint venture between US private equity firm RedBird and Abu Dhabi-based International Media Investments \u2014 said it would withdraw its offer and launch an auction in a bid to recoup the \u00a3600mn it paid for the broadsheet titles and the Spectator magazine.\n\n\u201cI was very conscious at every stage that the future of the Telegraph was potentially in my hands,\u201d she said, adding that the sale of the newspaper by Lloyds Banking Group jump-started a frantic effort in Whitehall to ensure it did not fall under the influence of a foreign power.\n\n\u201cWe worked as a department for about three weeks, nonstop over weekends, up till the early hours,\u201d Frazer said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for others to understand the intensity\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the sense of importance of the decisions that we\u2019re taking.\u201d\n\nRedBird IMI, which derives about three-quarters of its funding from Abu Dhabi but is managed by US executives, promised to maintain editorial independence of the Telegraph.\n\nBut Frazer said the deal raised a \u201cmatter of principle\u201d over foreign state ownership of newspapers. \u201cA foreign state is likely to buy a newspaper, not as a commercial entity, but to ensure that it gets very full coverage in a particular country. It\u2019s a pillar of democracy that you should be able to report without fear or favour,\u201d she said.\n\nRedBird IMI chief Jeff Zucker branded rivals for the titles hypocrites for attacking his bid, citing previous attempts by them to court RedBird IMI as part of bids for Telegraph Media Group. People close to the group also said the press in the UK was often heavily influenced by wealthy owners.\n\nMPs and media executives are now concerned that there will be months more uncertainty over the ownership of the Telegraph in the run-up to the general election expected this year.\n\nFrazer said she wanted an onward sale \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Responsibility for the sale rests with RedBird IMI, which needs to sell the debt behind the group with the option of converting into ownership.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of uncertainty for the Telegraph at the moment and has been for some time. If there is a significant matter that arises between those 14 days, I would like to be updated on it,\u201d she added.\n\nFrazer confirmed that the government would seek to cap any ownership by a foreign state of a newspaper group at 5 per cent, but added that she would consult on the plans first to ensure the new law had no \u201cunintended consequences\u201d, although this would not include the 5 per cent limit.\n\nSome media owners are concerned that the cap would make it impossible to finance future deals, or risk hitting passive sovereign wealth fund shareholders that already have stakes in listed UK and US companies.\n\nBut Frazer said 5 per cent seemed the right level to ensure no undue influence over a newspaper group, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to restrict all investment. What we are stopping is investing in a newspaper for the purpose of influencing the editorial.\u201d\n\nFrazer said the law would not be imposed retrospectively, which means it could not be used to review previous deals, such as a sale of large stakes in the Evening Standard and the Independent to a Saudi businessman.\n\nFrazer will have a chance later this month to demonstrate that her handling of the Abu Dhabi-backed bid for the Telegraph does not signal a move towards a more inward-looking approach to foreign investment.\n\nFor two days from May 14 she will be among ministers leading a cultural and business delegation, expected to include representatives of bodies such as the Royal Opera House and Science Museum, to Riyadh seeking Saudi investment.\n\n\u201cI think there will be lots of discussions about how the Saudis can learn from the UK and there will be discussions about investment by the Saudis into UK companies,\u201d Frazer said.\n\nShe said engagement with Saudi Arabia \u201cbrings benefits to them, exports our soft power abroad and brings investment into the country\u201d.\n\nFrazer acknowledged that London was engaged in a battle for Saudi investment with Paris, noting: \u201cThe French have spent a lot of time exporting their culture abroad.\u201d\n\nAsked if she would advise her hosts in Riyadh that they would be better off putting their money into British cultural institutions, Frazer said: \u201cOf course.

After the water was pumped out, Anwar had to dispose of 10,000 books spoiled by sewage water, which was not covered by insurance.\n\nScientists said heavy rainfall in years when the naturally occurring El Ni\u00f1o pattern warms the Pacific Ocean had become anywhere from 10 per cent to 40 per cent more severe, in a rapid study by the World Weather Attribution group.\n\nWhile the researchers could not precisely determine how much of the increase in such wet weather was due to human-caused climate change, they found that warming caused by burning fossil fuels was the most likely explanation.\n\nNot only does climate change mean the UAE has to contend with ever hotter summers as temperatures reach beyond 50C, it also faces the wetter weather fuelled by global warming.\n\nAlthough the sudden rainfall was the heaviest since records began 75 years ago, according to meteorological authorities, it was just the most recent deluge. Inundation has become frequent enough that Dubai\u2019s transport authority opened a flood management control centre in January.\n\n\u201cThey are not rare events for the Middle East,\u201d said Suzanne Gray, professor of meteorology and Reading University in the UK, who identified the tempest as being caused by an amalgamation of several high level thunderstorms, called a mesoscale convective system, typically hundreds of kilometres wide.\n\nScientists said that cloud seeding, a technique used by the UAE to help stimulate rain, was not to blame.\n\n\u201cWe know that man-made climate increases extreme rainfall \u2014 this is well understood physics as warm air holds more water,\u201d said John Marsham, Met Office joint chair at the University of Leeds. \u201cAny possible effect of any cloud seeding in these circumstances would be tiny.\u201d\n\nWith the UAE hosting the COP28 climate summit last year, awareness has grown about climate change dangers. The country has an adaptation plan, and Dubai was the first to apply for a UN scheme to become a \u201cCity Resilience Hub\u201d in 2020.\n\nUAE capital Abu Dhabi weathered the latest storm better than the larger glitzy trading and financial hub of Dubai. The futuristic city is the UAE\u2019s biggest by population and the location of the world\u2019s second busiest airport, which was forced to cancel more than 1,000 flights, leaving passengers stranded for days.\n\n\u201cThe infrastructure was built before these weather changes happened,\u201d said an insurance executive, who said it was too early to estimate overall damage costs. \u201cIn certain instances, the quality of construction by the developers was not good enough.\u201d\n\nSprawling Dubai was especially vulnerable to flooding because it was relatively flat, covered in impermeable concrete and asphalt surfaces, and its desert sands lacked the ability to grow vegetation that could absorb floodwater, said a Dubai-based town planning specialist.\n\nUnderlying those drainage problems is a groundwater table already oversaturated by irrigation and pipe leakage, a common issue in the Gulf. \u201cThe cities are really floating,\u201d said Hrvoje Cindri\u0107, Middle East planning lead at international engineering firm Buro Happold.\n\nWhen Dubai floods, he added, \u201cthe water has got nowhere to go\u201d.\n\nDubai officials over the years have considered comprehensive drainage systems but carried out limited works because of the high costs involved versus the perceived relatively low risk.\n\nUpgrades to the network have included a 10km drainage tunnel under southern Dubai, opened ahead of Expo 2020, to serve the huge exhibition facilities, which was also the site of the UN climate summit, and the airport.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t engineer for the worst possible scenario\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it\u2019s prohibitively expensive,\u201d said Huda Shaka, a chartered urban planner based in Dubai. But following the storm, \u201cit\u2019s not just a theoretical scenario. It has happened, and the costs are real.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the floods, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed al-Maktoum, the crown prince, approved a Dh66bn upgrade to the drain network. Tenders were first issued last year for the project, though bids were not received until February.\n\nThe announcement came after the UAE president Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan ordered officials to monitor the nation\u2019s infrastructure and \u201climit the damage caused,\u201d according to the state news agency.\n\nTown planning experts say Dubai could adopt \u201csponge city\u201d principles, making detailed flooding plans and allotting areas with permeable surfaces for better drainage. Given the damage sustained by many buildings, \u201cthere may be a need for tougher building codes,\u201d said a former Emirati official.\n\n\u201cNow the cost of mitigating [extreme weather] becomes not unreasonable,\u201d said urban planner Shaka, adding: \u201csometimes it takes an extreme event for action to happen.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a12272e7-536f-49ac-85d8-97e60dfec05e"}}, {"id": "1b33379b-802c-4c17-bb11-187beb109470", "event_name": "US seeks alliance with Abu Dhabi on artificial intelligence", "blurb": "Biden administration brokers talks between Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and the UAE, as Washington seeks edge over China", "date": "2024-04-2000:00:00.0", "body": "The Biden administration is proactively encouraging US tech groups to seek artificial intelligence deals and partnerships in the United Arab Emirates, seeking to cultivate an alliance that would provide it with an edge over China\u2009in developing the revolutionary technology.\n\nThis week, Microsoft announced a $1.5bn investment in G42, an Abu Dhabi-based AI group chaired by powerful Emirati royal Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed al-Nahyan, representing the tech giant\u2019s latest huge bet on AI.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the discussions, the deal was finalised following a series of meetings over the past year brokered by the US government between investors and companies from the UAE and American tech companies including Microsoft, Google and OpenAI.\n\nThe talks are part of Washington\u2019s efforts to achieve supremacy over Beijing in the development of artificial intelligence and other sensitive technologies.\n\nCommerce secretary Gina Raimondo has been closely involved, a person briefed on the negotiations said, as the highest levels of the US government worked to develop closer ties between American tech groups and Abu Dhabi.\n\nAnother critical figure is Sheikh Tahnoon, the UAE\u2019s national security adviser who also oversees a business empire and Abu Dhabi\u2019s biggest sovereign wealth fund.

It has launched MGX, a fund dedicated to AI deals, and is also expected to spend billions on research and development through government organisations such as the Advanced Technology Research Council.\n\nAI leaders, including OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman and chipmaker Nvidia\u2019s chief executive Jensen Huang, have become regular visitors to the Gulf state.\n\nAltman has travelled between the UAE and Washington this month, meeting government officials and investors to discuss how AI companies and governments in both countries can work together.\n\nThe OpenAI founder has discussed plans over an ambitious chip venture with Sheikh Tahnoon, seeking to raise billions of dollars to develop the semiconductors required to train and build AI models, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nAltman has also met America\u2019s ambassador to the UAE, Martina Strong and members of Congress and the US national security community to ensure there is enough energy, chips and data centre capacity to support the AI boom, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversations.\n\nWhile seeking stronger ties, US officials had previously expressed unease over the UAE\u2019s use of Chinese technology, particularly Huawei\u2019s 5G hardware, worried that China could use these networks to access information from an important US ally.\n\nUS lawmakers had scrutinised G42\u2019s links to Chinese companies, over concern that the company could provide a route for US AI technology and Americans\u2019 genetic data to reach the Chinese government and companies. G42\u2019s chief executive Peng Xiao was born in China, studied in the US and is now a UAE citizen.\n\nDuring a visit to Washington last year, Sheikh Tahnoon told his counterparts that he wanted to work towards a framework after Abu Dhabi took a \u201cstrategic decision\u201d to focus on US tech, according to a person briefed on the UAE\u2019s strategy.\n\n\u201cThe UAE views data as the new oil,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt realised that it had to find a new way to exist between the US and China because of US concerns about Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve since been having very productive conversations, with Raimondo in particular,\u201d the person added.\n\nGiven the sensitivities around national security, approval for the G42-Microsoft deal took months of talks with government officials on both sides, two people close to the negotiations said.\n\nOne of those people said the deal involved G42 pledging to remove Chinese technology \u2014 most importantly, hardware built by Huawei \u2014 from its systems.\n\nXiao told the Financial Times late last year that it was cutting links with Chinese partners in order to prioritise relationships with US companies, saying: \u201cWe are in a position where we have to make a choice\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. we cannot work with both sides.\u201d\n\nThe FT reported earlier this year that the group\u2019s venture capital arm had also divested its Chinese holdings.\n\nG42\u2019s deal with Microsoft means it will have to abide by US regulations. The two have signed an \u201cIntergovernmental Assurance Agreement\u201d, which the companies said was drawn up in \u201cclose consultation\u201d with Washington and Abu Dhabi.\n\n\u201cBoth companies will move forward with a commitment to comply with US and international trade, security, responsible AI and business integrity laws and regulations,\u201d G42 and Microsoft said in a statement.\n\nBrad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s vice-chair and president, told the FT the investment \u201creflects confidence by our company in the UAE as a country, in G42 as a company, and in Peng as its CEO\u201d.\n\nThe Microsoft-G42 deal appears to be the start of a broader alliance between the US and UAE over AI.\n\nThe commercial agreement represents \u201ca starting place to define the contours of the government-to-government co-operation and partnerships\u201d, said a person familiar with the UAE\u2019s thinking.

He added that the country was aiming for a \u201cjust right scenario\u201d on regulation, that was neither too soft nor too hard, while ensuring companies operating in the UAE were compliant when selling into other markets.\n\nRival nations have suggested AI start-ups face less strenuous regulation than in Europe.\n\nThe EU approved its AI Act last week, considered one of the world\u2019s strictest regimes over the technology, causing companies that offer services to European consumers to scale up compliance teams.\n\n\u201cThis is a cost that weighs heavy on some of those companies, in addition to high energy costs and an overall high burden of regulation,\u201d said Aleph Alpha\u2019s Andrulis. \u201cSo it\u2019s not ideal. I would have preferred that we focus on innovating first because innovation will secure our space in the future.\u201d\n\nThe UK has taken a more relaxed approach, relying on existing industry regulators to create rules around AI, rather than drafting bespoke new legislation. However, most UK-based AI companies are subject to the EU\u2019s AI Act because they operate in the bloc.\n\nParis-based Mistral was vocal in its criticism of the AI Act as it was being drafted. The company lobbied the French government during the negotiations, saying the strict rules would prevent European start-ups from competing with US-based giants. Mistral declined to comment on whether it had been approached over moves away from France.\n\nThe EU law\u2019s advocates, including competition watchdogs and civil society groups, said tougher regulation was necessary to prevent the potential harms caused by the rapidly accelerating technology.\n\nDespite the approaches, Synthesia\u2019s chief executive and co-founder Victor Riparbelli said it had no intention to move from the UK because the country offered a \u201cstrong international talent pool, world-leading universities in AI and the best funding environment in Europe\u201d.\n\nAleph Alpha also said it was committed to its headquarters in Heidelberg, Germany, and supporting \u201cEuropean values\u201d and \u201cthe European ecosystem\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe successfully hire people from the US tech giants [and] bring them to Heidelberg,\u201d Andrulis said. \u201cI pitch it to our international hires as the German Tuscany.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Javier Espinoza in Brussels and Leila Abboud in Paris", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/095184c2-45fe-47f5-9449-19223e3c1e03"}}, {"id": "6870b67d-f7f1-4a1a-846b-eb57dc415f06", "event_name": "Abu Dhabi in talks to invest in OpenAI chip venture", "blurb": "State-backed group MGX in discussions over ambitious plans by Sam Altman to build semiconductor business", "date": "2024-03-1500:00:00.0", "body": "A new Abu Dhabi investment company is in talks to back OpenAI\u2019s ambitious chip venture, in the latest effort by the United Arab Emirates to become a global powerbroker in the development of artificial intelligence.\n\nState-funded MGX is in early stage discussions over a funding deal with OpenAI, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. The US start-up\u2019s chief executive Sam Altman is seeking to launch a semiconductor business to reduce its dependence on cutting-edge chips made by Nvidia.\n\nEstimates from Altman and others of the cost of building out AI infrastructure have varied from hundreds of billions of dollars to as high as $7tn over the coming years.\n\nSuch figures price out traditional technology venture capitalists, leading the group to approach nation-states. The Financial Times this month reported that OpenAI was also holding talks with Singapore-backed Temasek over a funding deal.\n\nMGX, an AI-focused fund that launched this week, is chaired by the UAE\u2019s powerful national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The nation is betting its wealth, abundant energy resources and the political backing of the autocratic state\u2019s leadership give it a head start in the race to become a global AI hub.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking at creating a structure that will put Abu Dhabi at the centre of this AI strategy with global partners around the world,\u201d said a person briefed on the fund.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s AI minister Omar Sultan Al Olama told the FT that Tesla chief Elon Musk \u2014 who has launched xAI, a company building AI models in an effort to rival OpenAI \u2014 was also interested in partnerships with the Gulf state.\n\n\u201cI do see him [Musk] doing something [AI-related] here,\u201d said Olama, adding that he first met the billionaire in 2017 and has done so multiple times since. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s far out for him to do something here,\u201d said Olama. \u201cThe economics are going to dictate what he and others do here.\u201d\n\nMusk did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon, a brother of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, oversees a sprawling $1.5tn empire that includes two sovereign wealth funds as well as private businesses.\n\nHe chairs G42, a UAE-based group of AI-focused companies, which is backed by Abu Dhabi sovereign investment fund Mubadala and boasts partnerships with OpenAI, Microsoft and Cerebras.\n\nBy setting up MGX, in partnership with G42 and Mubadala, Sheikh Tahnoon said in a statement that Abu Dhabi was establishing a \u201cnational champion\u201d for AI that would \u201cfurther advance the UAE\u2019s role as a home and ecosystem for top technology talent, investors and entrepreneurs\u201d.\n\nAI\u2019s top players such as Altman and Nvidia chief Jensen Huang have been attracted by the UAE\u2019s ambition and financial firepower. The Gulf nation was an early mover in the nascent industry, appointing the world\u2019s first AI minister in 2017 and opening the world\u2019s first AI-focused graduate university two years later. The state has \u201cbeen talking about AI since before it was cool\u201d, said Altman at an event in Abu Dhabi last year.\n\nOlama said the country also has a \u201cbacklog\u201d of expensive Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), the semiconductors used to power large language models.\n\n\u201cWe need to constantly increase the stockpile to match with the ambitions that we have and the direction that we\u2019re going in,\u201d said the AI minister. \u201c[T]here\u2019s going to be a constant flow of investment from the UAE in this domain\u201d\n\nYet the UAE\u2019s plans have also required navigating the trade tensions between the US and China. In particular, Washington has raised concerns about G42 and its ties to Chinese companies including Huawei, which have been blacklisted by the US.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon visited Washington in June, where he discussed issues including \u201cthe importance of building trusted technology ecosystems\u201d, according to the White House. Following his trip, the UAE took a strategic decision to prioritise access to US tech partners, people familiar with the leadership\u2019s thinking said.\n\nG42 has since cut off its China partners and sold off its investments in the country \u2014 the latter move welcomed by Mike Gallagher, chair of the House select committee on the Chinese Communist party, who has been a vocal critic of the Abu Dhabi-based company.\n\nOlama said the UAE was not making a political decision to favour the US over China in any AI-related venture. \u201cThe UAE does not have an agenda that we\u2019re only going to work with one partner\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. It\u2019s always economics.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe want to ensure that AI is being applied in ways that are non-controversial, that can help us in the long term, that are responsible and are led by Emiratis if we can.

Nabil\u2019s lawyer and his brother were assassinated after he agreed to testify.\n\nAfter his extradition, prosecutors believe Taghi pulled strings from jail to order the murder of Dutch crime journalist Peter de Vries in 2021, who had reportedly been in touch with the crown witness.\n\nTwo men have been convicted of killing the lawyer, and a verdict in the De Vries case is expected in summer.\n\nProceedings in the Marengo trial were further thrown into disarray last year when Taghi\u2019s defence lawyer Inez Weski was arrested on suspicion of belonging to Taghi\u2019s criminal organisation. Weski was said to have passed on sensitive information from Taghi to outside contacts while he was in confinement.

It focused early on technology, eventually setting up an online platform that it now licenses to other banks as well as using it to originate loans.\n\nBut it really came into its own during the Covid pandemic when it processed more than $5.5bn in government-backed Paycheck Protection Program loans, and other banks using its software handed out more than $8bn more. However, Biz2Credit\u2019s strong fraud detection methods have drawn inquiries from regulators concerned that it took longer than the 14 days it advertised for PPP loan processing.\n\nPPP \u201creally showcased that we can build software at scale and we can use data to disperse a lot of money very quickly as well as prevent fraud\u201d, Arora said. \u201cOur mindset has now become, yes we can do a lot bigger things.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/45cb503c-658c-4b67-a318-78f06aeb6a31"}}, {"id": "e78ef773-ffc1-4eef-8853-dc6bd32a3f7e", "event_name": "Abu Dhabi steps in to ease Egypt\u2019s currency crisis with $35bn investment ", "blurb": "Cash for Mediterranean development could unlock IMF deal for most populous Arab country, say analysts", "date": "2024-02-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Abu Dhabi has agreed to invest $35bn in a large development site on Egypt\u2019s northwestern Mediterranean coast in a move that could ease a financial crisis in the country of around 110mn people.\n\nThe investment by state investment vehicle ADQ, which aims to build a tourism and financial centre in the Ras al-Hekma area, is central to unlocking a long-stalled agreement with the IMF for a loan package expected to top $10bn, analysts said.\n\nEgypt has been struggling with a severe foreign currency shortage for almost two years and the IMF has made its loan conditional on Cairo allowing the currency to move to a flexible exchange rate.\n\nHowever, authorities have been reluctant to allow market forces to set the value of the Egyptian pound because the central bank did not possess enough foreign exchange buffers to prevent a sharp fall against the dollar.\n\nThe official rate has been held at around E\u00a331 to the dollar since March 2023, but it has been trading on the black market at more than twice that value.\n\n\u201cThis deal is the missing piece of the puzzle to bring the IMF agreement over the line,\u201d said Mohamed Abu Basha, head of macroeconomic analysis at EFG-Hermes, a Cairo-based regional investment bank. \u201cThis will help resolve the immediate foreign exchange problem, and provide enough foreign currency liquidity to move towards a float.\u201d\n\nEgypt has been forced to go to the IMF for multiple loans since 2016 and is its second biggest debtor after Argentina.\n\nThe country has spent billions on infrastructure projects overseen by the military over the past decade.

Emerging markets from South Africa to Vietnam are on grey list, and getting off it, which means proving its anti financial crime processes are working properly, can take years of assessments and monitoring.\n\nBeing on the grey list does not impose restrictions on the country, but it acts as a red flag for international counterparties such as banks, often leading them to conduct heavier due diligence.\n\nMeasures taken by the UAE to get off the grey list have included bolstering its Executive Office of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terror Financing to crack down on illicit money, and beefing up legislation. The country also extradited several alleged financial criminals, introduced an online system for reporting suspicious activity and worked on improving a national registry of companies.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit pointed to increased compliance activity, including a 79 per cent rise in reporting of suspicious transactions and activity between 2021 and 2022, as proof that the state\u2019s systems are strengthening.\n\nNicholas Cameron, KPMG\u2019s head of forensics in the lower Gulf region, said the UAE had made \u201cmassive progress\u201d, adding that \u201cquite rigorous inspections\u201d were now being carried out across financial institutions.\n\nHowever, anti-corruption campaigners argue that the FATF\u2019s move has come too soon and that the international community should keep pressuring the UAE to continue its reforms.\n\nBerlin-headquartered Transparency International said in a letter to FATF that the UAE had more to prove, citing allegations that at least three Russian politicians hit with sanctions by Australia, New Zealand, France and Switzerland over Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine still owned properties in Dubai.\n\nAn influx of wealthy Russians to the UAE after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has been a point of concern for western countries trying to use financial sanctions to starve the Kremlin\u2019s war machine and prevent oligarchs from laundering money abroad.\n\nMa\u00edra Martini, head of policy and advocacy at Transparency International, said two years was insufficient time to see the UAE\u2019s changes in action. \u201cIt is definitely too early to tell whether there is an appetite to really go after those enabling corruption and those hiding in the UAE and those abusing the loopholes and secrecy,\u201d Martini said.\n\nThe risk of criminals using the UAE to launder ill-gotten cash remains, experts say.\n\n\u201cGetting out of the grey list is just one tiny step,\u201d said Shah. \u201cIt\u2019s more about the UAE continuing to have this position, to keep fighting emerging risks as a transient economy, as an important economic centre of the world.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/592b15b3-16d3-44e4-9605-54f027f430c1"}}, {"id": "d641f0c9-1c8a-49cf-b21a-760aec294ecb", "event_name": "Barclay family pledges UK businesses for Abu Dhabi loans in Telegraph bid", "blurb": "Filings show that companies including the Very Group have new charges linked to an IMI deal ", "date": "2024-02-2000:00:00.0", "body": "The Barclay family has pledged its remaining primary UK businesses as security to loans provided by IMI, the Abu Dhabi investment fund, as part of a deal to buy the Telegraph, according to filings.\n\nAt least half a dozen companies within the Barclay family empire \u2014 including the Very Group, an online retailer and financial services company \u2014 show new charges linked to the IMI loan agreement, filings at Companies House, the UK\u2019s corporate registry, disclose. The charges have been entered against a range of holding companies related to the retail group.\n\nLloyds Banking Group pushed the Telegraph newspaper group into administration last year over unpaid debts by the Barclays of about \u00a31.1bn, leaving the UK bank to conduct a sale of the right-leaning broadsheet that had been owned by the family since 2004.\n\nRedBird IMI, the vehicle backed by IMI, short-circuited this sales process by offering the family money to pay the Lloyds loan back in full. About half of this money was through a convertible loan for the national newspaper, and half in a loan of similar size to the family from IMI relating to other parts of the Barclay family business empire.\n\nDebt experts have questioned what collateral would be used to secure the IMI loan, with a complicated financing structure at the Very Group that includes securitised bonds, as well as a \u00a3200mn loan from Carlyle, the private equity group, that was used to pay off debt owed to Greensill Capital in 2021.\n\nOne person close to the process confirmed that the security charges were linked to the IMI loan, giving the Abu Dhabi investor the right to take control of parts of the family business in the event of a default. Parts of the group have also been used as collateral for the Carlyle loan.\u00a0The family and RedBird IMI declined to comment.\n\nThe move comes as the Barclay family have scrambled to sell off assets to raise cash, including the Spectator magazine\u2019s headquarters in Westminster, and Yodel, the parcel delivery group.\n\nThe family still technically own the Telegraph after repaying the Lloyds loan, although they cannot exert any influence over the company given the convertible loan agreement that has left RedBird IMI in effective control of the newspaper.\n\nThe Telegraph deal is being held up after a second regulatory investigation on public interest grounds by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority was launched by culture secretary Lucy Frazer.\n\nThe findings of these investigations are due about early March.

His decision to return reflects hopes among Israeli businesspeople that the US-brokered normalisation with the UAE and three other Arab states \u2014 which allows them to openly seek deals in the Middle East \u2014 can withstand the fury and anguish created by Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.\n\n\u201cThe peace survived, the interest survived, the friendships survived,\u201d said Daniel, adding that while it was \u201cawkward\u201d with Emirati friends at the start, \u201cvery quickly it was like, \u2018it\u2019s got nothing to do with us\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe UAE, like all other Arab states, has condemned the devastation wrought by Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza, which has enraged Emiratis and a large part of the majority expatriate population.\n\nBut anger and hurt have largely been contained to private conversations in the autocratic state, where protests are prohibited. This has led to an absence of the kind of large-scale demonstrations in support of the Palestinians seen across the region and other parts of the world. The authorities have also warned against overt displays of Palestinian solidarity.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s leaders have stated their commitment to the deal with Israel known as the Abraham Accords, despite their concerns about Israel\u2019s Gaza offensive.\n\n\u201cThe UAE has taken a strategic decision, and strategic decisions are long-term,\u201d presidential foreign affairs adviser Anwar Gargash told a conference in Dubai last month.\n\nThe UAE has long been unhappy with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right government. But it considers its decision to become the third Arab state to normalise ties with Israel as vital to its interests, both in terms of security and its economic ambitions.\n\nThe UAE needed to keep \u201ccommunication, intelligence and diplomacy\u201d channels open and see if it \u201ccan put them to use\u201d, said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati analyst. \u201cWe knew there would be ups and downs.\u201d\n\nUnlike the \u201ccold peace\u201d that Egypt and Jordan agreed with Israel, the UAE \u2014 which never fought a war with the Jewish state \u2014 embraced the relationship and pushed for greater economic ties, with a particular desire to tap Israeli technology. And with the UAE and Israel sharing a foe in Iran, the accord also enabled Abu Dhabi to overtly develop intelligence sharing and security co-operation.\n\nMost of the new business that followed the accord was conducted with Emirati state-affiliated entities, particularly those in Abu Dhabi, the oil-rich capital that drove the normalisation deal.\n\nEven before the war, tapping private UAE family offices was harder than expected for Israeli entrepreneurs, who wanted to use the Abraham Accords to gain a regional foothold and access to deep-pocketed Gulf investors.\n\nThere was an idea that \u201cIsraeli entrepreneurs would come over, raise a lot of capital and come back\u201d, said Elie Wurtman, co-founder of Jerusalem-based PICO Venture Partners. But \u201cthat is not the way business gets done there\u201d.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has now chilled nascent prospects of Emirati private businesses doing deals with Israeli companies because of the simmering fury among merchant families \u2014 many of whom were already wary of dealing with Israelis \u2014 over the destruction in Gaza.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s business or socially, everyone who is here will think twice,\u201d said an Emirati executive. \u201cIf I had business with an Israel company, I would stop that right now,\u201d he added. \u201cEmotions are very high.\u201d\n\nThe most significant deals have involved Abu Dhabi\u2019s state-affiliated companies. G42, Abu Dhabi\u2019s artificial intelligence company chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE\u2019s powerful national security adviser, was the first Emirati business to open an office in Israel. Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala has invested $1bn in an Israeli gasfield and $100mn in Israeli venture capital and start-ups.\n\nAnd even if some business may have slowed, there are signs that in other areas it is moving ahead.\n\nIsrael-based senior researcher Yoelle Maarek said last month that she was moving ahead with opening a Haifa branch of Abu Dhabi\u2019s Technology Innovation Institute, renowned for its open-source large language model Falcon. TII said it had established itself in Israel early last year, and that Maarek \u201cwas in a recruitment process with us since late summer of 2023\u201d \u2014 prior to the start of the war \u2014 and has now been \u201conboarded\u201d.\n\nThe Gulf state\u2019s airlines have continued services to Tel Aviv even as other carriers cancelled flights, underscoring the interest in maintaining the relationship with Israel.\n\nFor many Israelis doing business in the Emirates, the Israel-Hamas war has sharpened the need for friends in a hostile region.\n\n\u201cSince October 7, perhaps the Abrahamic Accords is no longer in its honeymoon phase \u2014 but it\u2019s still our future,\u201d said Noa Gastfreund, co-founder of the Israeli-Emirati business forum UAE-IL Tech zone. The group is being rebranded as simply Tech Zone \u201cin light of the sensitivities and need for wider regional collaborations\u201d.\n\nArik Shtilman, chief executive officer of the Israeli-founded financial technology company Rapyd, which has about 100 employees in the UAE, said the war\u2019s impact on his business was \u201cliterally nonexistent\u201d.\n\n\u201cEverything is business as usual\u201d in the UAE, he said, adding that there has been a greater change in Europe where it has become more challenging to sign on new clients.\n\nThe bilateral flow of goods between Israel and the UAE, excluding software, topped $2bn from January to August 2023, according to Israel\u2019s ambassador in Abu Dhabi.

She had asked the regulator to report on whether the deal could raise public interest concerns in relation to the need for accurate presentation of news and the need for free expression of opinion, given the risk of influence by Abu Dhabi over the newspaper.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Ofcom chief executive Melanie Dawes said that it would report \u201cimminently\u201d.

Other legal undertakings to the government have promised to guarantee IMI\u2019s status as a passive investor, with no role in operational or editorial matters.\n\nIn a separate letter to RedBird IMI, the government said it remained \u201cconcerned about the potential influence of International Media Investments over TMG which could affect the free expression of opinion and accurate presentation of news in the newspapers\u201d.\n\nThe letter continued that there were \u201ccertain reserved matters where IMI consent will still be required under the partnership agreement\u201d.\n\nAnalysts predict that Frazer will probably refer the deal to the CMA for a more in-depth probe, owing to concerns over press freedom from the takeover of a national newspaper by an investment group backed by Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe move would be a politically safe option, according to people close to the transaction, given it would delay a concrete decision for some months and provide extra evidence for a move either to rubber-stamp the deal or block it on public interest grounds.\n\n\n\n", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/281d151f-1e7a-45e4-b6c4-be474b936e4b"}}, {"id": "9af44538-9c35-4be8-b78a-a9d364594583", "event_name": "UAE denies sending weapons to paramilitary group in Sudan war", "blurb": "Leaked UN report outlined \u2018credible\u2019 evidence that the Gulf state was delivered arms and fuelling the conflict", "date": "2024-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "The United Arab Emirates has denied arming the paramilitary group fighting a war with Sudan\u2019s armed forces, after a leaked UN document found \u201ccredible\u201d evidence that it was sending weapons to the Rapid Support Forces.\n\nThe report, compiled by experts for the UN Security Council and seen by the Financial Times but not yet made public, said several shipments of weapons and ammunition shipments were unloaded each week from cargo planes at an airport in Chad, and handed to the RSF at the Sudanese border.\n\nBut the UAE strongly denied arming any group in Sudan, telling the UN panel that these flights carried humanitarian aid, including for a hospital it had set up.\n\nThe Gulf state \u201cdoes not take sides in the current conflict\u201d, a UAE official told the FT, adding that the country had \u201cconsistently called for de-escalation, a sustainable ceasefire and the initiation of diplomatic dialogue\u201d in Sudan.\n\nDespite the UAE denial, some analysts believe its alleged backing has been crucial in strengthening the RSF. \u201cIf the UAE withdraws its support and cuts ties with the RSF today there\u2019s an 80 per cent chance the war might end tomorrow,\u201d said Hamid Khalafallah, a Sudan expert and PhD researcher at the UK\u2019s University of Manchester.\n\nThe RSF, led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemeti, have been fighting the Sudanese armed forces for control of the country since April. Government forces are led by the country\u2019s de facto president and army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.\n\nThe fighting has killed more than 13,000 people, forced about 7.6mn to flee and left almost 25mn \u2014 more than half of the country\u2019s population \u2014 needing humanitarian aid, according to the UN\u2019s humanitarian affairs agency.\n\nHemeti\u2019s militia now controls most of the western Sudanese Darfur region, its historic power base, and parts of the capital Khartoum.

The Sudanese armed forces also committed war crimes, it added, for instance by using aerial bombing and heavy shelling in urban areas.\n\nHemeti\u2019s militia exploited the country\u2019s natural resources to fund the war, according to the UN report. It said the paramilitary group invested proceeds from Sudan\u2019s gold trade \u2014 most of which it controlled prior to the war \u2014 into several industries, which enabled it to \u201cacquire weapons, pay salaries, fund media campaigns, lobbying, and buy support of other political and armed groups\u201d.\n\nSix of the entities that the RSF and SAF have allegedly used to maintain their war efforts had sanctions imposed this week by the EU. Two of the companies linked to the RSF had UAE addresses, and the EU alleged that one \u2014 Al Junaid Multi Activities Co Ltd \u2014 acted as a conduit for arms from the UAE.\n\n\u201cThe RSF is also using Al Junaid\u2019s gold production and exports to secure military support from the UAE, to which most of Sudan\u2019s gold production is smuggled,\u201d the EU regulation stated. The FT could not reach Al Junaid for comment.\n\nThe conflict has drawn in several other countries vying for influence in strategically placed Sudan, which borders the Red Sea and straddles the Middle East and Africa.\n\nAside from the UAE, which over the past decade has expanded its influence in the Horn of Africa region and is an ally of Ethiopia, Egypt has supported Sudan\u2019s military, albeit in a minor capacity, analysts say, while Saudi Arabia maintains relations with both warring parties and hosted peace talks in Jeddah.\n\nHowever, various peace talks that have also involved the US have failed to curb the violence, with analysts saying they lacked co-ordination and a clear strategy as well as the backing of several important players.\n\nWith no sign of the fighting abating, there are fears the Sudan war will drag on. As the conflict fragments, there is a risk of new groups forming and a splintering into localised fighting, which could increase the suffering of civilians and make peace talks more difficult.\n\nThis was what happened in the past, Khalafallah said, noting how the RSF was a \u201cmilitia that the military created, empowered and supported, and now it is fighting against the military\u201d.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8e211c5d-0e2e-4e01-b1e6-b13852485b67"}}, {"id": "949ed28a-7285-45be-9ab1-05d584d3dbf0", "event_name": "India equity ETF set to debut on Abu Dhabi bourse", "blurb": "Planned listing of Chimera S&P India Shariah ETF comes as ties deepen between Asia and the Middle East", "date": "2024-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "An exchange traded fund investing solely in Indian equities is set to debut on the Abu Dhabi bourse, suggesting Middle Eastern investors\u2019 strong interest in deploying money to Asia\u2019s second-largest market.\n\nAbu Dhabi-based asset manager Lunate Capital plans to roll out the Chimera S&P India Shariah ETF, which will target large shariah-compliant Indian companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange on January 26.\n\nThe ETF will replicate the performance of the S&P India Shariah Liquid 35/20 Capped Index, which counts 30 of the most liquid Indian companies, including Reliance Industries, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, among its constituents.\n\nLunate\u2019s Chimera S&P India Shariah ETF is open for investor subscription from January 12 to 17.

As the Houthis are giving us occasion to remember, the forum of world economics is the sea. The setting of Davos encourages a very turn-of-the-millennium obsession with ideas, \u201ctrends\u201d and tech over geographic facts. You wouldn\u2019t know from the abstraction of the discourse there how much of modern life still hinges on the safe passage of tangible objects across water (or on the distribution of mineral deposits). It is easier in Dubai to see what makes the world go round because of, not despite, its de-intellectualisation of things.\n\nBut that\u2019s the least of it. When the world was American-led, market-based and ever more democratic, Davos was a useful distillation of it. Dubai, where the US is one influence among several, capital more state-directed and political values negotiable, is now a more faithful portrait of the world. When a sanctioned Russian moves from Knightsbridge to Palm Jumeirah, or a sovereign fund rather than a private one acquires a foreign asset, globalisation is going on \u2014 just not on western terms.\n\nI doubt there will be a \u201ccapital of the world\u201d again. Power is too diffused. But the trend of the world is best seen in Dubai. (Bangkok is a decent vantage point too.) You can\u2019t guess from the faces and voices of shoppers in Dubai Mall which have been the best-off nations since 1945, or even if Europe is better-off than India. Excluding the airport, I have overheard one American all week. (\u201cThis place is crazy\u201d, she said of the Mall, twice over, and not without insight.) If Davos Man and Woman were rich people from rich countries, their Dubai equivalents are rich people from middle-income countries that were poor within their parents\u2019 lifetimes.\n\nTo be clear, I preferred the Davos world. I am becoming more, not less, of an Anglo-liberal absolutist with age. But if the point is to have some notion of where things are going, then passing through Dubai once in a while, as a sort of pulse-check, is shrewd. The alternative? The untenable conceit that a globalist is someone who knows London and Paris.\n\nThis year is the 100th anniversary of Thomas Mann\u2019s The Magic Mountain. Set in a Davos sanatorium, the book re-creates the world before the first world war on a miniature scale. One patient represents liberal humanism, one conservative reaction, another decadence, and so on. In the final scene, when the protagonist comes down from the mountain to fight, the reader knows that an inferno is due for that entire civilisation.\n\nA century on, Davos is again infused with a sense of chronic or even terminal illness. A once-invincible order seems to be going to seed. Dubai is worth a visit because it reveals this fear to be at least half-right. Yes, the economic centre of the world\u00a0(people have tried to calculate its exact location over time) is moving east. The fruits of that new wealth have to be seen up close.\n\nAt the same time, look how much still rests on western elements. There is the US naval presence up in Bahrain. There is the common law in the Dubai International Finance Centre. What price Jebel Ali Port if America were to leave the guarding of shipping lanes to its less liberal rivals? Which foreign investors would trust the enforcement of their contracts to whimsical diktat rather than case precedent?\n\nThere is a lot of glee out there at the fading of Davos World. That doesn\u2019t mean there is a model to replace it. The cleverness of Dubai is in not choosing. This mental bifurcation extends to the tolerant-but-also-strict moral codes, the western-but-also-not architecture, and the ambiguous geopolitical orientation of the United Arab Emirates. I can never decide if this is the least subtle place on Earth, or the most.\n\njanan.ganesh@ft.com\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow @FTWeekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life & Art wherever you listen", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9e6a380f-4377-4cfa-aa0d-c5ae5e9cc483"}}, {"id": "54ab0da0-1edd-4228-89d7-09a04a067838", "event_name": "The world\u2019s cities are not ready for climate change", "blurb": "Urban areas must rapidly become more resilient to rising temperatures", "date": "2024-01-1800:00:00.0", "body": "Think of climate change, and the mind instantly tends to go to melting ice caps, arid plains, forest fires and sinking tropical islands. But the impact of rising temperatures will not only be felt in the hinterlands. A report, commissioned by London\u2019s mayor, this week highlighted the possibility of \u201cmore intense and frequent heatwaves, more intense rainfall, flash flooding and sea level rise\u201d in the British capital. It is a reminder that cities across the world \u2014 where over 80 per cent of global gross domestic product and the majority of the planet\u2019s population live \u2014 are also under significant threat.\n\nMajor urban ports \u2014 including those on America\u2019s eastern and western coastlines \u2014 risk becoming increasingly swamped in the coming decades. The 2050 Climate Change City Index, produced by Nestpick, a rentals platform, places a range of high and low-income cities at risk of rising sea-level damage. This includes Bangkok in top place, where the OECD has projected over 5mn of its inhabitants could be exposed to flooding by the 2070s. Amsterdam, Shenzhen and Dubai also rank in the top 10.\n\nIt is not only coastal cities that face challenges. Many riverside cities including Paris, Cairo and New Delhi are at risk of flooding too, while those farther from flowing water are under threat from drought, such as Phoenix, Bras\u00edlia and Mexico City. The number of cities exposed to extreme heat is expected to almost triple by 2030. Extreme weather events are also expected to become more intense and frequent.\n\nThe human and economic costs could be enormous. In young and fast-growing African and Asian countries, urbanisation is set to continue unabated. This will put millions more impoverished city dwellers directly at risk of flooding, heat illnesses and famine. The urban heat island effect \u2014 where cities tend to be hotter than rural areas due to heat trapping and emissions from buildings \u2014 could also be exacerbated as populations and economic activity swells. Trading floors, skyscrapers and factories in urban centres risk becoming uninhabitable. According to C40, a network of city mayors, climate-related flooding and drought could cost the world\u2019s major cities $194bn annually.\n\nWith the Paris Climate Agreement\u2019s goal to limit global warming to 1.5C or to well below 2C potentially slipping out of reach, cities need to make a step-change in their adaptation and resilience efforts. Some are already acting. At the extreme end, the Indonesian government plans to abandon its capital, Jakarta, 40 per cent of which now lies below sea level, for a new capital city over 1,000km away. Others have begun by greening cities with parks and gardens, which help to cool urban space and reduce flood risk.\n\nBut too many cities are taking inadequate action. The report on London stated the capital was \u201cunderprepared\u201d for the effects of climate change. Greening and retrofitting often aged infrastructure in dense urban spaces is complicated, disruptive and expensive. To navigate this, more cities must first create adaptation strategies. Planning rules may need reform and local areas will also need the powers and resources to adapt their cities. Investment in flood defences, land engineering solutions and green technology also needs to be ramped up. Regional and multilateral lenders can provide financial support for cities in developing countries.\n\nThere are political challenges too. Boosting cities\u2019 resilience could be seen as shifting funds from needy regions to wealthier urbanites. Big populations in urban areas may also vote down necessary, but ugly, infrastructure adaptations. It is essential nonetheless that national and local governments find a way through the myriad difficulties. Otherwise their urban economic powerhouses will come under increasing strain, multiplying their problems in the process.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ddcb224f-2f1e-45ad-8fac-159d9c951074"}}, {"id": "22d1d20c-6c5b-4d6c-b1ef-4f97c54d1962", "event_name": "Alvarez & Marsal restructuring executive detained in UAE", "blurb": "Adviser was working on the overhaul of a Nasdaq-listed group that US regulators charged with fraud ", "date": "2024-01-1500:00:00.0", "body": "An executive from consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal was detained in the United Arab Emirates while working to overhaul a Nasdaq-listed company that US authorities charged with fraud last month, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nGuy Wall, the managing director of A&M\u2019s restructuring practice in Dubai, last month became a director of Brooge Energy Limited, a UAE oil storage company that had been plagued by financial reporting failings since listing in New York in 2019.\n\nWall and a colleague became directors after A&M was appointed in November by a Cayman Islands court to oversee the liquidation of BPGIC Holdings, the holding company that is the majority owner of Brooge.\n\nThe court appointed A&M as liquidators following a successful legal claim over unpaid debts from Bahrain-based investment firm Asma Capital.\n\nWall was detained this month by authorities in the UAE, the people said, as he was in the process of working out a plan to stabilise Brooge after the fraud charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThey added that Wall was held in prison in Fujairah, the emirate where Brooge\u2019s oil storage tankers are based, before being released.

A businessman, Salman Dawood Salman al-Ameri, was the majority shareholder in BPGIC Holdings.\n\nTheir stakes were set in effect to be stripped from them, however, when Wall and fellow A&M executive Alexander Lawson were appointed as liquidators of BPGIC Holdings.\n\nA&M has significantly expanded its international operations in recent years, including in the Middle East, competing with global\u00a0advisory firms such as the Big Four professional services groups. It employs about 8,500 people globally.\n\nThe SEC on December 22 charged Brooge and two of its former executives with fraud after it found that the company had \u201ccreated false invoices to support inflating revenues from its oil facilities in Fujairah, UAE by over $70mn over three years\u201d.\n\nBrooge, which did not admit or deny the SEC\u2019s charges, agreed to pay a $5mn penalty.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s probe focused on a related party called Al Brooge International Advisory (BIA), which it said \u201chad no meaningful business operations aside from participating in the misstatements of revenues associated with [Brooge Energy]\u201d.\n\nBoth EY and PwC have resigned as auditors of Brooge since the company went public. PwC quit in December 2022, citing \u201cdisagreements\u201d on matters of accounting with the company.\n\nBrooge replaced PwC with UAE-based accountancy firm Affiniax AAS Auditors.

Asma is backed by Gulf sovereign entities such as Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, the Islamic Development Bank and Bahrain\u2019s finance ministry.\n\nBPGIC Holdings borrowed $75mn from Asma\u2019s fund in 2019, but never paid any interest on the debt, according to Cayman Island court filings related to its insolvency, racking up more than $30mn of unpaid interest.\n\nBPGIC Holdings owns more than 85 per cent of Brooge Energy\u2019s listed shares. The holding company was in turn owned by Salman Dawood Salman al-Ameri and Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\nBrooge was part of a wave of foreign groups that seized on the US boom for special acquisition companies to list their shares in New York.\n\nBrooge last week announced that two restructuring advisers from Alvarez & Marsal had been appointed to its board as a result of BPGIC Holdings being placed into liquidation. Alexander Lawson and Guy Wall, the Alvarez & Marsal partners acting as official liquidators, said that the process would \u201chave no adverse impact on the company\u2019s performance\u201d and that Brooge has a \u201csolid business foundation and state-of-the-art facilities\u201d.\n\nBrooge declined to comment.

While BIA had been a related party, Brooge said that one of its shareholders was planning to divest her stake in the company, making it independent.\n\nEY resigned as Brooge\u2019s auditor in 2020 and was replaced by PwC.

The first climate COP was held in Berlin in 1995 with just under 4,000 delegates.\n\nThe FT analysis of the COP 28 figures, collated by the UN on the closing day of the summit held at Expo City, includes only those who had activated their badges for the so-called blue zone where the formal business is conducted.\n\nThe 65,000-plus number of core participants does not include technical and support staff of almost 13,500, which would bring the physical presence to near 80,000 on site.\n\nEarly registrations closed at the end of October and initial figures of more than 100,000 were recorded, but about one-third of those indicating their interest did not ultimately attend.\n\nThe largest group of delegates plus observers are those who have an active part in the negotiations and represent nation states, and the EU bloc. This group numbered more than 40,000, or almost double the previous figures, including more than 22,000 \u201coverflow\u201d badges issued.\n\nThe UAE presidency hosting the summit invited more than 9,000 to the formal business area in the blue zone, including about 5,000 guests outside of its own extended delegation, based on Financial Times analysis of a provisional UN list of attendees.\n\nThe UAE guest list included chief executives and private sector lobbyists, led by energy industry executives, such as ExxonMobil boss Darren Woods, Oxy CEO Vicki Hollub, ENI head Claudio Descalzi and German energy group RWE\u2019s chief, Markus Krebber.\n\nThe UAE also brought a sizeable contingent of 17 Abu Dhabi National Oil Company staff, where COP28 president Sultan al-Jaber is chief executive.

The two-week COP28 conference in Dubai was no exception.\n\nIt ran nearly 24 hours over schedule and headlines centred on 34 agonisingly crafted words in the final text that called on countries to shift away from fossil fuels in energy systems.\n\nMarkets do not move and change does not magically happen with such words, even though these were the first of their kind in nearly 30 years of COPs. The power of these meetings lies instead in their ability to normalise the once unthinkable, which is why exhausted delegates haggle so fiercely over a final outcome.\n\nBut COPs are changing too. Behind the fraught diplomatic negotiations, countries and companies have begun to forge less visible agreements to take more immediate and concrete climate action that could cut demand for fossil fuels and eliminate potent emissions.\n\nThree pledges made at COP28 are worth looking at in detail.\n\nWhile oil and gas companies have not yet committed to producing less fossil fuels, their pledge to cut emissions from their own operations is noteworthy.\n\nSaudi Aramco, ExxonMobil and BP were among 50 of the world\u2019s top fossil fuel producers to sign the \u201coil and gas decarbonisation charter\u201d, a voluntary agreement to stop routine flaring of excess gas by 2030 and eliminate almost all leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.\n\nMost of the initial signatories were national oil companies, such as Saudi Aramco and Brazil\u2019s Petrobras, which account for more than half of global production but typically face less pressure to decarbonise than their publicly traded counterparts.\n\nThe one thing they all have in common is methane, the odourless gas produced by virtually every oil and gas project worldwide. When it is not cost effective to capture it, companies often release methane into the atmosphere via venting or burn it through flaring, which converts it into carbon dioxide.\n\nThe gas also leaks into the atmosphere from facilities via innumerable small, undetected or unreported leaks in pipelines or other equipment, or through large-scale releases called \u201csuper-emitter\u201d events.\n\nScientists say methane has been responsible for up to 30 per cent of global warming since the industrial era began, so the Dubai charter offers a win for the climate, even if the 50 signatories account for less than a third of the industry\u2019s total operational emissions.\n\nSo can the charter\u2019s aims be met? \u201cIt\u2019ll be different for different companies,\u201d says Adam Pollard of the Wood Mackenzie research firm.\n\nSome of the biggest oil companies have already promised zero routine flaring and near-zero methane, he says, and a number have shown that big progress can be made on the latter. \u201cWith ongoing monitoring, detection and mitigation, near-zero methane feels quite achievable,\u201d he says.\n\nBut zero routine flaring may be trickier. In an ideal world, excess gas would be piped off and sold for extra revenue. But that can be hard in offshore sites, where most flaring happens, because it\u2019s costly to build the necessary gas export facilities.\n\nCompanies will have to assess the future of these sites, says Atul Arya, chief energy strategist at S&P Global Commodity Insights. \u201cThey may decide that they have to shut some production because that\u2019s the most cost effective answer to flaring.\u201d\n\nGovernment regulation will also dictate the charter\u2019s success. Tough new US and EU methane regulations should ensure that companies operating in these jurisdictions live up to their charter pledges, says Kevin Book, managing director of Clearview Energy Partners, a Washington consultancy.\n\nBut for companies operating elsewhere, it will depend on their willingness to invest in the equipment needed to detect and quantify leaks, and monitoring by outside agencies.\n\nAny company trying to dodge its methane pledges faces censure, thanks to more widely available satellite detection.\n\nNew tracing and tracking technologies are making it much easier for the UN and NGOs to pinpoint methane leaks and carbon dioxide footprints around the clock. \u201cSo you can run but you can\u2019t hide,\u201d US climate envoy, John Kerry, told reporters in Dubai on Wednesday. \u201cPeople are going to be held accountable for what their footprints are and what the progress is.\u201d\n\nA second COP28 commitment could affect demand for fossil fuels by tripling the world\u2019s renewable energy generation capacity to at least 11,000 gigawatts by 2030.\n\nMore than 120 countries signed up to this pledge, which will require a big leap in effort from what has been done before. It took 12 years from 2010 to 2022 to achieve the last tripling of renewable capacity. This one has to be done in the space of eight.\n\nMeeting the goal will be \u201chard, but achievable,\u201d according to analysts at the BloombergNEF research group who have assessed the commitment.\n\nThe good news is that solar and wind are now the cheapest sources of new energy generation in most countries, according to the BloombergNEF, and direct subsidies are no longer the main ingredient needed to accelerate deployment in many places.\n\nThe less good news is that the growth of renewables is being held back by a range of bottlenecks that many authorities are struggling to unblock.\n\nTwo chief culprits: permitting rules that can hold up projects for years, and a lack of the investment needed to allow power grids built for fossil fuels to absorb renewables.\n\nOnly 50 cents is currently spent on transmission and distribution grids globally for every dollar of renewable energy investment, say the BloombergNEF analysts.\n\nAs a result, it can take up to eight years to get a grid connection permit in Europe, meaning a wind farm project proposed in 2023 would not be hooked up in time to meet the COP28 target.\n\nIt is estimated nearly 600GW of renewables were queueing for connection in five European countries at the end of 2022 \u2014 enough to double the region\u2019s capacity.\n\nThe problem is also bad in the US where, despite generous clean energy support in the Inflation Reduction Act, projects that might triple the country\u2019s renewable capacity by 2030 are snarled up in grid queues.\n\nOne country that is expected to reach the 2030 tripling goal is China, already a wind and solar juggernaut, where billions have been invested in ultra high voltage power lines. But that will not be enough on its own.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more worried about what happens in the rest of the world,\u201d says Adair Turner, chair of the Energy Transitions Commission coalition of experts.\n\nThe US government is trying to fix the problem by fast-tracking permits for transmission lines, as are countries elsewhere. But BloombergNEF forecasts suggest that as things stand today, the US, Europe, Japan, India and Indonesia are not on track to meet the 2030 tripling target.\n\nThe third COP28 commitment with implications for hydrocarbons is aimed at boosting energy efficiency.\n\nMore efficient and smart use of energy is widely referred to as the \u201cfirst fuel\u201d in clean energy transitions because it offers some of the quickest and most cost-effective options for cutting emissions, lowering energy bills and bolstering energy security.\n\nThe technology and policies required are already well established, from heat pumps and greener lightbulbs to low-carbon building codes and transport.\n\nElectric cars also matter: these vehicles can convert more than 77 per cent of the electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheels while conventional gasoline vehicles only convert about 12 per cent to 30 per cent of the energy stored in gasoline.\n\nThe countries that signed up to the 2030 renewables pledge agreed to collectively double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements from around 2 per cent to more than 4 per cent every year until 2030.\n\nCan this be done? \u201cIt\u2019s highly ambitious, but achievable,\u201d says James Newcomb, a senior expert at the Rocky Mountain Institute research group that was founded to improve US energy practices.\n\nThe soaring price of energy spurred by the war in Ukraine has seen record global investment in energy efficiency. Even before then, dozens of countries analysed by the International Energy Agency have been able to improve their energy intensity by 4 per cent or more at least one year in the past 10.\n\nBut meeting the COP28 pledge on a sustained basis will require more active policymaking, which could invite political opposition and public backlash. The agency reckons global efficiency rates would be doubled if every government adopted policies that matched:\n\nOn the issue of air-conditioning: in recognition of the growing risk it poses in a warming world, 63 countries also signed a global cooling pledge at COP28. It aims to cut cooling-related emissions across all sectors by at least 68 per cent globally, though not until 2050.\n\nGiven that timeframe, it is no surprise that experts expect this goal to be met. \u201cWe have the solutions,\u201d says J\u00fcrgen Fischer, president of climate solutions at Danish industrial group, Danfoss. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of high energy efficiency, environmentally friendly refrigerants and renewable energy for a decarbonised grid that will get us there. Now governments need to turn words into action by creating plans for implementation.\u201d\n\nMeeting the three big energy pledges on oil and gas emissions, renewables, and energy efficiency will require government action, of course. Yet this will not be enough.\n\nEven if all three commitments are met, the IEA has made the dismal calculation that this would only amount to about 30 per cent of the emissions cuts needed to put the world on track for the Paris agreement goal to limit warming to 1.5C.\n\nIn other words, as with so much else in global climate policy, COP28 has taken an important step forward, but it is still not close to the giant strides the world needs.\n\nLetters in response to this article:\n\nFossil fuel addicts need to check into rehab\u00a0/\u00a0From Professor Hugh Willmott, Professor of Management, Bayes Business School, London EC1, UK\n\nCar\u00adbon pri\u00adcing is a key tool, but not the only one / From Mark Moody-Stu\u00adart, Has\u00adsocks, East Sus\u00adsex, UK", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/af71fc48-b89f-4920-a35b-2867b7adcc0c"}}, {"id": "b66879c0-bbb5-4465-b6fc-a57503e7a1b2", "event_name": "How the COP28 deal was won but the battle for 1.5C may be lost", "blurb": "Fossil fuel economies resist pressure from vulnerable countries needing financial assistance to deal with climate change", "date": "2023-12-1300:00:00.0", "body": "European diplomats fanned out across the expansive grounds of the futuristic conference venue in Dubai on Tuesday in a final push to galvanise support for a global agreement to dump fossil fuels.\n\nThe most intense phase of the talks in the final days of the two-week-long UN COP28 climate summit exposed deep divisions between wealthy and poorer countries over the costs of halting new coal, gas and oil projects.\n\nAlmost 200 countries on Wednesday signed a compromise agreement to transition from fossil fuels that some \u2014 including the group of 39 small island states that were not present for the outcome as they scrambled to gather their response \u2014 accused of not going far enough.\n\nAfter the deal was struck, the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producer expressed an understanding for those countries that are economically reliant on fossil fuel production.\n\n\u201cI would love it if certain countries had come here and signed on the dotted line and said, \u2018we\u2019re finished\u2019,\u201d said John Kerry, the US\u2019s top climate diplomat, referring to fossil fuel production.\n\n\u201cBut no, you know, one minister from one of those countries said, \u2018John, you can\u2019t ask us to commit economic suicide\u2019.\u201d\n\nSultan al-Jaber, president of COP28 and head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, courted dozens of diplomats and ministers overnight on Tuesday to back the compromise deal.\n\nThis included successive meetings with China\u2019s climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, half-brother of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who led the resistance to any suggestion of cuts in fossil fuel production.\n\nThe talks, which pushed the world\u2019s most important climate summit almost 24 hours beyond its deadline, laid bare the financial gulf with the countries suffering disproportionately from climate change.\n\nSmall island nations are on the front line of climate change and argue that high levels of debt and high borrowing costs leave them unable to cope with extreme weather events fuelled by global warming.\n\nMona Ainuu, minister for natural resources from the atoll Niue, broke into tears on Monday night as she told reporters: \u201cWe need help in the Pacific.

This remains far out of reach \u2014 instead emissions are expected to rise another 2 per cent this year.\n\nMany scientists questioned whether it was strong enough to halt greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to limit global temperature rises.\n\nJohan Rockstr\u00f6m, co-director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said the COP28 agreement was a \u201cpivotal landmark\u201d but it \u201cwill not enable the world to hold the 1.5C limit\u201d.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/91941c3e-5016-47dc-8068-3e66f42b6f65"}}, {"id": "f5b4a1fc-8a16-484b-8eb2-9472f8064203", "event_name": "COP28: A deal at last", "blurb": "Some progress, but some glaring gaps", "date": "2023-12-1300:00:00.0", "body": "Hello from Dubai. After two consecutive nights of intense negotiations that ran into the small hours, COP28 has ended in a deal.\n\nThe \u201cglobal stocktake\u201d agreed here has broken with the shameful inability of previous UN climate conferences to state openly the need to move away from fossil fuels. COP president Sultan al-Jaber \u2014 who has received huge criticism over his conflicts of interest as a major oil company chief executive \u2014 deserves credit for persuading big oil producers, notably Saudi Arabia to support this deal.\n\nYet this agreement leaves a vast amount of work to be done. And to some eyes, this COP has been yet another failure, given that we still don\u2019t have a clear path to the end of fossil fuel usage.\n\nThat message was given voice at the closing plenary by Anne Rasmussen, lead negotiator for Samoa, who complained that she and other small island state representatives were still in discussion outside the hall when the agreement was approved. \u201cWe see a litany of loopholes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot afford to return to our islands with the message that this process has failed us.\u201d \u2014 Simon Mundy\n\nTo many observers of COP28, saying that we need to move away from fossil fuels to tackle climate change will seem like a statement of the bleeding obvious. It\u2019s a fair point, which is why the failure to say this in the 27 previous COPs was so egregious \u2014 and why the fossil fuel language in this text is significant.\n\nMany countries, including the EU and the Alliance of Small Island States, had pushed at COP28 for a commitment to \u201cphase out\u201d fossil fuels. That term didn\u2019t make it into the text. Instead, it called on nations to contribute to:\n\nSome analysts have expressed severe disappointment with this language, saying that unlike \u201cphase out\u201d, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that fossil fuel usage is on the way to zero. Still less does this text give a clear deadline for stopping fossil fuel usage. But \u201ctransitioning away from\u201d still seems a tad stronger than \u201creducing\u201d or \u201cphasing down\u201d, which were other options on offer.\n\nIt\u2019s also notable that this clause talks about moving away from fossil fuels in energy systems altogether, not just \u201cunabated\u201d usage. The latter phrasing would have implied no need to transition away from fossil fuels, provided you use carbon capture technology.\n\nCarbon capture appears in the very next clause, however, as one of the green technologies that countries are encouraged to \u201caccelerate\u201d \u2014 something that will concern those who worry that it will help prop up the fossil fuel industry.\n\nThe language agreed at COP26 on \u201caccelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power\u201d survives unchanged, despite efforts here to strengthen wording around the most polluting fossil fuel.\n\nAnother clause that has prompted some queasiness is the statement \u201cthat transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition while ensuring energy security\u201d. This is an apparent reference to fossil gas, which is presented by advocates as a less polluting alternative to coal.\n\nThe text introduces its language about energy systems by saying that countries can take into account \u201ctheir different national circumstances, pathways and approaches\u201d \u2014 wording that some governments may use to push for flexibility around their obligations.\n\nAt the plenary discussion where the deal was approved, a succession of developing nations stressed the urgent need for rich countries to provide more support on climate finance.\n\nThe global stocktake had some decent language on the scale of this challenge. It warned of the \u201cgrowing gap\u201d between the finance that developing countries need to fund their climate-related obligations, and the support that they have so far secured. Their adaptation finance needs are estimated at $215bn-$387bn a year this decade, it warned.\n\nYet even as it acknowledged that adaptation finance \u201cwill have to be significantly scaled up\u201d beyond the doubling (from 2019 levels, by 2025) that has already been agreed, the text was short on detail of how this will be achieved.\n\nSimilarly, while the text welcomed the first funding provided for the new climate loss and damage fund, these commitments \u2014 amounting to less than $1bn \u2014 amount to \u201can initial downpayment\u201d, as Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, told reporters today.\n\nA massive increase in funding for low-carbon energy is also needed. One of the key wins for COP28 president Sultan al-Jaber was the agreement here to triple renewable energy capacity globally, and double the average rate of energy efficiency improvements, by 2030.\n\nThe text made clear that climate finance \u2014 both to restrain climate change, and to respond to its impacts \u2014 will \u201cneed to increase manyfold\u201d.\n\nIt noted that the capital is there to close the investment gap, but noted \u201cbarriers to redirecting capital to climate action\u201d. Interestingly, it named taxation as one of the \u201cnew and innovative sources of finance\u201d for governments to explore \u2014 a promising area, as we highlighted last week.\n\nFilling in these climate finance gaps will be at the top of the agenda at next year\u2019s COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan. The preparations for that event should begin today.

It is better than feared but less than needed. It bows too much to the forces of international diplomacy, and too little to the immovable realities of science. Yet the COP28 climate conference in Dubai has delivered a historic and unmistakable message that the global energy system must move away from the use of coal, oil and gas.\n\nThis follows a two-week meeting in which the fundamental clash between the need for climate action and the economic reliance on fossil fuels has been laid bare to an extent rarely seen. The final agreement calls on countries to shift away from fossil fuel use for energy in order to reach net zero emissions by 2050. After nearly 30 years of UN climate COPs, this is the first to specify the need for such a decline in the use of all fossil fuels, by far the biggest contributor to global warming.\n\nThe meeting of almost every country in the world also agreed that this shift should be accelerated \u201cin this critical decade\u201d, \u201cin keeping with the science\u201d. And it recognised that limiting global warming to 1.5C required emissions almost to halve by 2030.\n\nThis message would nonetheless have been far sharper had the final agreement spelt out firm deadlines for when fossil fuel use should peak and decline this decade. Many countries had sought such an outcome in Dubai, not least those most vulnerable to climate change. The stakes are especially high when the US could soon be led again by a president who just a few years ago pulled the country out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\n\nAs part of the Paris accord, COP28 had to come up with a deal that guided countries\u2019 future plans to meet the goal of limiting warming to 1.5C. This guidance is now more muted than many nations would have liked. But as John Kerry, the US climate envoy, told the conference on Wednesday: \u201cWe know this was a compromise between many parties.\u201d Such compromises have long prevailed in UN-sponsored climate meetings, where decisions are made by consensus. Calls for future COPs to make decisions by a majority vote will be strengthened by this meeting.\n\nThe dynamics of this summit were rocked by the leak of a letter from the head of Opec to oil-producing nations that openly urged them to \u201creject any test or formula that targets energy, ie fossil fuels, rather than emissions\u201d. The oil cartel did not in the end get its way, though nor did nations seeking a stronger agreement.\n\nOpec\u2019s intervention underlines an often overlooked reality of climate COPs. These meetings are frequently dismissed as hot air, and they cannot instantly change anything on the ground. But they normalise ideas and measures once seen as too radical to be globally agreed, such as the need to shift away from fossil fuels \u2014 which Opec well understands.\n\nAgainst somewhat pessimistic expectations, moreover, the COP hosts United Arab Emirates, and its president Sultan al-Jaber \u2014 who heads the national company Adnoc \u2014 presided over a conference that produced some important measures even beyond the headline call on fossil fuels. In a rare move, national oil companies agreed to cut their emissions, though not their production levels. Countries agreed to triple renewable energy capacity and double global energy efficiency rates by 2030.\n\nA long-sought climate loss and damage fund was approved as wealthy countries committed more than $400mn on day one in a move that has allowed the fund to get up and running. A $30bn UAE commitment for a separate climate finance fund that aims to mobilise $250bn in green investments by 2030 is also positive, as are the billions of dollars in climate finance pledges from the public and private sector. But the global energy transition requires those billions to become trillions \u2014 so it was welcome, too, to see multilateral development banks offer new plans to scale up climate finance.\n\nUltimately, individual governments, banks, investors and companies will decide whether all these goals are met. COP28 missed the chance to offer firmer signposts on the speed and scale of global climate action. But it still marks a step forward \u2014 rather than the retreat that many had feared.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/21852bf3-80e6-46f7-ad06-c94d89bc90de"}}, {"id": "2303de8d-9137-4168-87de-4ea06fd462c5", "event_name": "US hits Turkish and Chinese companies over Russia trade", "blurb": "Latest sanctions package aims to stem flow of sensitive war-related goods to Moscow ", "date": "2023-12-1200:00:00.0", "body": "The US has hit companies in Turkey, the UAE and China with sanctions as part of a sweeping effort to stop the Russian defence industry easily obtaining sensitive technologies for Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nMore than 250 entities were covered by the measures, which also reached deep into Russia\u2019s war economy, even targeting a provincial bakery refitted to make drones.\n\nThe latest US package is timed to coincide with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s visit to Washington this week, a show of support for Kyiv even amid political roadblocks that have raised doubts about future military aid.\n\nThe sanctions target military contractors and civilian companies that have turned to supporting Russia\u2019s war effort, leading to increasing confidence from the Kremlin that it can bolster its arsenal while western resolve to support Ukraine crumbles.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to use the tools at our disposal to promote accountability for Russia\u2019s crimes in Ukraine and those who finance and support Russia\u2019s war machine,\u201d said US secretary of state Antony Blinken.\n\nUkraine\u2019s allies are particularly concerned about Russia using countries such as Turkey, the UAE and China either as sources or conduits for high-end electronics and high-precision goods that Moscow\u2019s war effort is unable to produce domestically.\n\nThe US measures also target companies that have helped transfer munitions and military equipment from North Korea to bolster Russia\u2019s defence stocks.\n\nNorth Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has swung to supporting Moscow after meeting Putin in September, supplying the Russian military with much-needed artillery rounds.\n\nBut the US\u2019s main focus is on industrial companies in Russia, many of which are civilian companies that have switched to producing defence equipment under Putin\u2019s drive to put the economy on a war footing.\n\nThe continued supplies of technologies from advanced microchips to ball bearings have helped keep artillery, drones and missiles rolling off the production lines at Russian factories.

He added that G42 had decided to pull back from its China relationships to appease its US corporate partners and to ensure it complied with Washington\u2019s rules on exports of advanced chips.\n\n\u201cThe impression we are getting from [the] US government and US partners is, we need to be very cautious,\u201d Xiao said.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn order for us to further our relationship \u2014 which we cherish \u2014 with our US partners, we simply cannot do much more with [previous] Chinese partners.\u201d\n\nG42 declined to comment on recent reporting about its links to Chinese groups. It said it had been \u201cat the forefront of technological advancements\u201d and had made an \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d contribution to work on AI governance, ethics and regulation.\n\nHowever, Xiao, who was born in China, studied in the US and is now a UAE citizen, added that G42 had never had \u201cdeep AI research relationships\u201d with Chinese partners \u201cbecause, frankly speaking, they\u2019re not leaders in this domain\u201d.\n\nThe decision by G42 to cut some ties to China shows how Gulf countries with ambitious AI agendas have become battlegrounds in the competition between China and the US over the fast-advancing field.In September, G42 and Microsoft announced an expansion of their partnership with a plan to make sovereign cloud offerings available to the UAE, work together on advanced AI capabilities and expand data centre infrastructure in the Gulf state.\n\nThe following month, G42 and OpenAI unveiled an agreement to use the Microsoft-backed start-up\u2019s generative AI models in areas where the Emirati group has expertise, including financial services, energy, healthcare and public services.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI declined to comment.\n\nG42 and its chair, UAE national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, have been crucial to the country\u2019s push to diversify its geopolitical partnerships to secure access to the latest technologies.\n\nHowever, G42 has been caught up in controversies. Reports suggest it has been involved in the development of ToTok, a UAE chat app allegedly used by the government to spy on the users\u2019 phones. G42 did not respond to a request for comment about its alleged part in the creation of ToTok.\n\nThe UAE sees itself as a node within a new multipolar world, where China, India and Russia have emerged as counterpoints to the west\u2019s historic economic dominance. But the global scramble for AI chips, particularly those made by US chipmaker Nvidia, has limited Abu Dhabi\u2019s room to pivot away from Washington\u2019s orbit.\n\nThe UAE chose Huawei to install the first national 5G infrastructure in 2019, despite US objections, citing an unavailability of similar technology from western partners promoted by Washington. Since then, however, state companies have signed further deals with Sweden\u2019s Ericsson as the UAE pursues a policy of diversifying its telecommunications partners.\n\nThe growing row over G42 highlights how it is hard for companies to simply pick the US or China when both have \u201ca lot to offer\u201d on AI, said Nikki Sun, an academy associate in the digital society initiative at the Chatham House think-tank.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unsurprising that G42, as an AI-focused start-up, engages with China, given China\u2019s extensive role in the global AI value chain, from hardware, talent, to end market,\u201d said Sun, who is also a fellow at Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic venture led by former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt. \u201cSevering these connections entirely seems very unlikely.\u201d\n\nG42 insists its \u201cextensive network\u201d of international relationships is \u201cno different\u201d from \u201cany other global technology company, including US companies\u201d.\n\nG42 has partnered with Sinopharm, the drugs company, and BGI, the genomics research group, in relationships that originated during the Covid-19 pandemic. Sinopharm trialled and later manufactured and distributed its Covid vaccine in the UAE, while G42 worked with BGI to build a detection centre for the disease in the country.\n\nWhen US officials have complained about the UAE\u2019s growing ties with Beijing, Emirati officials have replied that Washington\u2019s reluctance to supply cutting-edge technologies gives them no choice but to co-operate with China.\n\nUS reluctance to sell high-tech military equipment to the UAE and Saudi Arabia has allowed China to fill this vacuum and become an increasingly important player in the regional arms market.\n\nAdditional reporting by Richard Waters and George Hammond in San Francisco", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6710c259-0746-4e09-804f-8a48ecf50ba3"}}, {"id": "482a3609-938d-474e-b00b-1fe3f303f587", "event_name": "Vladimir Putin meets leaders of Saudi Arabia and UAE in whistle-stop Gulf tour", "blurb": "Russia\u2019s president holds talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after meeting ruler of United Arab Emirates earlier ", "date": "2023-12-0600:00:00.0", "body": "Vladimir Putin has met the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as part of the first visit by the Russian president to the Gulf region since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago.\n\nThe two-stop tour on Wednesday is seen as Moscow\u2019s attempt to show it can maintain close ties with the Gulf despite western attempts to force the region to comply with restrictions and sanctions against Russia.\n\nPutin enjoys warm relations with both the oil-exporting Gulf states, which have remained neutral over Ukraine since the full invasion of February last year. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have not ratified the statute that governs the International Criminal Court, which has indicted the Russian president for alleged war crimes.\n\nThe Russian leader is also keen to show that his country has not been isolated from the world because of the war, ahead of upcoming presidential elections in 2024.\n\nVideo of the meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, day-to-day leader of Saudi Arabia, published by Russian state media showed Putin describing the talks as \u201cvery timely\u201d.

Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman leader of Chechnya, was also in attendance.\n\nRepresentatives of the most important Russian energy companies also took part in the talks, according to state news agencies.\n\nThe UAE has become the main international hub for Russian businesses and a significant route for circumventing western sanctions. According to Putin, the turnover of goods between Russia and the country rose 68 per cent in 2022. \u201cI believe this year [the growth] will be even greater,\u201d he added.\n\nPrince Mohammed and Sheikh Mohammed have developed personal relationships with Putin and touted themselves as interlocutors between Russia and the west.

The scale is enormous: the negotiations involve potential deals for about a tenth of Liberia\u2019s land mass, a fifth of Zimbabwe\u2019s, and swaths of Kenya, Zambia and Tanzania.\n\nBlue Carbon\u2019s intention is to sell the emission reductions linked to forest conservation in these regions as carbon credits, under an unfinished international accounting framework for carbon markets being designed by the UN. In a market that is being designed for and by governments, Blue Carbon is among the most active private brokers.\n\nClimate negotiators meeting in the United Arab Emirates for the COP28 summit this week have been looking to finalise this framework, with the aim of sounding the starting gun on a new market in carbon credits which would allow countries to shrink their own carbon footprints by buying emission reductions from others.\n\nThe trade is supposed to be simple. The 195 countries that have signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement committed to setting targets for reducing their carbon emissions by 2030. If a country exceeds these or future targets \u2014 for instance through switching to renewables, or reforesting territory that increases carbon stocks \u2014 it can sell those additional emission reductions to another country.\n\nThe UAE, alongside other governments such as Switzerland and South Korea, has been betting that these international carbon markets could be a central pillar in the climate solutions offered to world leaders at COP28.\n\nThe existing international market for carbon credits is worth about $2bn, with roughly four in 10 credits sold based on nature restoration projects. Private buyers, from companies to individuals, can buy offsets for their own emissions to meet their own reduction goals. Brokers similar to Blue Carbon obtain rights to buy and sell credits, taking a cut of their value.\n\nUntil recently, governments had steered clear of buying and selling directly into this market. But as targets to cut national emissions by 2030 speed into sight, importing carbon credits at scale has become increasingly attractive. And as plans for a national scheme have emerged, there has been a new rush for access to resources in countries rich in biodiversity.\n\nSouth Korea, Switzerland, Japan, the UAE and Singapore are among the states to have struck 95 preliminary deals since the start of 2021 to buy future emission reductions from countries including Ghana, Vietnam and Senegal, according to data from MSCI carbon markets.\n\nA carbon credit boom could channel money towards poorer countries with smaller carbon footprints and higher financing needs, to help them address the effects of increasingly extreme weather and temperature changes.\n\nBut the scale and speed of dealmaking between countries over available land have sparked concern about a lack of guardrails around this system.\n\nSeller countries are not being given enough time to develop a natural resource strategy that would promote a fair trade in carbon credits, say community leaders and activists in the countries where Blue Carbon is active.\n\nKey issues include revenue-sharing, land rights and the potential impact on the host countries\u2019 ability to hit its own climate target.\n\n\u201cThe [methods] of exploitation might be new but the consequences are not so different to the last 200 years of land grabs in Liberia,\u201d says David Young, an independent expert on civil society\u2019s role in forest governance in the country. \u201cThe promises to the communities are vague and unpredictable and it\u2019s like logging or mining or palm oil all over again.\u201d\n\nScientists have also warned about the broader risk to the planet of giving big polluters a green light to continue pumping oil and gas based on purchases made from the existing unregulated market for credits.\n\nAnd scientists including Thales West, of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam\u2019s Institute for Environmental Studies, have argued the market is underpinned by tenuous accounting standards, based on scenarios that overestimate both volumes of carbon removed from the atmosphere and the permanence of these removals.\n\n\u201cWe are fooling ourselves when we purchase these offsets,\u201d West has said.\n\nCarbon credits are part of the UAE\u2019s official strategy to cut its national emissions by 2030, alongside other investments including in hydrogen gas and decarbonising steel production.\n\nAfter the country pledged $450mn to help develop African carbon markets in September, Mohamed Ben Salem, who leads on voluntary carbon markets for the UAE\u2019s presidency of the climate conference, announced in October the UAE would like to see a 50-fold increase in the size of this market globally.\n\n\u201cVoluntary carbon markets can drive real, on the ground effective climate action\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009with significant co-benefits to climate, local communities and nature,\u201d he said at a conference in London.\n\nAnd reforestation is likely to be a central part of future carbon markets. A peer-reviewed study published in Nature journal last month estimated that 139 gigatonnes of carbon could be removed from the atmosphere by better protecting existing forested areas where relatively few people live or work.\n\nThis is more than six times the carbon that the UN\u2019s environment programme has said needs to be cut from annual emissions by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nFor Fran\u00e7ois Megret, head of carbon trading at First Abu Dhabi Bank \u2014 which is the UAE\u2019s biggest lender, an official partner of the COP28 summit and a backer of Blue Carbon \u2014 carbon trading between states should start as soon as possible. \u201cWe don\u2019t have 20 years and we don\u2019t want to lose these two years or three years to activate something,\u201d he said at the same conference.\n\nBut some of the earliest deals are being criticised for their lack of transparency and accountability. Liberia, unlike other countries approached by Blue Carbon, does not yet have a law governing the sale and taxation of carbon credits.\n\nA copy of Blue Carbon\u2019s memorandum of understanding with Liberia, dated July and seen by the Financial Times, proposed to give the Dubai-based company exclusive rights to generate and sell carbon credits on about 1mn hectares of Liberian land. It would receive 70 per cent of the value of the credits for the next three decades, and sell these tax-free for a decade.\u00a0The government would receive the other 30 per cent, with some of this going to local communities.\n\nCommunity consultation was due to take place between August and November, according to the document. But Zeleman says that the local leaders he engages with on the land have still not been consulted about the deal.\n\nBlue Carbon denies failing to consult with communities and says it will follow all government \u201claws, rules and regulations\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009once formal binding agreements are entered into\u201d. It adds: \u201cBlue Carbon is mindful of all community and human rights including land rights in Liberia.\u201d\n\nSome activists have heavily criticised the proposed deal. Allowing a foreign company to manage such a big portion of Liberian land would endanger the livelihoods and community land ownership of up to a million people, groups including the Rainforest Foundation UK, Friends of the Earth and Earthsight wrote in a letter earlier this year.\n\nThe government was \u201chanding over decisions about how a substantial part of its carbon emissions for the next 30 years are to be managed [to] a UAE firm that has existed for less than a year, and which has no track record in carbon trading,\u201d they said in the letter.\n\nNo contract with Blue Carbon has yet been signed, says Wilson Tarpeh, head of Liberia\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency, who flew to Dubai over the summer to discuss the proposal. Liberia\u2019s government is working on developing a legal framework for carbon developers that highlights \u201ccarbon belongs to the state\u201d, he says, and is also consulting with civil society on the Blue Carbon project. \u201cWe value their position.\u201d\n\nTarpeh estimates that Liberia had 2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide locked into its forest, absorbed through photosynthesis. \u201cThe size of the carbon stock is huge, so anybody will be tempted to sell our carbon,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it has to be a rules-based system. It\u2019s not like buying a candy bar.\u201d\n\nOther countries approached by Blue Carbon have been in a stronger position to respond.\n\nThe foreign and environment ministers of South America\u2019s Suriname, another small country almost entirely covered in tropical forest, received a similar offer to that of Liberia when they flew out for pitch meetings with al-Maktoum in Blue Carbon\u2019s offices in the Burj Al Salam skyscraper in Dubai in August.\n\nSuriname\u2019s gross domestic product per capita is about 10 times greater than Liberia\u2019s and its government has more than a decade of experience engaging with financing mechanisms for emission reduction, including under the UN\u2019s ill-fated Clean Development Mechanism, which had its roots in the 1997 Kyoto protocol eventually superseded by the Paris agreement.\n\nSo the ministers were better able to push back against Blue Carbon\u2019s initial proposal to take a significant cut of future carbon credit revenues, according to an adviser to Suriname on the deal who asked not to be named.\n\nA person close to Suriname\u2019s environment ministry confirmed that it was still considering Blue Carbon\u2019s latest updated offer, alongside other offers for its 4.8mn credits tied to national deforestation reduction.\n\nBut such offers can be hard to turn down. \u201c[Blue Carbon\u2019s] pitch is that they have untold wealth from the royal family,\u201d the adviser says, a powerful incentive for poorer countries looking to insure themselves against volatility in carbon pricing.\n\nApproached by the FT about its offers to Suriname, Blue Carbon said it wanted to investigate \u201cthese false allegations\u201d, but did not specify details.\n\nOther countries have moved to put protections around their arrangements. In Tanzania, a tough taxation regime for carbon credit trading came into force shortly before Blue Carbon signed a memorandum of understanding for future development of 8mn hectares of forest in February with the country\u2019s forestry agency. Local authorities receive 61 per cent of revenues from carbon credit sales.\n\nBlue Carbon has not said what proportion of the credits it develops in Liberia, Kenya and elsewhere it would sell to the UAE versus selling these on to other countries, or potentially other companies. The investment vehicle told the FT it expects a \u201cdiverse customer and buyer base\u201d, and operated separately to the government.\n\nAs negotiators from each country present at COP28 battle over how best to strengthen the framework for governments to trade carbon credits, one priority is to avoid repeating mistakes made by corporate buyers and sellers on issues of accounting and human rights.\n\nDirk Forrester, head of the International Emissions Trading Association, representing carbon traders and developers, says developing countries are losing investment because of a slowdown in appetite for carbon credits in voluntary markets. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone hit the great reset button in the sky\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and [the pull back] appears to be slowing climate action rather than accelerating it.\u201d\n\nIn particular, scientists have pointed to several flaws in the idea of issuing credits to reward a developer for protecting a forest from hypothetical future deforestation, as Blue Carbon is expected to do.\n\nVerra, the largest accreditation body for voluntary credits, has denied claims that it over-credited projects based on inflated projections of future deforestation. But at the same time it says it is rethinking its methodology for forest-based credits.\n\nThe UN supervisory bodies tasked with rewriting the rules for the international carbon credit market hope negotiators at the summit convene on a common standard.\n\n\u201cI think there is no moral justification for independent standards to exist,\u201d Olga Gassan-zade, head of one of the bodies, told the FT before the start of the summit. She hopes the UN\u2019s mechanisms would one day eclipse the private sector approval systems for credits that have been tarnished by controversies in the past year. \u201cWe are able to move forward on nature-based [credits] and learn from their mistakes.\u201d\n\nUnder the UN\u2019s nascent system, governments must cancel out any emission reductions sold within their borders by inflating their own carbon footprint, to avoid double counting between countries. This could boost public confidence in the stated climate benefit of carbon credits, analysts say. But it would also heighten political risk for foreign developers of carbon credits, because each credit sold makes it harder for a government to hit its own climate target.\n\nNo matter the fairness of the terms, poorer countries will continue to be attracted to carbon credit deals because of the scarcity of other financing to help pay for the effects of climate change, argues Gilles Dufrasne, a policy lead at the non-profit Carbon Market Watch.\n\n\u201cRicher countries have not delivered the climate finance [developing countries] need so they are turning to what they can access\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and the only system that seems mainstream and hyped at the moment\u00a0is carbon credits.\u201d\n\nIn defining what counts as a carbon credit and who should profit from them, the stakes are high. Honduras has already deployed a tenth of its standing army to protect its forest stock and to boost its chances of selling deforestation reduction credits to richer countries in future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about climate justice\u201d, says Lucky Medina, the country\u2019s minister for natural resources and the environment. \u201cThe vision is that the money [from carbon credits] is for the countries, not individuals\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009in a sovereign market, the carbon cowboys or brokers should not exist.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Aanu Adeoye in Lagos.

Some had to wait so long to make a late afternoon speech, they ended up addressing a hall left empty by delegates who had headed to dinner. And they were far from the only luckless industry captains last week at the vast COP28 climate conference in Dubai.\n\nJohn Neal, chief executive of the Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market, was among a raft of business leaders who queued for more than two hours in the desert heat to enter the sprawling Dubai Expo City conference venue.\n\nOne business adviser later confided he and his boss were trying to avoid the Expo venue as much as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to just stick to the hotels.\u201d\n\nBy that he meant the plush hotels dotted around the city where executives have gathered for a parallel series of COP business events, far from the chaotic bustle of the actual COP.\n\nBut if business finds COPs hard going, the feeling can be mutual.\n\nThis finding has emerged from research carried out by Archie Young, the UK\u2019s former lead climate negotiator, now at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School.\n\nHe recently spent months interviewing government officials, negotiators, NGOs and business people for the Centre for Multilateral Negotiations, a group set up to foster successful global talks.\n\nThe effort was sparked by concerns that the mushrooming presence of businesses at COPs wasn\u2019t advancing the conferences\u2019 core aim of tackling climate change as well as it could or should.\n\n\u201cThe growing numbers of companies here offer a big opportunity to advance climate action, but it\u2019s becoming clear that it needs to be carefully managed,\u201d Young told me over an orange juice at another venue for business events miles from the COP28 centre.\n\nHis interviewees were broadly positive about the advantages business could potentially bring to COPs. But some climate negotiators had also said the \u201ccircus\u201d of business events, kiosks and panels was making COPs too crowded and chaotic. \u201cOne said explicitly, \u2018It hinders and hampers our work. There are too many people here\u2019,\u201d he said, adding that was a minority view.\n\nThe critics weren\u2019t talking about the fossil fuel groups that have been coming to COPs since the first one in 1995 and are here in force at COP28. Rather, it\u2019s the fact that scores of other companies now come to COPs, from drug groups to banks, big tech and truckmakers.\n\nYet private sector expertise \u2014 and investment \u2014 is needed now that UN climate talks are supposed to be implementing an accord, the 2015 Paris Agreement, not forging a new one.\n\nAn estimated $5tn a year of low-carbon investments will be needed by 2030. And as Ajay Banga, the World Bank Group president, told a Bloomberg conference on Sunday, all the world\u2019s multilateral development banks, governments and philanthropies put together \u201cdon\u2019t have that kind of money\u201d. \u201cNot even Mike,\u201d he added, referring to the billionaire founder of the financial data and news group, Michael Bloomberg.\n\nBut navigating a global energy transition at speed also requires technical expertise and business experience.\n\nYoung concluded COPs needed better ways to enhance business and government collaboration. And executives need to recognise it\u2019s no good if, as he puts it, \u201cbusiness only turns up for a pavilion, a panel and some prosecco\u201d.\n\nIn other words, they need to be aware COPs are not just another corporate event.\n\nOne chief executive, ExxonMobil\u2019s Darren Woods, had a brush with this reality last week. He arrived in Dubai for his first COP just as nearly 120 countries pledged to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\nWoods has long championed other technologies that in theory allow fossil fuels to be burnt cleanly, such as carbon capture. But when he repeated his thoughts in an interview with the Financial Times in Dubai, they did not land well.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because the businesses coming to COP are changing.

Some developers are now seeking additional government support to continue with the projects.\n\nEast Anglia Three has a strike price of \u00a337.35 per megawatt hour, the guaranteed maximum price the government pays operators for the electricity they generate, though it is further advanced than many other projects with construction expected to start next spring.\n\nLast month, the government increased the maximum strike price for its next offshore wind auction to \u00a373 per megawatt hour to reflect more challenging conditions in the sector.\n\nHusain Al Meer, Masdar\u2019s director of global offshore wind and UK, told the Financial Times that the \u201cmarket has been going through a tough time\u201d but that this represented an opportunity for the state-backed company to deploy \u201cdry powder\u201d. \u201cWe have a lot of capital to deploy, but we are very selective\u201d, he said.\n\nAsked about criticism of Emirati investment in the UK, including the Telegraph deal, he said: \u201cWe enjoy a very strong relationship with the UK. We\u2019ve been investing in the UK for a long time; this is part of our commitment to the UK that we will keep investing in infrastructure and the energy transition.\u201d\n\nThe proposed deal follows the launch by the UAE of a $30bn climate-related investment fund with BlackRock, TPG and Brookfield.\n\nAnalysis by the Financial Times last week found that UAE state companies and funds could be linked to almost $200bn in global investments in the year leading up to the COP summit, mostly in green energy.\n\nUtility companies often sell stakes in their facilities after the initial development stage but Masdar\u2019s recent large investments show it is taking an active role in the development of wind farms.\n\nLast week, it bought a 49 per cent stake from German utility RWE in the UK\u2019s \u00a311bn Dogger Bank South project. It also agreed in July to acquire a 49 per cent stake in an Iberdrola 476MW offshore wind farm in the Baltic Sea, worth \u20ac1.6bn.\n\n\u201cWhen we take 49 per cent, it\u2019s a clear signal that Masdar is becoming a developer, we\u2019re going to share development risk and deploy people alongside Iberdrola and co-develop the projects,\u201d said Al Meer. \u201cWe\u2019d like to go to 50\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009or even take 100 per cent of projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have been buying other assets elsewhere but they\u2019re definitely keen on the UK,\u201d said Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at Bernstein. \u201cMaybe because of the COP presidency, there\u2019s more willingness on the part of the UAE to push more money in now.\u201d\n\nThe Iberdrola agreements form part of up to \u20ac15bn in funding that Masdar and the Spanish group have agreed to mobilise at COP to back renewable energy projects.\n\n\u201cBy combining our renewables experience and financial strength with those of Masdar, we can deliver more secure, competitive and clean energy quicker,\u201d said Ignacio Gal\u00e1n, Iberdrola\u2019s executive chair.\n\nAdditional reporting by David Sheppard in London", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/921d1d30-2487-4963-8001-b1c2baf9c367"}}, {"id": "3dfd2e6f-ecd1-4a68-84b0-ee14b9083489", "event_name": "Vladimir Putin to visit UAE and Saudi Arabia this week", "blurb": "Russian president enjoys close ties with both oil-exporting states, which have remained neutral in Ukraine war", "date": "2023-12-0500:00:00.0", "body": "Vladimir Putin is set to visit both Saudi Arabia and the UAE on Wednesday, the first time he has travelled to the region since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced the working visits on Tuesday, saying that \u201cthe parties will discuss bilateral relations and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict\u201d.\n\nSaudi Arabia is Russia\u2019s key partner in Opec+, while the UAE has become the main international hub for Russian businesses and a significant route for circumventing western sanctions.\n\nPutin enjoys close relations with both the oil-exporting Gulf states, which have remained neutral in the Ukraine conflict.

That\u2019s where you will find the oil companies talking about [technology like] carbon capture and storage.\u201d\n\nFor smaller businesses or those with interesting technology, the COP was a big opportunity to showcase their products, he said.\n\nThe cohort of senior bankers at the summit has also swelled, as finance for climate-related projects moves into the front lines, growing since Glasgow\u2019s COP26 when the financial alliance was launched with Bank of America boss Brian Moynihan and Standard Chartered\u2019s Bill Winters.\n\nSteven van Rijswijk, chief executive of ING, who is also in Dubai, said the Dutch bank was keen to be part of the financing of the energy transition.\n\n\u201c[COP] is always the place where all relevant players come together, so it is good to be there too, to be part of the conversation,\u00a0to hear what the developments are, what everyone thinks about it and to make clear what we can contribute and what we expect,\u201d Rijswijk said.\n\nBut Paul Morgenthaler, managing partner at venture capital group CommerzVentures, says COP is little more than \u201ca business conference where oil deals are struck\u201d.\n\nConcerns about the fossil fuel industry\u2019s roles at the summit have been amplified this year, because host country the United Arab Emirates is one of the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producers. COP28 president Sultan al-Jaber is also the boss of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.\n\nThe UAE has been linked to about $200bn in deals, largely in green energy, in the run-up to COP28, according to Financial Times analysis. At the start of the summit, it announced a \u00a330bn climate-focused investment vehicle, working with asset managers including Brookfield and BlackRock. Both Brookfield\u2019s Connor Teskey and BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink were in Dubai.\n\nThe size of the COPs has ballooned in recent years, with registered attendees upwards of 80,000 not including a large support staff at the venue.\n\nSome have called for COP to be slimmed down, refocusing on the climate negotiations. Morgenthaler believes the present format has \u201cproven ineffective at addressing the challenge we are up against\u201d.\n\nOthers, including Jaber, argue the business world should be at the annual climate summit, because it has a chief role in shifting economies to become greener.\n\nThe private sector will need to provide trillions of dollars in financing for the shift to greener economies if the world is to meet its goals of limiting global temperature rises.\n\nLloyd\u2019s Neal said he would welcome an agreement between countries on whether to phase out fossil fuels as this would provide more \u201ccertainty\u201d to the business world. The leading insurance market sent Neal along with its chair Bruce Carnegie-Brown.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have that conversation at some point, so why not have it now?\u201d he said, describing the climate transition as \u201cthe biggest single opportunity we will have ever seen\u201d.\n\nAcknowledging that Lloyd\u2019s does not require its own members to stop underwriting new oil and gas projects, he said this type of decision was best left to politicians and negotiators.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the private sector should say \u2018we will stop insuring fossil fuels in 2035\u2019. That\u2019s for governments to determine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a strange sort of way, it\u2019s trying to get the government and leadership to think, \u2018why don\u2019t you just get in front of the story?\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve got a private sector that will help with the financing, help with the transition.\u201d\n\nBanerjee said that businesses play a role in influencing whatever agreement countries reach.\n\n\u201cThe COP people love to say: \u2018Oh look, a small country can veto an agreement\u2019. Sure they can.

Leaders must deliver in Dubai,\u201d he said. \u201cCOP28 must show a clear agreement to leave fossil fuel dependency behind.\u201d\n\nTeresa Ribera, the Spanish minister responsible for dealing with climate, told the FT that the UN summit would only be a success if there was \u201can ambitious decision on mitigation\u201d, or how to tackle global warming.\n\n\u201cThe energy sector must be predominantly free of fossil fuels ahead of 2050,\u201d Ribera added.\n\nUS climate envoy John Kerry said Washington supported calls for a phaseout of unabated fossil fuels, or those burnt without the emissions captured.\n\n\u201cWe all know what the problem is. It is this burning of fossil fuel without abatement,\u201d he said, adding that the US would be calling for much faster action on climate change at the summit. The US remains the world\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer but has strived under the administration of President Joe Biden to shift its economy to green energy through $369bn worth of incentives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to move at a much, much faster rate and deploy many more trillions of dollars in order to achieve our goals, and that has to be hammered home every day relentlessly in an effort to get what we need to do to win this battle,\u201d Kerry said.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/df65e47b-aac8-45dc-b41c-2822f05acd78"}}, {"id": "7caa4c1c-9cc6-4b53-beb3-95f48eea7618", "event_name": "Spare us the sanctimony on fit and proper media owners", "blurb": "The UAE-Telegraph deal should probably be blocked but the roll call of UK press barons is hardly one to shout about", "date": "2023-11-2900:00:00.0", "body": "By all means block the deal but spare us the sanctimony. A campaign is on to prevent Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, vice-president of the United Arab Emirates, buying a major piece of the British media. That the titles in question, the Daily and Sunday Telegraph and the Spectator, are about the most important publications to the Conservative party is quickening anxiety.\n\nFor all the shifts in the media landscape, newspaper groups, and the rightwing press particularly,\u00a0still carry an outsize weight in setting the political\u00a0agenda. So it is not hard to see why the\u00a0ownership of the Tory house journals \u2014 previously home to Boris Johnson\u2019s scratchings \u2014 matters to Conservatives, who are making their case with high moral tone. They have a devastatingly simple argument. Sheikh Mansour is a leader of a foreign nation and one that does not believe in freedom of the press.\n\nThe UAE is a valued ally and investor in the UK. But it is not a good place to be a journalist. In the words of Reporters Without Borders (RSF): \u201cAs soon as they emit the slightest criticism, journalists and bloggers find themselves in the crosshairs of the UAE\u2019s authorities, who are masters of online surveillance.\u201d They can face prison for \u201cinsulting the state or spreading false information\u201d. In RSF\u2019s rankings of press freedom, the UAE stands 145th out of 180.\n\nWhile the Spectator is thriving, the Telegraph (where I worked in the 1990s) is not the institution it was. Once a bastion of serious if somewhat crusty journalism, the title now too often descends into shrill populist paranoia and heated anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nThe would-be buyers are a joint venture of the Sheikh\u2019s IMI and a US private equity firm RedBird Capital. Their supporters argue that IMI is not a UAE state entity \u2014 though it comes close \u2014 and point to safeguards to protect editorial independence. Redbird will run the titles alone under the vigilant leadership of former CNN president Jeff Zucker. Sheikh Mansour, we are told, will be a passive investor.\n\nYet media history shows how little these defences are worth and it is naive to believe coverage would be allowed to be inimical to the UAE\u2019s interests. As other proprietors have shown, you don\u2019t need to interfere directly as long as you appoint an editor whose views align with yours and who is \u201csensitive\u201d to your interests. The UAE has many welcome UK investments including Manchester City. But a football club cannot help decide the next Tory leader.\n\nSo yes, those calling for the UK to block the deal under public interest powers are right. For all the assurances, there is a principle here. A state-related entity from a country with no regard for press freedom at home should not own, even passively, a pillar of the British media.\u00a0(I should note that the Financial Times is part of an employee-owned Japanese media group.)\n\nBut if we are going to have this conversation, let\u2019s spare ourselves the humbug of pretending that existing British media moguls are as hands-off and virtuous as a Disney princess is chaste. Individuals buy newspapers for status or power and invariably use them to advance personal or professional interests. And the roll call of UK press barons is hardly one to shout about.\n\nIn 2015, the Telegraph\u2019s chief political commentator resigned, claiming that the Barclay family, the outgoing owners, were suppressing stories about HSBC because it was an important advertiser. He similarly blamed the title\u2019s relative silence over Hong Kong on a fear of upsetting Chinese interests.\u00a0The Barclays\u2019 predecessor, Conrad Black, was jailed for fraud in the US. He was later pardoned by Donald Trump.\n\nIf the Redbird IMI deal is blocked, the beneficiary could be the bid led by Sir Paul Marshall, co-owner of GB News, which gives airtime to race-baiters and conspiracy theorists.\n\nRobert Maxwell, the late owner of the Mirror, stole hundreds of millions from the company\u2019s pension fund. A perennial interferer in his papers, he even rigged a \u201cspot the ball\u201d competition to avoid paying out the \u00a31mn prize.\n\nLord Evgeny Lebedev, the current co-owner of the Evening Standard, owes his media empire to the money made by his father, a former KGB officer and Russian oligarch, currently on Canada\u2019s sanctions list. Lebedev, a supporter of Boris Johnson in the London mayoral elections, ennobled by the former prime minister, also part-owns the Independent with a Saudi businessman thought to be close to the regime.\n\nAnd then there is Rupert Murdoch. The tycoon is a genuine newsman who saved the British press from the grip of the print unions. But his political influence is immense and, to many, malign. Aside from that, his stewardship has been replete with scandals. The UK phone-hacking saga, centred on his papers, led to the closure of a title and the jailing of journalists. One of the then editors is now his CEO at News UK. In the US, his Fox News network paid out $787mn to the Dominion voting equipment business for accusing it of being part of a plot to steal the 2020 presidential election, a claim the network knew was untrue.\n\nThese then are some of the existing owners. Viewed against them, the damage the sheikh could do is probably limited. And yet the conservative campaigners are probably right. There is an absolute principle worth defending.\n\nOn that basis the deal should probably be blocked. But let\u2019s not delude ourselves about what counts for a fit and proper owner in the UK.\n\nrobert.shrimsley@ft.com", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d56dd771-2b2b-49a2-b2a0-a7373d322640"}}, {"id": "6df4de7e-743e-4227-a26a-a4dfcd60d84d", "event_name": "UAE planned to use COP28 summit for oil deals, documents show", "blurb": "Leak appears to outline talking points for discussions with foreign governments", "date": "2023-11-2700:00:00.0", "body": "The United Arab Emirates planned to use meetings about the COP28 climate summit it is hosting later this week to pitch oil and gas deals to foreign governments, according to leaked briefing documents obtained by the non-profit Centre for Climate Reporting alongside the BBC.\n\nSultan al-Jaber, president-designate of this year\u2019s UN climate summit, has called for a \u201cphaseout\u201d of fossil fuels globally.

The documents have not been verified by the Financial Times. A spokesperson for COP said the documents were \u201cinaccurate\u201d, \u201cunverified\u201d and had not been used by COP28 in meetings.\n\nThe UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees the summit, did not reply to a request for comment.

Arnous\u2019 name also appears on a list of speakers for the summit previously published by the UN.\n\nEarlier this year the UAE invited Syria\u2019s President Bashar al-Assad to attend as part of an \u201cinclusive COP process\u201d, and against the backdrop of increasing normalisation of ties between the Syrian government and other Middle Eastern states. It would have been Assad\u2019s first global summit since 2011 featuring western governments who opposed him in Syria\u2019s bloody civil war.\n\nCOP28 is likely to host a fierce debate over emerging economies\u2019 continued reliance on polluting fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas.\n\nAlmost 200 countries committed at COP26 in 2021 in Glasgow to \u201cphase down\u201d \u2014 rather than \u201cphase out\u201d \u2014 coal power, but use of the fossil fuel has barely declined, especially as energy demand expands in countries including China, India and Indonesia.\n\nBiden\u2019s likely absence from COP28 had been expected as he grapples with war in the Middle East and prepares for a re-election campaign in 2024.\n\nBut the apparent decision to skip the gathering of world leaders is still striking given that Biden has placed the fight against climate change high on his domestic and international agendas and attended the last two climate summits in the UK and Egypt.\n\nThe White House said on Monday: \u201cSince day one, President Biden has led and delivered on the most ambitious climate agenda in history, both at home and abroad.

There is also a risk that 2023 becomes the year that multilateral co-operation on climate fractures, if leaders do not respond at the scale and with the urgency the science demands. As COP28 starts in Dubai against a backdrop of divisive geopolitics, governments need to demonstrate that working together on our shared challenges is not only necessary but possible.\n\nThe need for collective action is urgent, and the cost of inaction catastrophic. Yet leaders have not done enough. We are well off-track in curbing global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the limit set out in the Paris Agreement. The latest UN assessment shows current climate policies would mean a predicted 9 per cent rise in global emissions from 2010 to 2030, despite scientific consensus demanding a 45 per cent reduction in the same timeframe. Meanwhile, despite projections of global clean energy investments reaching $1.7tn in 2023, oil and gas industry profits soared to an estimated $4tn last year while fossil fuel subsidies hit a record $7tn.\n\nCOP28 will unfold amid intersecting crises: the horror in Israel and Gaza, Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and the cost of living crisis are all at the forefront of international concern. However, global stability is inextricably linked with addressing the many other grave challenges that humanity faces, not least the climate crisis.\n\nCOP28 presents a pivotal moment for the United Arab Emirates, as it steers these critical negotiations regarding our shared future. The UAE presidency is not without controversy, given the country\u2019s domestic plans to expand fossil fuel production. But if it rises to the occasion with bold leadership, it could convince other major fossil fuel stakeholders to deliver a robust COP28 outcome with enhanced commitments.\n\nThe summit\u2019s president, Sultan al-Jaber, has acknowledged the inevitability of a global transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. Given his position as the chief executive of the national oil company, he is uniquely placed to chart a path forward \u2014 but this cannot be with a slow phase down of fossil fuels. Instead we need a phase out with clear timelines. While a commitment to triple investments in clean energy by 2030 could be significant, the mantle of leadership at COP28 demands more. It is incumbent upon the presidency to raise ambition for an outcome that speaks to the urgency we face.\n\nThe burden of delivering a successful COP28 also extends to all governments, particularly those of nations historically responsible for generating most emissions. I am deeply troubled by some domestic policy reversals undermining progress \u2014 from tax cuts sparking an increase in emissions in Sweden, to the UK\u2019s new North Sea oil and gas pledges, to the continuing oil and gas expansion in both Brazil and Norway \u2014 all moves that contradict their public commitments. While the US Inflation Reduction Act marks a major step forward, the surge in oil drilling permits under President Joe Biden \u2014 surpassing those of his predecessor \u2014 is worrying. Such inconsistency is untenable; leaders must align domestic policy with the reality of the climate emergency.\n\nRich countries need to get into crisis mode, spearheading efforts to drastically curb their own emissions and build resilience, while providing support to the least economically developed\u00a0nations.

According to figures from the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, Swiss exports to the UAE for January to September are up 11.5 per cent year on year, and up 29.4 per cent when compared with the same period in 2021.\n\nThere has long been an active collector market for vintage watches with what Christie\u2019s Geneva head Remi Guillemin calls \u201cArabic dials\u201d \u2014 in particular, those with the Khanjar national symbol of Oman and the UAE national crest with the signature of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that these collectors are not necessarily from the region,\u201d says Guillemin. \u201cWe have interest in [these watches] from clients from Australia to the US. Their continued appeal lies in the fact that they are extremely rare and represent a certain moment in the history of this region.\u201d\n\nSeddiqi\u2019s efforts to kick-start a market for modern regional edition watches started over a decade ago. \u201cMy father had a white gold day-date with Hindi numerals and, in 2012, we started using the Hindi numerals with Hublot when we did the Vision in titanium and rose gold,\u201d he says.\n\nSales of the initial limited edition of 100 pieces with Hublot were so swift that they inspired others. \u201cIt was an inspiration for a lot of the watch industry to come back with the Indian numerals. Many brands have implemented Hindi numerals specifically for the Middle East market and we see that demand worldwide has increased.\u201d\n\nAs for the special editions launched at this year\u2019s Dubai Watch Week, Seddiqi says everything was pre-sold before the event started.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, chief executive of Tag Heuer \u2014 which has just presented a limited-edition Dubai tourbillon \u2014 feels that \u201cshowing respect to local culture\u201d stimulates interest and yields new customers. On the secondary market, Arnault has noticed those particular special edition watches attracting a minimum 30 per cent premium over their retail price.\n\nOne of the most sought-after Hindi or eastern Arabic numeral-dial watches is the platinum Rolex Daytona. According to Remy Julia, head of watches for auction house Christie\u2019s in Dubai, the secondary market price of a regular platinum Daytona is $80,000-$90,000, whereas the Hindi-numeral version is $140,000-$150,000. \u201cThis has dropped from about $250,000, but I think it is going to go back up,\u201d he predicts.\n\nBig brands are not the only ones benefiting from this regional specificity. Last month, a Moritz Grossmann in steel with eastern Arabic numerals sold via Christie\u2019s for $37,800 against a presale estimate of $10,000-$20,000. This sale, says Julia, \u201ceducated us on the brand and its level of watchmaking, its attractiveness, and the level of interest with multiple clients\u201d. He adds that, for small brands, these local editions provide \u201ca platform with resonance that they would never usually be able to afford\u201d.\n\nFor Seddiqi, the popularity of UAE special editions has encouraged him to explore fresh creative avenues with watch brands. One of his favourites was produced by Bovet. \u201cIt was a combination of Arabic and Hindi, with the upper numerals in Arabic and the lower numerals in Hindi,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was following the trend of what Panerai did with the California dial, but we twisted it a bit to cater to our market. This kind of dial is something close to my heart, something totally new.\u201d\n\nSeddiqi has further broadened the concept this year, with 16 limited UAE edition watches being launched during Dubai Watch Week. Not all have Hindi numerals. \u201cWe have two Hublots that do not use the numerals but have Arabic calligraphy on the dial,\u201d he says. \u201cWe commissioned a calligrapher in Dubai and talked to Hublot about having his artwork in the dial. The calligraphy is in different colours and is also Super-Luminova, so it glows in the dark.\n\n\u201cThen, with the Hindi numerals, we\u2019re doing a Breitling GMT. It will feature Hindi numerals on a nice electric-blue dial. And we changed the name from GMT to DMT \u2014 Dubai Mean Time. Today, [with] Dubai being an important city and considered the centre of the world, we thought that we have to highlight Dubai. Maybe the people at Greenwich might be upset,\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\n\u201cBut we just thought it would be nice for the people who are visiting Dubai Watch Week to have something that is made specifically for the market.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/38d4c1a8-cf99-4585-990d-a7e2a7310a90"}}, {"id": "bed84306-2bd0-4e64-bdab-feed3fac40de", "event_name": "Middle Eastern carriers place orders worth tens of billions of dollars", "blurb": "Deals for over 100 aircraft on first day of Dubai air show cement industry rebound despite regional tensions  ", "date": "2023-11-1300:00:00.0", "body": "Middle Eastern airlines placed orders worth tens of billions of dollars for more than 100 passenger jets on the opening day of the Dubai air show, underscoring the rebound in the aviation industry even as regional tensions run high.\n\nEmirates, the Dubai-based carrier, placed an order for 90 of Boeing\u2019s 777X aircraft, the world\u2019s largest twin-engined passenger jet, valued at $52bn at list prices.\n\nIts low-cost sister airline, Flydubai, followed up with an order for 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, which would be the first widebody aircraft in its fleet, worth $11bn at list prices.\u00a0The US aircraft maker also picked up a commitment from Royal Jordanian for its 787 jet.\n\nThe flood of orders comes despite concerns over a fall in demand for air travel in the region due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nBookings for flights to the Middle East fell in the three weeks following the Hamas attacks on Israel, dropping from 13 per cent above 2019 levels to 13 per cent below, according to industry data provider ForwardKeys.\n\nSales for flights from the region fell 10 percentage points.\n\nYet demand for the industry\u2019s biggest jets is soaring after a prolonged downturn following the coronavirus pandemic, which severely dented long-haul travel.\n\nMuch of the demand is expected to be driven by Middle Eastern airlines over the next two decades.

Earlier this year, Cerebras signed a $100mn deal to provide nine supercomputers to G42, one of the biggest contracts of its kind for a would-be rival to Nvidia.\n\n\u201cThe UAE has been a pioneer in this space (AI), we are ahead of the game, hopefully. We see this as a global race,\u201d said Andrew Jackson, chief executive of Inception, the AI applied research unit of G42, which is backed by private equity giant Silver Lake. \u201cMost LLMs are English-focused. Arabic is one of the largest languages in the world. Why shouldn\u2019t the Arabic-speaking community have an LLM?\u201d\n\nHowever, the Gulf states\u2019 goal of leadership in AI has also raised concerns about potential misuse of the technology by the oil-rich states\u2019 autocratic leaders.\n\nThe most advanced LLMs today, including GPT-4, which powers OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Google\u2019s PaLM behind its Bard chatbot, and Meta\u2019s open-source model LLaMA, all have the ability to understand and generate text in Arabic. However, G42\u2019s Jackson said the Arabic element within existing models, which can work in up to 100 languages, was \u201cheavily diluted\u201d.\n\nJais performs better than Falcon, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA, when benchmarked on its accuracy in Arabic, according to its creators. The developers of Falcon, however, said its software hadn\u2019t been pre-trained in Arabic. Jais has also been designed to have a more accurate understanding of the culture and context of the region, in contrast to most US-centric models, said Professor Timothy Baldwin, acting provost of MBZUAI.\n\nHe added that guardrails had been created to ensure that Jais \u201cdoes not step outside of reasonable bounds in terms of cultural and religious sensibilities\u201d.\n\nBefore its launch, extensive testing was conducted to weed out \u201charmful\u201d or \u201csensitive\u201d content, as well as \u201coffensive or inappropriate output that does not represent the values of the organisations involved in the development of the model\u201d, he added.\n\nNamed after the highest mountain in the UAE, Jais was trained over 21 days on a subset of Cerebras\u2019s Condor Galaxy 1 AI supercomputer by a team in Abu Dhabi.

In all, officials from 42 states, including many that have resisted western pressure to take sides on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, attended the gathering in Jeddah.\n\nBy the talks\u2019 end, there were few discernible developments beyond China hinting that it may be willing to take part in future discussions.\u00a0But for Prince Mohammed the two-day gathering was an undoubted success. It gave the young Saudi royal the perfect stage to project his worldview \u2014 one that envisages the kingdom as a rising power whose influence stretches from east to west.\n\nIt is a mindset that reflects the lofty ambitions and soaring confidence of oil-rich Gulf states \u2014 buoyed by petrodollar windfalls after last year\u2019s surge in energy prices \u2014 that are determined to chart their own courses in an era of polarising, shifting global dynamics.\n\nAt the forefront are the Gulf\u2019s two powerhouses: Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, and the United Arab Emirates, the region\u2019s dominant trade hub, both of whose focus has been increasingly turning eastwards.\n\nWhere others view the shifting global currents through the lens of risk, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi see opportunities as they leverage their financial muscle and abundant oil resources to strategically hedge against their traditional relations with the west.\n\nThe common theme in both Gulf states is one of self-assured, assertive leaders who are no longer willing to accept binary \u201cwith us or against us\u201d US demands.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan has for years deployed his small state\u2019s military prowess and financial firepower to ensure it punches above its weight. Equally, Prince Mohammed has been quick to deploy hundreds of billions of dollars in pursuit of grandiose plans to develop his nation, and wants it to be recognised as a top G20 power, economically and diplomatically.\n\nAllies, but also increasingly economic competitors, both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are bent on projecting their standing on the international stage through broader networks as so-called friends with all, and pursuing their own self-interest.\n\nPartly driven by shifting trade patterns but also the result of geopolitics, it is manifesting itself in the diversification of ties with the US \u2014 long the dominant foreign power in the Gulf \u2014 and deepening relationships with Asian powers, particularly China and India.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia and the UAE see more opportunities than risks in this changing world order, and they think they have the policies and instruments to become poles of the emerging multipolar world,\u201d says Emile Hokayem, director of regional security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cThey have a very opportunistic, flexible and transactional approach. The time when one could expect full alignment from them is over.\u201d\n\nThe shift in the Gulf has been driven most visibly by trade. China \u2014 the region\u2019s biggest trading partner \u2014 India and Japan have become the prime buyers of Gulf crude, while US oil imports from the region have declined over the past 15 years following the shale gas boom in North America.\n\nYet relationships with Asian powers have also developed far beyond oil, with the Gulf states thirsty for new technologies across artificial intelligence, energy, logistics and life sciences to support domestic development plans and diversify oil-dependent economies.\n\n\u201cOur ties to established markets are unshakeable,\u201d says a senior Emirati official. But \u201cat the same time, from a macro sense, where is new growth coming from if we look at the next 10, 20 years? It\u2019s coming from big markets in Asia, some in South America, and potentially some African markets.\u201d\n\nBoth the Gulf states have sealed \u201ccomprehensive strategic\u201d partnerships with China. When Prince Mohammed hosted Chinese president Xi Jinping in Jeddah for a series of Arab summits in December, he said the gatherings launched a \u201cnew historical era\u201d in relations with Beijing, adding that the kingdom was working on \u201cenhancing co-operation to serve international stability\u201d.\n\nA Chinese official tells the FT that Beijing\u2019s relations with the Gulf \u201care a model for the developing world and for participants in the Belt and Road Initiative\u201d. Describing deepening co-operation on energy, infrastructure, finance, technology, the official says the Gulf and China \u201ccan help to build a fairer multilateral\u00a0order in the Middle East that respects sovereign rights and resists the hegemony of certain powers.\u201d\n\nIt is not just China that the Gulf nations are focusing on. The UAE, home to sovereign investment funds that manage more than $1.3tn, has signed free trade agreements with six nations, including India and Indonesia, in the past 18 months.\n\nWhen Indian prime minister Narendra Modi visited the UAE in July \u2014 his fifth visit to the Gulf state in eight years \u2014 it was announced that the $850bn Abu Dhabi Investment Authority would establish a presence in Gujarat in the next \u201cfew months\u201d. The only overseas office for Adia is in Hong Kong.\n\nThe two Gulf states are also seeking to join Brics, the economies that include China, India, Brazil, Russia and South Africa. Gulf officials say it is a logical move given global trade patterns, but also one that grants them a voice in an important \u2014 and welcoming \u2014 diplomatic network.\n\n\u201cAny country wants to be consequential, wants to have a seat at the table,\u201d says Anwar Gargash, an adviser to Sheikh Mohammed, speaking about the UAE\u2019s wider ambitions. \u201cWe want to build bridges with everyone.\u201d\n\nThe trend has complicated US relations with traditional Arab allies, with divisions becoming more visible in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nLike Turkey and Brazil, \u201cthey don\u2019t want to have to choose between the United States and China, they don\u2019t want to have to choose a side in the Ukraine war,\u201d says former US diplomat Jeffrey Feltman. \u201cThey, in fact, have some benefits to not making a choice, in the same way the United States liked having China and the Soviet Union to be able to leverage one against the other during the cold war.\u201d\n\nAt the Ukraine war\u2019s outset, the UAE rattled the Biden administration by using its temporary seat on the UN Security Council to join China and India in abstaining on a US resolution condemning Moscow, in an extraordinary expression of frustration with American policies.\n\nBoth Abu Dhabi and Riyadh have rebuffed western efforts to cajole them into abandoning Vladimir Putin, with whom they co-operate on oil through Opec+ and consider an important player \u2014 and potential spoiler \u2014 in the Middle East.\n\nA month before Modi\u2019s visit to Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed was telling the Russian president that he wished to build on the relationship with Moscow.\n\nHe was one of the few global leaders to attend the St Petersburg International Economic Forum which his adviser Gargash describes as a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d. The UAE, like Saudi Arabia, offers itself as a mediator\u00a0between Moscow and the west.\u00a0\u201cA lot of people\u00a0would criticise him [for making] the trip,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut Sheikh Mohammed was saying\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m here to help in whatever way.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor decades, the Gulf was firmly in the US\u2019s orbit with relationships founded on the unwritten compact that Washington would be their security guarantor while Arab oil producers ensured stable global energy supplies. Saudi Arabia, once a staunch opponent of communism, only recognised China in 1990.\n\nThe UAE in particular actively carved out a role as arguably Washington\u2019s closest Arab ally, taking part in every US-led military coalition since the 1991 Gulf war, bar the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE spent tens of billions of dollars on American military hardware, while investing much of their petrodollar surpluses in US assets.\n\nYet relations grew increasingly fractious after then President Barack Obama was perceived to have ignored Saudi and Emirati interests in the wake of the 2011 Arab uprisings. Ties were further strained by Obama\u2019s decision to sign the 2015 nuclear agreement with their rival, Iran.\n\nThe mood improved after Donald Trump entered the White House and pursued transactional relationships, paid zero attention to rights abuses in the autocratic Gulf and abandoned the nuclear deal.\n\nBut Arab officials became wary of his unpredictability, frustrated by what they considered to be limp responses to attacks on tankers in the Gulf and Saudi oil infrastructure that were blamed on Iran.\n\nHis successor Joe Biden\u2019s decision to shun Prince Mohammed and condemn abuses in the kingdom, particularly the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, then pushed relations with Riyadh to new lows.\n\nLast year, Washington\u2019s sluggish response to missile and drone attacks on Abu Dhabi by Iranian-aligned Yemeni rebels infuriated Sheikh Mohammed, who has not visited the US since 2017, and exposed the absence of personal relationships that were traditionally core to US-Gulf alliances.\n\nTensions have since eased, but there remain points of friction. In May, the UAE pulled out of a US-led maritime task force over frustrations about its rules of engagement after Iranian forces seized two tankers in the Gulf.\n\nYet for all the testiness, all sides acknowledge they need each other. The Biden administration set aside its repugnance for Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record to engage Riyadh on issues ranging from energy stability, regional policies and the Ukraine war, culminating in a frosty trip by the president to Jeddah last year. Washington has reassured Abu Dhabi of its commitment to the region\u2019s security after the UAE suspended its participation in the naval task force and dispatched additional warships and fighter jets to the Gulf.\n\nSaudi and Emirati officials also have no illusions about their dependence on the US for their main defence needs. Indeed, their demand is more not less: both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are pushing Washington to agree to more institutionalised security partnerships.\n\nThe discussions with the UAE picked up after last year\u2019s attacks on Abu Dhabi. US talks with Saudi Arabia are part of efforts to cajole the kingdom into normalising relations with Israel and, if successful, could be used by Washington to try and curb elements of Riyadh\u2019s relationship with Beijing, such as military co-operation and technology transfers.\n\nBut Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to the royal court, says that while there could be \u201cadjustments\u201d if the US\u00a0agrees to a security alliance with the kingdom, Riyadh would resist pressure to dilute ties with China.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no going back. Saudi Arabia will not give up the bridges it has built with the global south, with Russia or China, because those are integral to the functioning of the Saudi economy and to the kingdom\u2019s long term market needs,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Saudi leadership is much more independently minded; 10 years ago there was a whole generation that was just instinctively more deferential to American requests.\u201d\n\nThe war in Ukraine has underscored to the Gulf what the US is capable of when committed to a cause. But the question at the core of Emirati and Saudi concerns is the extent of Washington\u2019s commitment to their objectives.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that American economic, military or political power is less formidable today, or will be in the next 10 years, than it was in the last 10 years,\u201d says Gargash. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to understand is what is the commitment to the region and the UAE.\u201d\n\nIt is not just American military hardware that binds the Gulf to the US.\n\nThe Gulf states peg their currencies to the dollar and continue to view the US as a key investment market. More than 40 per cent of Abu Dhabi\u2019s investment fund wealth is deployed in the US. Many of Saudi Arabia\u2019s $650bn Public Investment Fund\u2019s high-profile investments have been in American assets, including stakes in Uber and electronic vehicle maker, Lucid.\n\nOfficials point out that Gulf\u2019s state funds find it much easier to invest in the US than less liberalised Asian markets, particularly at the scale required to meet their ambitions. There is also acknowledgment that much of the kind of state-of-art tech the Gulf wants to tap into is being developed by American companies.\n\nYet Gulf trade with Asia is only heading in one direction, and sovereign funds across the region are ramping up their exposure to Asian markets.\n\nIn 2021, Saudi Arabia\u2019s $81.7bn total trade with China briefly exceeded Riyadh\u2019s with the US, the UK and the euro area combined, according to a report by London-based Asia House.\n\nThe report, released last year, added that it expected the UAE to follow a similar pattern, with the difference between Gulf\u2019s state trade with China and with the US, the UK and the eurozone narrowing to a few billion dollars compared to $28bn in 2010.\n\nAnd as the world transitions away from fossil fuels, the Gulf states know it is likely to be China and India that buy their last barrels of oil.\n\nChina has not sought to challenge or displace the US\u2019s security role in the Middle East, but there are hints that it wants to move beyond traditional commercial partnerships. Its success in brokering an agreement in March for arch rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore relations was interpreted by many as a sign of Beijing\u2019s willingness to adopt a more political role in the region.\n\nHowever, Gulf officials also recognise the dangers of getting caught in the crossfire of US-China rivalry, as the two global powers aim to \u201cdecouple\u201d their economies.\n\n\u201cThis risk is in all this decoupling conversation [in Washington] because suddenly if we are looking at two competing technologies, the world is turning into VHS and Betamax,\u201d a UAE official says, a reference to home video format war in the 1980s.\n\nStill, the Gulf states are willing to rankle Washington by deepening ties with Beijing and tapping into Chinese technology, such as 5G telecommunications networks. Two years ago, the UAE was forced to address US suspicions that China was building a military base at an Abu Dhabi port.\n\nThe UAE is this month conducting its first joint air exercise with China, according to Chinese state media. It was also reported that Saudi Arabia bought $4bn of weapons from China after the Zhuhai Air Show in November, which would make it far larger than previous Saudi-Chinese arms deals.\n\nThe message to the US from Riyadh and Abu Dhabi is, \u201cWe will come to you first, but if you don\u2019t deliver we will go elsewhere,\u201d analysts say, be it weapons or technology. They add that the Gulf states are not averse to playing one country off against another. But it is a fine balance.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental strategic dilemma for them remains that their security is in the west, their energy politics is with Russia and their prosperity is increasingly with China and the rest of Asia,\u201d Hokayem says.\n\n\u201cIt requires careful footwork and constant engagement to manage these complex relationships. They have to massively invest in all those capitals, in political, economic and geoeconomic terms. It\u2019s a delicate game.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Sarah White in Paris and James Kynge in London\n\nData visualisation by Keith Fray", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3889c33d-4830-407c-a3f6-f9e3cfaaa35f"}}, {"id": "1ac3cf13-d8e0-44b5-a42f-2ff234515d18", "event_name": "Saudi Arabia and UAE race to buy Nvidia chips to power AI ambitions", "blurb": "Gulf nations acquire thousands of GPUs amid global shortage of semiconductors needed to build large language models", "date": "2023-08-1400:00:00.0", "body": "Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are buying up thousands of the high-performance Nvidia chips crucial for building artificial intelligence software, joining a global AI arms race that is squeezing the supply of Silicon Valley\u2019s hottest commodity.\n\nThe Gulf powerhouses have publicly stated their goal of becoming leaders in AI as they pursue ambitious plans to turbocharge their economies. But the push has also raised concerns about potential misuse of the technology by the oil-rich states\u2019 autocratic leaders.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the moves, Saudi Arabia has bought at least 3,000 of Nvidia\u2019s H100 chips \u2014 a $40,000 processor described by Nvidia chief Jensen Huang as \u201cthe world\u2019s first computer [chip] designed for generative AI\u201d \u2014 via the public research institution King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (Kaust).\n\nMeanwhile, the UAE has also secured access to thousands of Nvidia chips and has already developed its own open-source large language model, known as Falcon, at the state-owned Technology Innovation Institute in Masdar City, Abu Dhabi.\n\n\u201cThe UAE has made a decision that it wants to\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009own and control its own computational power and talent, have their own platforms and not be dependent on the Chinese or the Americans,\u201d said a person familiar with Abu Dhabi\u2019s thinking.\n\n\u201cImportantly, they have the capital to do it, and they have the energy resources to do that and are attracting the best global talent as well,\u201d the person added.\n\nThe Gulf states\u2019 purchases of large numbers of Nvidia chips via state-owned groups come as the world\u2019s leading tech companies rush to obtain the scarce chips for AI development.\n\nLast week the Financial Times reported that leading Chinese tech groups such as Tencent and Alibaba are seeking to buy up Nvidia\u2019s high-performance chips.\n\nThe most advanced LLMs are owned by US companies including Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google. These groups are also the primary buyers of Nvidia\u2019s H100 and A100 chips.\n\nAccording to multiple sources close to Nvidia and its manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the chipmaker will ship about 550,000 of its latest H100 chips globally in 2023, primarily to US tech companies.\u00a0Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, Kaust will receive 3,000 of these specialist chips, worth about $120mn in total, by the end of 2023, according to two people close to the university\u2019s AI labs.\n\nBy comparison, estimates suggest OpenAI trained its advanced GPT-3 model on 1,024 A100 chips \u2014 the predecessor to Nvidia\u2019s latest chips \u2014 in just over a month.\n\nThe Saudi university, which, according to people close to Kaust, also owns at least 200 A100s, is building a supercomputer, Shaheen III, that will become operational this year. The machine will run 700 Grace Hoppers, Nvidia\u2019s so-called superchips, designed for cutting-edge artificial intelligence applications.\n\nKaust will use these chips to build its own large language model \u2014 software that can generate humanlike text, images and code \u2014 similar to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, which powers the popular chatbot ChatGPT, according to multiple sources close to the state-owned university.\n\nThe Saudi LLM is being developed by the\u00a0Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics lab at Kaust, which is primarily staffed by Chinese researchers.\n\nMany Chinese nationals with AI expertise have chosen to work at Kaust because they have been prevented from studying and working in the US after graduating from Chinese universities on the US entity list, according to two Kaust sources.\n\nKaust did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, the UAE, which in 2017 was the first nation to establish an AI ministry, has launched a \u201cGenerative AI Guide\u201d as part of the government\u2019s \u201ccommitment to reinforcing its global position as a pioneer in technology and artificial intelligence sectors\u201d as well as \u201cregulatory frameworks to limit the negative use of technology\u201d.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s Falcon model, which is now freely available online, was trained on 384 A100 chips over two months earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI was extremely impressed by the model, considering the resources they used. For a while, it was among the best models in the open-source world,\u201d said one leading AI researcher and LLM expert.\n\nIt also impressed well-known venture capitalists such as Marc Andreessen, who tried to establish contact with the team, according to a UAE sovereign wealth investor. A spokesperson for Andreessen declined to comment.\n\nThe UAE government has purchased a new batch of Nvidia chips to prepare for more LLM-related applications and cloud services, according to a person at the UAE industrial development bureau.\n\nWestern AI leaders and human rights experts have raised concerns that the software developed in the two countries may lack the ethical guardrails and safety features that large tech companies are trying to build into the technology.\n\n\u201cHuman rights defenders and journalists are frequent targets of government crackdowns [in UAE and Saudi Arabia],\u201d said Iverna McGowan, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology\u2019s Europe office, in Brussels.\n\n\u201cPair this with the fact that we know how AI can have discriminatory impacts, or be used to turbocharge unlawful surveillance. It\u2019s a frightening thought,\u201d she added.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE have been buoyed by petrodollar windfalls after last year\u2019s surge in energy prices, and both manage some of the world\u2019s largest and most active sovereign investment funds.\n\nRepresentatives of Gulf state-affiliated funds have recently approached AI start-ups in the west in an effort to access code and LLM expertise in exchange for computing resources, according to the chief executives of two European AI companies, who declined their offers.\n\n\u201cWe have had offers of immense financings and access to data, in order to tap indirectly into our talent,\u201d one of the executives said.\n\nOpenAI chief executive Sam Altman in June praised Abu Dhabi\u2019s foresight in recognising the importance of AI during a visit to the region. In a question-and-answer session in the city\u2019s financial district, he said the Gulf region could \u201cplay a central role in this global conversation\u201d around the emerging technology and its regulation.\n\n\u201cThere has been discussion about AI, here in particular, in Abu Dhabi, before it was cool,\u201d he said. \u201cNow everyone is on the AI bandwagon, which we are excited about, but we have special appreciation for the people who were talking about this when everyone thought AI was not going to happen.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by George Hammond and Simeon Kerr", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c93d2a76-16f3-4585-af61-86667c5090ba"}}, {"id": "7e2dc27e-11d7-4349-9911-2a978e53c294", "event_name": "How Dubai is reshaping the global oil trade", "blurb": "Sanctions on Russian exports has led to a shift in oil trading to a new domain in the Middle East.

The agreement contained several unusual clauses that weakened Tanzania\u2019s ability to change laws, annul contracts or seek competitive bids, said lawyers.\n\nClauses that have raised concern include one that prevents withdrawal from the deal \u201cin any circumstances, including in the event of material breach, fundamental change of circumstances, severance of diplomatic or consular relations\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of agreement is this that can\u2019t be terminated,\u201d said John Nyanje, a Kenyan law expert who compared it to those imposed on countries in the global south in the 1960s. \u201cThis is not how investment treaties work.\u201d\n\nNyanje also questioned so-called \u201cstability clauses\u201d that would protect DP World from any future changes to Tanzanian law. \u201cNo reasonable country should tolerate those,\u201d he said.\n\nFatma Karume, a prominent Tanzanian lawyer, said: \u201cThe Dubai and Tanzania treaty is simply a one-way ticket. It is just to protect DP World.\u201d\n\nDP World did not provide a response, but people familiar with its thinking said critics were confusing a framework agreement between two countries with specific commercial contracts that were yet to be concluded.\n\nThe agreement was signed after a visit to Dubai by Tanzania\u2019s president Samia Suluhu Hassan at which 37 memoranda of understanding were concluded. Hassan has sought to portray Tanzania as open for investment since becoming president in 2021 following the death of John Magufuli.\n\nFreeman Mboye, chair of Chadema, Tanzania\u2019s main opposition party, who was imprisoned by Magufuli but released after Hassan took over, said the agreement gave Dubai free rein to develop seaports along Tanzania\u2019s Indian Ocean coastline as well as on lakes Victoria, Tanganyika and Nyasa, the three biggest on the continent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in Tanzania\u2019s interest and the moment you read the contract you\u2019ll see why,\u201d Mboye said.\n\nGerson Msigwa, Tanzania\u2019s government spokesman, has denied there were any problems with the intergovernmental agreement. \u201cI want to emphasise that no port has been privatised, we shall not privatise any port, and we are not selling any port,\u201d he said last month, adding that the deal was a framework for private sector collaboration and improving efficiency. Tanzania\u2019s government\u00a0did not respond to specific requests for comment.\n\nDP World operates several ports in Africa, including Berbera and Dakar, as well as a dry port in Rwanda. The company, which is majority state-owned, has been in previous controversies. Djibouti seized Doraleh port in 2018 after accusing DP World of not operating it in the country\u2019s national interest. In the UK, DP World\u2019s subsidiary P&O Ferries faced criticism over the sacking last year of hundreds of ferry staff.\n\nTanzania has previously faced criticism for bowing to Dubai\u2019s interests.

The group is pursuing deals simultaneously with Brazilian petrochemical maker Braskem, Austria\u2019s OMV and German chemical company Covestro.\n\n\u201cThey are supercharged, with the investment team given the mandate to go out and look at investments,\u201d said one banker familiar with the company. \u201cThey have pivoted from an internally focused portfolio management mindset to one that is internationally focused.\u201d\n\nThe shift marks the latest step in the transformation of Adnoc from a highly profitable but staid state oil and gas producer to a company with ambitions of building a global portfolio spanning chemicals, plastics and beyond.Jaber\u2019s appointment in January as president of this year\u2019s COP28 climate summit in the UAE has sparked heavy criticism from environmental activists as well as a group of more than 130 EU and US lawmakers who called for his removal.\n\nBut he has shaken up Adnoc in ways previously unimaginable among Gulf state oil companies, streamlining its workforce and monetising its assets.\n\nFroehlich, group chief investment officer, joined in 2020 after a more than 16-year career at Morgan Stanley, including as head of Mideast and north Africa investment banking, and three years as chief financial officer at the Saudi Binladin construction group before founding his own advisory firm.People close to the company say one attraction of working there is that while many other deals in the industry fall through, Adnoc has a record of aggressive execution.The company has earmarked $150bn in capital expenditure over the next five years towards expanding its oil and gas production, with $15bn set aside for low-carbon solutions over a longer period. It was an early mover in selling off assets and streamlining its business, taking a different approach to the region\u2019s top producer Saudi Aramco, which floated a piece of the entire company. In 2019 Adnoc sold off stakes in its pipelines to BlackRock and KKR in a $4bn move to fund development that was part of a broader plan to generate cash from existing assets and partner with blue-chip international groups.Over the past two years it has floated five subsidiaries at a roughly $140bn combined market capitalisation. \u201cThey\u2019re increasingly thinking more like an investment manager and, like the UAE itself, want to build a bigger global footprint,\u201d said Raad Alkadiri at Eurasia Group. \u201cPart of it is ambition, part of it is prestige, but part is how do you manage your own fortune rather than leaving it to the whims of the energy transition.\u201d\n\nDespite Jaber\u2019s jam-packed schedule this year as he jets around the world to build support for COP28, deals involving Adnoc keep stacking up.\n\nNot only is the company seeking a \u20ac13bn takeover of Covestro and in the midst of a nearly $8bn joint bid for Braskem alongside US investor Apollo, it is also working on an ambitious plan to merge its chemicals division with that of Austria\u2019s OMV in what could be a more than $30bn deal.Meanwhile, it has teamed up with BP to launch a $2bn bid for a 50 per cent stake in an Israeli natural gas group as part of a plan to jointly pursue gas projects in the eastern Mediterranean. On Friday it announced it had taken a 30 per cent stake in an Azerbaijan gasfield, giving the group a foothold in pipeline supplies to the EU.\u201cThey see a huge amount of capital required in the energy sector, a lot of people not investing sufficiently, and a big opportunity for a company that\u2019s investing aggressively,\u201d said Robin Mills, a Middle East energy expert and chief executive of Qamar Energy.\u201cThis is the new Adnoc and it\u2019s much more aggressive and innovative than it ever used to be,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile Adnoc has built out extensive internal capabilities, it still works with external advisers, including Wall Street banks, according to people familiar with the matter.The company must navigate complex dynamics to seal some of its acquisitions. Under the OMV deal the Austrian group\u2019s chemicals arm Borealis would be combined with Borouge, the chemicals company majority owned by Adnoc and listed in Abu Dhabi. Each side holds stakes in the other but under an announced framework OMV said the aim would be to become \u201cequal partners under a jointly controlled, listed platform for potential growth acquisitions\u201d. The talks have been \u201cquite start-stop\u201d, according to a person familiar with the matter, but both sides are motivated by the prospect of creating a new market leader by sharing technology and combining expertise in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe two sides must reach an agreement on a valuation for the unlisted Borealis, which could be valued at about $10bn, while Borouge trades at a market capitalisation of about $22bn. Other issues to be hammered out include where the merged business would be listed and headquartered. Covestro, meanwhile, has rebuffed a \u20ac13bn approach from Adnoc, prompting the state group to raise its offer.\n\nJaber is also using dealmaking to strengthen Adnoc\u2019s renewables business. His company has taken a stake in Masdar, the Emirati renewable energy company that he helped launch in 2006, with plans to further its growth.\n\n\u201cIn terms of their strategic thinking they are generally way ahead of most other state energy companies when it comes to thinking about their place in the energy transition,\u201d said Amrita Sen at Energy Aspects. \u201cBut their ability\u00a0to execute on their strategy is yet to be fully tested.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Arash Massoudi\n\n", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f9f2676b-db78-4e7c-88d6-22e32c849687"}}, {"id": "9fd0d571-4066-4035-94db-3f032e01ad98", "event_name": "Lure of sovereign wealth fuels hedge fund rush to Dubai", "blurb": "Low tax and booming internal job market helps emirate cement position as a global industry hub", "date": "2023-08-0900:00:00.0", "body": "A growing number of top hedge funds are setting up shop in Dubai, as the lure of low taxes and the region\u2019s deep-pocketed investors cements the emirate\u2019s status as an industry hub.\n\nQuant investing giant AQR, and multi-strategy firms such as Sculptor and Lighthouse Investment Partners are among the hedge funds to establish a presence in the city over the past year, according to regulatory disclosures and industry sources.\n\nThe moves highlight how the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic has added impetus to the Dubai authorities\u2019 two-decade push to become the regional base for the hedge fund industry. Of the 40 funds registered in the emirate as of July, more than a third arrived in the past 12 months, according to figures from the Dubai International Financial Centre. The majority are London or New York-based firms opening subsidiaries.\n\nExecutives and traders say the absence of personal income tax in the United Arab Emirates has left the city well-placed in an escalating war for hedge fund talent which has seen in-demand portfolio managers offered millions of dollars in signing bonuses.\n\nBut hedge fund executives also admit a local presence is as much a long-term business decision and signal to the region\u2019s influential and wealthy state-backed investors.\n\n\u201cThe sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and the UAE are an important source of capital for hedge funds so there has always been a need to travel there,\u201d said Sean McGould, chief executive officer and chief investment officer at Lighthouse, which opened the doors of its Dubai office in April and has one employee based there. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have an office there to show commitment on the ground.\u201d\n\nIndustry insiders said the number of hedge funds in Dubai is nearing a critical mass that has made it feasible to hire from competitors in the region, rather than trying to attract talent from abroad.\n\n\u201cDubai has reached a certain size and scale where there are now intra-hedge fund moves,\u201d said an executive at a multibillion-dollar family office that has a base in Dubai.\n\nCredit specialist hedge fund King Street Capital Management, which has $23bn under management, opened its Dubai office in March, though its presence is still small. Managing director Reda Zebdi is the only employee in the office for now but the hedge fund said it intended to grow \u201cnaturally\u201d over the coming years.\n\n\u201cSince Covid, many firms, including King Street, have tried to move closer to investors in the region\u201d he said. \u201cWhen an ecosystem is building and building fast we want to be part of it.\u201d\n\nHe added that in addition to supporting clients, the firm was looking at local investment opportunities.\n\nIzzy Englander\u2019s Millennium Management was one of the first big US hedge funds to move to the city when it hired a Dubai-based portfolio manager in 2020. The near $60bn-in-assets firm now has about 50 people working there, the majority of whom are investment professionals, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nMillennium declined to comment.\n\nThe talent war among so-called multi-strategy firms \u2014 the hedge fund giants that increasingly dominate the industry \u2014 has led others to follow suit. Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 Asset Management, ExodusPoint Capital Management and more recently Balyasny Asset Management have all opened Dubai offices.\n\nBalyasny, which has $21bn under management, plans to have 10 teams led by portfolio managers on the ground by the end of the year, according to a person familiar with the matter. However, not every member of the PM teams will necessarily move to Dubai.\n\nBut the shift to the UAE isn\u2019t just about tax and raising capital. Dubai and Abu Dhabi are increasingly seen by wealthy hedge funders as attractive alternative cities to London, New York and Hong Kong after the pandemic.\n\nHedge fund firms say that they saw an increase in inquiries from employees keen to relocate to the Middle East during government-mandated lockdowns in Europe and the US. Dubai\u2019s Covid restrictions were much less harsh compared with traditional hedge fund centres such as London and Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cWe were actually open in Dubai because it had a very short lockdown stint and as a result we became an interesting option for a large number of portfolio managers,\u201d said a senior employee at one large hedge fund.\n\nThe city is not the only one in UAE to benefit from the hedge fund rush. UK macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, which has $33bn in assets, announced earlier this year that it was opening an office in Abu Dhabi.\n\nCo-founder Trifon Natsis and chief compliance officer Ryan Taylor have both moved to the city. The firm wants to hire more than 100 people there over the next 12 months, according to a person familiar with its strategy.\n\nDubai\u2019s geographical position, straddling the European and Asian trading days, has helped.\n\n\u201cThis is the perfect timezone,\u201d said an executive at a large fund that has just opened an office in the UAE. \u201cYou can absorb what happened in Asia close and prepare very well for European open.\u201d\n\nDespite the rush to the Gulf, London and New York remain by far the largest centres of the global hedge fund industry, and so far no major hedge fund has moved its headquarters to the UAE. But for portfolio managers keen to maximise their earnings, it has become a popular alternative destination.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a compelling draw for people, especially if you\u2019re used to constant strikes in London, a high tax burden and public services being severely impacted,\u201d the executive added. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see the real buzz and enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nThis article has been amended to reflect that registration figures were provided by the Dubai International Financial Centre", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/80d1538c-3ac9-48c7-bf2c-b54635d32c5c"}}, {"id": "1eafb6c7-fbbc-4d37-a844-b8b6b11e66d4", "event_name": "UK ordered to apologise to academic over alleged torture in UAE", "blurb": "Parliamentary ombudsman attacks \u2018profound failure\u2019 of embassy staff to spot signs of alleged mistreatment", "date": "2023-08-0300:00:00.0", "body": "The UK government was on Thursday ordered to apologise and pay \u00a31,500 in compensation to a\u00a0British academic imprisoned in the United Arab Emirates and allegedly tortured in 2018, causing a rupture between London and its Gulf ally.\n\nThe parliamentary ombudsman said there was a \u201cprofound failure\u201d by British embassy staff in missing signs of potential torture when they visited Matthew Hedges, a doctoral candidate at Durham university, in prison in the UAE.\n\nHedges was arrested at Dubai airport in early May 2018 on suspicion of being a British spy after conducting research for his PhD thesis on military developments following the Arab Spring. He was given a life sentence in November the same year, only to be pardoned days later as his case threatened to derail the country\u2019s close ties with Britain.\n\nFollowing his release the relationship between the two governments has improved, although both sides continue to disagree over the true nature of Hedges\u2019 role in Abu Dhabi.\n\nHedges said he was interrogated for up to 15 hours a day, kept in solitary confinement and forcibly administered with medication after being sentenced to life in jail. The UAE has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Hedges.\n\nThe academic, who has previously criticised the government\u2019s failure to launch a promised inquiry after he returned to the UK, said he was supervised at all times by prison guards who told him what he was allowed to say when he was visited by embassy officials in 2018.\n\nHe made an official complaint to the ombudsman, accusing the Foreign Office of failing to follow its own guidance on detecting potential torture and mistreatment. The ombudsman noted that Hedges\u2019 voice was audibly shaking when British embassy staff came to visit him and that he avoided making eye contact and told them he was having panic attacks.\n\nForeign Office guidelines state that staff should act on warning signs of mental and physical stress of British detainees even when the officials do not have the consent of the individual. The ombudsman found that Foreign Office staff should have been aware that Hedges was not in a position to consent.\n\nRebecca Hilsenrath, the ombudsman\u2019s chief executive, said it was \u201chard to imagine\u201d what Hedges endured and that his \u201cnightmare was made even worse by being failed by the British government\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe have asked the [Foreign Office] to make sure it will fully use all its powers to protect British citizens abroad and ensure that they are there precisely when they are most needed,\u201d she said. The ombudsman also called on the government to apologise to Hedges and pay him \u00a31,500 in compensation.\n\nThe UK government said it would review the ombudsman\u2019s findings and respond in due course. \u201cThe best interests of British nationals, including those detained overseas, is at the heart of our consular work and we support their families wherever we can,\u201d it said.\n\nThe UAE government said allegations of mistreatment of Hedges were categorically false and lacked any evidentiary basis. \u201cHis claims of being \u2018tortured\u2019 while in UAE custody are wholly untrue and without any foundation whatsoever,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cMr Hedges received entirely proper care and treatment.

These represent the majority of the emissions linked to fossil fuel consumption, which most European oil majors, including BP and Shell, have set targets to cut.\n\nAdnoc framed the new targets as evidence of its ambition to play a leading role in cutting the emissions associated with fossil fuel production, despite its plans to increase oil output this decade.\n\n\u201cThese targets mark a new chapter in Adnoc\u2019s transformational journey to a lower-carbon future,\u201d it said.\n\nIt aims to cut scope 1 and 2 emissions by powering more of its oil and gas production with renewable energy, and capturing and storing 5mn tonnes of carbon emissions a year by 2030.\n\nAdnoc in January said it would allocate $15bn to \u201cdecarbonisation initiatives\u201d such as carbon capture and storage, electrification and energy efficiency between 2023 and 2027, representing approximately 10 per cent of the total capital spending during the period.\n\nOn Monday, it said it would make additional investments in the \u201ccoming months\u201d to help meet its updated decarbonisation targets.\n\nAdnoc also released details of its carbon emissions for the first time. Last year the total scope 1 and 2 emissions from its oil and gas production was approximately 24mn tonnes of CO\u2082 equivalent, representing about 7kg of CO\u2082 per barrel of oil equivalent, which was one of the lowest carbon intensity levels in the world, it said.\n\nGulf rival Saudi Aramco emits about 10kg of CO\u2082e/boe, while BP emits about 15kg of CO\u2082e/boe.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a5830466-0167-4edc-aa9d-2442632dce35"}}, {"id": "e10bc883-9ab2-40d6-a733-29e833caecb9", "event_name": "US security officials scrutinise Abu Dhabi\u2019s $3bn Fortress takeover", "blurb": "Cfius previously intervened on SoftBank\u2019s acquisition of the US investment firm ", "date": "2023-07-2500:00:00.0", "body": "US national security officials are scrutinising an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund\u2019s planned $3bn takeover of New York-based Fortress Investment Group amid concerns in Washington over the United Arab Emirates\u2019 ties to China, people close to the situation told the Financial Times.\n\nThe review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an inter-governmental agency that vets whether deals can harm national security, is in its early stages and a decision is not expected for several months, the people added.\n\nAbu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala agreed to buy a majority stake in Fortress, which manages about $46bn in assets and specialises in distressed debt investing, in May from Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group. Mubadala, which is run by chief executive Khaldoon al-Mubarak, said it intended to close the deal in the first quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nMubadala and Fortress declined to comment. The US Treasury, which oversees the Cfius process, said it did not comment on transactions that it \u201cmay or not be reviewing\u201d but added that it was \u201ccommitted to taking all necessary actions within its authority to safeguard US national security\u201d.\n\nThe Cfius action comes as the Biden administration steps up scrutiny of China-related investment and prepares to unveil an executive order that would require US companies investing in certain sensitive sectors \u2014 including semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum computing \u2014 to notify the federal government. It would also prohibit investment in certain areas.\n\nThe FT previously revealed that Cfius, which can require steps to mitigate its concerns or block a deal outright, intervened in SoftBank\u2019s 2017 takeover of Fortress. Cfius forced SoftBank to relinquish day-to-day control over Fortress and took further steps to monitor SoftBank\u2019s level of direct influence on the investment firm.\n\nAt the time, the FT reported that Cfius was concerned about some of SoftBank\u2019s investments, which included a large stake in China\u2019s Alibaba Group, and the business links of its founder Masayoshi Son.\n\nMubadala acquired a near 10 per cent stake in Fortress in 2019 and received Cfius clearance for that purchase, according to people with knowledge of that review. However, a new review is needed for its plan to purchase a further 60 per cent in Fortress, the people added. As part of the deal, Fortress insiders would own the remaining 30 per cent with a special class of shares that allows them to appoint a majority of its board.\n\nMubadala has other investments in the US, which include a stake in US private equity firm Silver Lake thanks to close relations between its co-chief executive Egon Durban and Mubarak.\n\nOne expert in the Cfius process told the FT that there were likely two reasons the inter-agency body will take a close look at the planned Fortress takeover, including growing concerns in Washington over budding relations between Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, and China.\n\n\u201cWhat we are also witnessing in the pendulum swinging back to where sovereign wealth funds are under increased scrutiny,\u201d the person said, referring to the period after Cfius investigated a deal for Dubai Ports World to buy P&O, the UK-based port operator.\n\nCfius approved the deal in 2006, but following uproar from US politicians, including then-senator Hillary Clinton, the UAE compelled DP World to relinquish control of five port terminals in the US that it acquired in its purchase of P&O.\n\nThe US concern was not about China, but about its ports being vulnerable to terrorist attacks. US lawmakers alleged that Dubai was a transfer point for nuclear-related components to Iran, Libya and North Korea.\n\nThe Biden administration has been concerned about indications that China was building a military facility at Khalifa Port in UAE, as part of an effort to project military power. China has one international base, located in Djibouti, and is building another naval facility in Cambodia.\n\nIn September last year, President Joe Biden also issued an order telling Cfius to pay close attention to deals involving critical technologies, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology.

The fund also said it would provide $3bn in export credit financing to Turkish companies to boost bilateral trade.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the estimated $50bn value of all the agreements was calculated. But the deals mark a deepening of ties between regional powers that have spent much of the past decade at loggerheads, often backing rival sides during the turmoil that erupted across the Middle East after the 2011 popular Arab uprisings.\n\nErdo\u011fan, who held talks with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, said the agreements would \u201celevate our relations to the level of strategic partnership\u201d.\n\nThe Turkish leader has this week visited Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE to drum up support and investment for Turkey\u2019s economy after he appointed a new economic team following his victory in May elections.\n\nHis government has returned to more orthodox economic policies after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s management of the economy was widely blamed for pushing the lira to record lows against the dollar, fuelling soaring inflation and scaring off foreign investors.\n\nBankers said Erdo\u011fan took with him on his tour of the Gulf a list of assets in which Turkey is seeking to sell stakes as Ankara looks to raise foreign currency to replenish severely depleted reserves and manage a yawning current account deficit.\n\nThe UAE, the Gulf\u2019s trade and finance hub, has also over the past two years shifted away from its more assertive foreign policy towards what officials describe as economic diplomacy as it faces increasing competition from neighbouring Saudi Arabia.\n\nA Gulf-based banker said Emirati officials sent out an \u201call-points bulletin\u201d to bankers in the UAE ahead of Erdogan\u2019s visit \u201cto be ready and help us on ideas and be ready to execute\u201d.\n\nThe rapprochement between Abu Dhabi and Ankara began two years ago, after Sheikh Mohammed held talks with Erdo\u011fan in the Turkish capital.\n\nAt the time, ADQ committed to invest $10bn in Turkey and had previously backed Turkish start-ups Getir, a grocery delivery company, and Trendyol, the country\u2019s largest ecommerce firm.\n\nSheikh Mohammed visited Turkey again in June, and bankers say there is now greater clarity for investments with the new economic team in place. Led by finance minister Mehmet \u015eim\u015fek, this group has strong ties across the Gulf and has begun to reverse Erdogan\u2019s controversial policies.\n\nAnalysts say the Gulf, which is home to some of the world\u2019s largest sovereign investment funds, was an obvious starting point for Erdo\u011fan in his bid to rally support for the economy, as many western investors remain wary about the president\u2019s commitment to more orthodox policies.\n\nAfter Erdo\u011fan held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman this week, Riyadh and Ankara struck an agreement for Saudi Arabia to buy Turkish drones in what was described as Turkey\u2019s largest ever defence export deal.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/63c1282c-ccc1-43d6-b4bf-240b11255676"}}, {"id": "e6c97d02-f372-4f8c-a2f7-4f8ab81caace", "event_name": "How Dubai became \u2018the new Geneva\u2019 for Russian oil trade", "blurb": "When Switzerland joined sanctions against Moscow, a chunk of the world\u2019s oil trade relocated to the Middle East.

But since Switzerland joined the embargo imposed on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine much of that trade has shifted to Dubai and other cities in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nCompanies registered in the small Gulf state bought at least 39mn tonnes of Russian oil worth more than $17bn between January and April \u2014 around a third of the country\u2019s exports declared to customs during that period \u2014 according to Russian customs documentation analysed by the Financial Times.\n\nSome of that oil ended up in the UAE, ship-tracking data shows, landing at storage terminals in places such as Fujairah. The rest \u2014 about 90 per cent \u2014 never touched Emirati soil, instead flowing from Russian ports directly to new buyers in Asia, Africa and South America as part of one of the biggest redirections of global energy flows in history.\n\nThe energy trading industry in the UAE was already growing before Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. But the conflict, and the western sanctions that followed it, have supercharged that growth.\n\nOut of the top 20 traders of Russian crude in the first four months of the year, eight were registered in the UAE, the customs data shows. In refined petroleum products, such as diesel and fuel oil, UAE dominance was even higher, with 10 of the 20 largest traders registered in the country.\n\nThe trading boom has further enriched the nation, moving billions of dollars of additional oil revenue through its banks and attracting dozens of new companies to its free-trade zones. It has also tested relations with allies such as the US, which wants Russian oil to flow but is wary of creating new trade routes that undermine sanctions.\n\nExecutives at trading houses say Dubai, the UAE\u2019s main commercial centre, is a heady mix of excitement, competition and suspicion as new trading teams battle for talent and trade flow in a market suddenly rife with buyers and sellers.\n\n\u201cIf you are an oil trader, this is where you want to be,\u201d says Matt Stanley, a former trader and 20-year industry veteran who now manages client relationships in the region for data provider Kpler. \u201cDubai is the new Geneva.\u201d\n\nThe UAE, which juts from the Arabian peninsula into the Gulf of Oman, has been an important commercial hub for centuries, attracting merchants who shuttled goods between Europe and Asia. In recent years it has become a major trading location for gold, diamonds and agricultural commodities, such as tea and coffee, helped by its modern business infrastructure, banking services and light-touch regulation.\n\nThe UAE is the world\u2019s eighth-largest oil producer, but historically has not been a major oil trading location. Volumes were modest and Adnoc, Abu Dhabi\u2019s state oil company, only set up its own trading arm three years ago.\n\nHowever, the country\u2019s proximity to growing oil markets in Africa and Asia and the absence of personal income taxes had started to attract more profit-hungry traders even before the war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the last locations in the world to live and not pay tax,\u201d says the chief financial officer of one trading house. Traders in his group\u2019s other offices around the world are now regularly requesting moves to Dubai, he adds. \u201cThis will become the global commodity trading hub.\u201d\n\nAnother attraction is the UAE\u2019s perceived political neutrality in a world where rivalries between global powers mean Russia is unlikely to be the last country to face European or US sanctions on its exports.\n\n\u201cThe UAE gives you that platform to transact, trade and travel freely,\u201d says the chief executive of an energy trading company set up in Dubai in the past five years.\n\nBut for all the UAE\u2019s success in building modern business infrastructure and capitalising on its geographical location, it is the war in Ukraine and the UAE\u2019s willingness to welcome Russian businesses that are driving the current boom. \u201cThe Ukraine crisis put it on steroids,\u201d the chief executive says.\n\nThe Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, in the city\u2019s gleaming Jumeirah Lake Towers district, is one of the UAE\u2019s biggest and most successful free zones. A three-dimensional model in the lobby of the headquarters displays the district\u2019s 87 gleaming residential and commercial towers across its two-square-km site, home to 22,000 registered companies.\n\nIt is also, arguably, the new centre of the Russian oil trading universe. Out of the 104 buyers of Russian oil listed on Russian customs declarations between January and April, at least 25 were companies registered in the DMCC.\n\nLitasco Middle East DMCC accounted for most of the near-16mn tonnes of Russian crude and refined fuels traded by the Lukoil-owned group between January and April, making it the biggest single buyer of Russian oil during the period, according to the customs data.\n\nThe company previously had only a representative office in the UAE, but some of its trading operations moved from Geneva to Dubai last year.\u00a0One former Litasco trader says the group had taken over an entire floor in a high-rise tower at the heart of the free zone.\n\nSwitzerland-headquartered Litasco SA said that following a reorganisation last year, Litasco Middle East was \u201cno longer a subsidiary\u201d of Litasco in Geneva. The Swiss entity \u201chas very limited volumes of crude oil and refined products from Russia, according to the exemptions from the embargo on Russian production given by the EU,\u201d it added.\n\nDMCC-registered Demex Trading and Qamah Logistics are also among the larger traders of Russian crude. Both were incorporated during the past three years; neither could be reached for comment.\n\nTrading Russian oil from Dubai is not illegal. Western sanctions only prohibit imports into the EU, UK and other countries enforcing the G7\u2019s rules, such as Switzerland. Under the restrictions western companies can also continue selling Russian oil to other parts of the world if that oil is sold under a certain price.\n\nThe measures have been designed to keep Russian oil flowing to new non-western buyers, while reducing the revenue flowing to the Kremlin. Washington has even encouraged traders to keep moving Russian oil to avoid supply disruptions, provided they trade below the relevant price cap.\n\nWhile Dubai-registered traders are not obliged to comply with the price cap, some have chosen to do so in order to maintain access to western services such as shipping, banking and insurance.\n\nGeneva-based Gunvor, for example, has said it incorporated a second entity in Dubai in October to segregate \u201cthe handling and financing of any potential Russia-related deals\u201d from the rest of its trading activities.\n\nGunvor had ceased trading Russian crude but bought about $330mn of Russian refined fuels between January and April, all in compliance with the west\u2019s sanctions and price cap policy, it told the FT in June. It disputed some of the customs data, which showed exports by Gunvor worth over $500mn during the period.Helima Croft, a former CIA analyst and global head of commodities research at RBC Capital Markets, says Washington does not mind where Russian oil is traded from provided it is done transparently. \u201cAs long as these Russian barrels are below the cap, these trading houses are doing nothing wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s Washington\u2019s price cap plan in action.\u201d\n\nOther traders, however, appear to be using Dubai-based subsidiaries to legally buy and sell oil above the cap by employing non-European shipping and financial service providers.\n\nParamount Energy and Commodities, for example, transferred its Russian trading activity last year from Geneva to a DMCC-registered subsidiary, which has continued to market a crude blend from eastern Russia that has consistently traded above the G7\u2019s $60-a-barrel cap, according to pricing data. Swiss authorities questioned the trader in April about its switch to Dubai, the FT reported in July.\n\nParamount said at the time that it had responded to the questions in full, informing the regulator that the Swiss entity had ceased all transactions involving Russian oil before the price cap took effect and that its UAE affiliate was a separate legal entity with different directors.\n\nThe biggest contributors to Dubai\u2019s Russian oil boom, however, are not established players but a network of previously unknown companies with opaque ownership structures that are collectively moving billions of dollars of oil a month.\n\nAmong the largest traders of both crude oil and refined fuels from Russia is a company called Tejarinaft FZCO, registered in another free zone called Dubai Silicon Oasis.\n\nTejarinaft \u2014 \u201coil trade\u201d in Arabic \u2014 was incorporated two months after the Russian invasion. Corporate records list Hicham Fizazi, a Moroccan national, as the sole director and the general manager. He is the only named shareholder, although the records do not disclose whether he owns all or part of the company.\n\nCorporate records reviewed by the FT also list Fizazi as the sole director and only named shareholder of at least two other UAE-registered companies trading Russian oil: Amur Trading FZCO, registered in Dubai Silicon Oasis in August, and Amur Investments Ltd, registered in Abu Dhabi in September.\n\nRival traders say they had never heard of Fizazi before last year. They believe the three companies are part of a network set up by, or on behalf of, Rosneft to help the Kremlin-controlled producer to move its oil after European former partners such as Trafigura and Vitol stepped away from trading Russian crude last year.\n\nCustoms declarations suggest that Tejarinaft, Amur Trading and Amur Investments have only ever exported oil from Rosneft or Rosneft projects, trading almost $8bn of Russian crude and refined fuels from the producer between September and April.\n\nTejarinaft alone exported $6.71bn of Russian oil between September and March, exclusively for Rosneft, according to the 394 customs declarations during the period.\n\nRosneft did not respond to a request for comment. Emails to the address provided on Tejarinaft\u2019s website bounced back as undeliverable, the telephone number listed there connected to a general inquiries line for the free zone while the online \u201ccontact us\u201d form did not work. Amur Trading and Amur Investments could not be reached.\n\nBen Higgins, a Dubai-based investigations specialist at risk consultancy Wallbrook, part of Anthesis, says he has seen a big increase in requests from banks and other corporate clients for further diligence on Dubai-registered trading companies over the past year.\n\n\u201cIncorporated across various Dubai free zones, the target entities are often very low profile and their owners \u2014 on paper \u2014 aren\u2019t Russian nationals,\u201d he says. \u201cDeeper research and analysis, however, often find multiple leads back to Russia.\u201d\n\nSome of the individuals Wallbrook has investigated also appear to have played similar roles in businesses dealing with oil from Iran or Venezuela, Higgins says, \u201calways a hop ahead of the authorities, shuffling between hotspots such as Cyprus, Hong Kong, Latvia\u00a0and\u00a0Dubai\u201d.\n\nWhile the Russian oil trading business is scattered across Dubai\u2019s sparkling high-rise offices, the heart of the physical trade is 100km east at the dusty port city of Fujairah.\n\nThe Fujairah Oil Industry Zone (FOIZ) is the largest commercial storage facility in the region for refined oil products. The site\u2019s 262 towering white storage tanks stretch for several kilometres along either side of the road from the port. Right now many of them are filled to the brim with oil, much of it from Russia.\n\nMonthly imports of Russian fuels into Fujairah increased from nothing in April 2022 to a peak of 141,000 barrels a day during December. According to Pamela Munger, an oil analyst at data provider Vortexa, that represented 40 per cent of all fuel flowing into the terminal that month. Last month, Fujairah received an average of 105,000 barrels a day from Russia, the data shows.\n\nThe influx has driven up the prices operators can charge for storage but also created a \u201ctwo tier market, where those tanks willing to take Russian product can charge a premium,\u201d one Dubai-based oil trader said. FOIZ did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nVTTI, which is partly owned by Vitol, is one of a handful of western companies operating storage tanks at Fujairah. VTTI said it did accept Russian fuels into its tanks and stressed that \u201cthere are no sanctions in UAE with regards to Russian products, nor are western sanctions applicable to the UAE\u201d.\n\n\u201cHence, product owners are allowed to move and trade Russian products into and through UAE\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and storage companies are allowed to store Russian product in the UAE,\u201d it said. Even if a cargo was required to comply with the G7\u2019s price cap \u2014 for example, because it had been bought or sold by a western company or had used western shipping or insurance services \u2014 those restrictions did not apply to the storage provider, it added.\n\nA further sign of the boom in activity at Fujairah was the purchase in May by Dubai-based newcomer Montfort of an oil refinery in the FOIZ previously owned by German utility Uniper. Montfort, set up by former Trafigura trader Rashad Kussad in 2021, outbid several companies including Vitol, which owns a neighbouring facility, according to three people familiar with the deal.\n\nMontfort declined to comment further on the deal, adding that its commodity trading activities at Fujairah, and elsewhere in the world, comply with \u201call applicable laws, regulations, and sanctions, including those of the EU, Switzerland, UK and US\u201d.\n\nSuch investments in physical infrastructure may have been precipitated by the war in Ukraine, but they also reflect a growing belief in the UAE that even if the Russian-fuelled boom eventually wanes, the global oil trading landscape has been changed forever.\n\n\u201cPeople put the cause as the Russian situation, but that was just the start of it,\u201d says one UAE-based trading executive, who now expects European commodity bankers to follow the traders to Dubai as Emirati banks seek to expand their service offering for the sector.\n\nFor Russian oil, as for many Russian nationals, Dubai has proved to be a welcoming, but potentially temporary, home while the war in Ukraine continues. For the scores of expatriate oil traders manning trading desks across the city, the move looks more permanent.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer a transitory environment, where you say: \u2018I\u2019ll try my luck and if I lose money I\u2019ll hand back the keys and fly back to Europe\u2019,\u201d says Kpler\u2019s Stanley. \u201cPeople are now setting up roots here. People have got faith in the system.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Anastasia Stognei in Riga and Chris Cook in London\n\nThis article has been amended to incorporate information provided by Litasco SA since publication.

The United Arab Emirates, which has close ties to the US and Russia, has remained neutral in the conflict, saying it welcomed non-sanctioned Russians.\n\nThe Russian population of the UAE has risen fivefold since the invasion to as many as 500,000, according to unofficial estimates circling in the expatriate community.\n\n\u201cRussian demand is still strong, but now mainly in the ultra-luxury segment,\u201d said Inga Brykulska, an agent with Driven Properties who has helped Russians families switch to Dubai. \u201cMany are relocating from places such as Switzerland and Great Britain.

Adnoc, under the leadership of Sultan al-Jaber, who is also in charge of UAE\u2019s hosting of the COP28 climate summit, has sought to maximise the value of the Gulf state\u2019s resources by expanding in downstream production.\n\nThe oil company has also been trying to make its large energy-intensive plants less dependent on fossil fuels, investing in green technologies and recycling solutions that are increasingly attractive as demand grows for less environmentally hazardous components.\n\nThe rise in energy prices that has buoyed fossil fuel companies has presented the opposite challenge to chemical companies such as Covestro. In March, the company warned that profits this year would be \u201cwell below\u201d those in 2022.Last year, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were \u20ac1.6bn, almost half the figure from the year before. \u201cThe sharp rise in energy and raw material prices during the year, especially in Europe, put a strain on the company,\u201d Covestro said at the time.\n\nThe European gas crisis, which hit Germany particularly hard, prompted concern about the future of energy-intensive industries such as chemicals on the continent.

The problem is not simply fossil fuel emissions. It\u2019s fossil fuels \u2014 period,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cWe are hurtling towards disaster, eyes wide open, with far too many willing to bet it all on wishful thinking, unproven technologies and silver bullet solutions.\u201d\n\nGuterres noted that for every dollar the industry spent on oil and gas drilling and exploration, only 4c went to clean energy and carbon capture combined. \u201cTrading the future for thirty pieces of silver is immoral,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added on Thursday that his comments were \u201cnot aimed at any one individual\u201d but were an appeal to \u201cthose who have the power to change\u201d, urging fossil fuel companies to shift their entire business to renewable energy.\n\nThe remarks come five months before the petrostate UAE is due to host COP28 in Dubai, led by Jaber. More than 130 US lawmakers and members of the European parliament wrote to UN officials and others last month to request the UAE withdraw Jaber from the role, arguing that his position as head of the state oil company risked \u201cundermining the negotiations\u201d.\n\nThe halfway point to COP28 was marked on Thursday in Bonn, Germany, with the conclusion of discussions over an agenda. Countries were deadlocked until the penultimate day, when they finally managed to agree on what issues might be carried over for consideration at COP28.\n\nWhile the EU had proposed an agenda item about work to cut emissions, it was ultimately not included following pushback from a group of oil and gas producing nations including Saudi Arabia. Instead, the discussions on the issue at Bonn will be recorded in a \u201cnote\u201d, to inform the talks at COP28.\n\nPakistani co-chair of the Bonn talks, Nabeel Munir, at one point warned the negotiators that all their work would be wasted if an agenda was not officially adopted, accusing them of acting like a \u201cprimary school class\u201d.

That follows years of pressure by campaigners demanding greater transparency at UN climate negotiations over concerns about fossil fuel industry lobbying.\n\nProgress at Bonn is considered a key milestone in negotiations ahead of COP28. Climate experts had hoped that the UAE presidency would outline its vision for the Dubai summit, and expressed disappointment on Thursday.\n\nWhile Jaber took a step further than before to say at a meeting in Bonn that the phase down of fossil fuels was inevitable, this did not include a timeline or a plan for ending new oil and gas production.\n\nWhether the COP28 presidency would allow countries to have an \u201copen and transparent discussion\u201d about including a commitment to phasing down fossil fuels in the final COP decision text remained the key question, said Alden Meyer, from the think-tank E3G.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/250781d1-4cd1-4dc1-a0cf-97433074305a"}}, {"id": "7fe8e119-439f-41f4-950f-f06ce4c85b1f", "event_name": "UN climate summit organisers wage public relations battle", "blurb": "Marketing drive for multimillion-dollar sponsorships for UAE-hosted event as critics become more vocal", "date": "2023-06-1100:00:00.0", "body": "UN climate conference organisers are pitching for top corporate sponsors for the Dubai summit at the same time as the United Arab Emirates attempts to combat rising criticism of the petrostate\u2019s leadership of COP28.\n\nThe UAE COP28 has offered sponsorship packages ranging up to $8.2mn (Dh30mn) for a principal partner to enjoy privileged access in the controlled \u201cblue zone\u201d where world leaders gather, according to documents sent to prospective sponsors.

Advocacy groups have called for the release of dozens of political dissidents detained since 2012, many of whom remain imprisoned despite having completed their sentences.\u00a0The authorities brand the detainees as a terrorist threat, activists have said.\n\nJaber, an engineer by background who is trusted by Abu Dhabi\u2019s leadership as one of its most effective technocrats, is known as being

force\u2019s mandate and rules of engagement.\n\n\u201cFor example, what was it [the force] doing when it saw Iranian forces interdict a ship transiting from a UAE port?\u201d the person said. \u201cThe point of the task force is to protect maritime navigation and security and you can\u2019t do that unless it has the mandate to intervene.\u201d\n\nThe US Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet declined to comment.\n\nAfter holding talks with Sullivan, Sheikh Tahnoon \u201cpraised\u201d the US defence partnership with the UAE, the readout said.\n\nThe US-UAE relationship has been tense since January 2022, when Iranian-allied Houthi militia in Yemen launched missile and drone attacks on Abu Dhabi.*\n\nThe UAE leadership felt that Washington was slow to react to the attacks on the Gulf state\u2019s capital, in contrast with other partners, such as France.\n\nAbu Dhabi viewed the response as further evidence of what it perceives to be a decade of US disengagement from the region and policy unpredictability.\n\nThe UAE was also disappointed by US responses to sabotage attacks against commercial shipping in the Gulf of Oman and missile attacks on critical Saudi oil infrastructure in 2019 that were blamed on Iran.\n\nThe Islamic republic has hijacked commercial shipping vessels in and around the Gulf in recent years.\n\nSince the attacks on Abu Dhabi two years ago, both sides have been working on developing an enhanced security partnership but have yet to reach an agreement.\n\nWhile the UAE is seeking a pact around security protection, Washington has raised issues around Abu Dhabi\u2019s close ties to other powers, including China, which is emerging as a more influential force in the oil-rich region.\n\nIn March, Beijing brokered a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran under which the two regional powerhouses agreed to restore diplomatic relations.\n\nThe UAE has also attracted many Russians and their assets in the wake of the Ukrainian war, raising concerns in the west that the Gulf\u2019s financial capital could emerge as a haven for sanctions busting.\n\n\u201cRelations with the US are OK, there\u2019s a commitment to keep advancing the relationship,\u201d said the person briefed on the matter.\n\n*This story has been updated to correct the year", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/62238b19-7afb-47eb-a752-e9cffae5809f"}},

the UAE will be too beholden to the oil and gas industry", "date": "2023-05-2600:00:00.0", "body": "When Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic senator for Rhode Island, was invited to a dinner at the culmination of the COP27 climate talks in Egypt last year, he was expecting to meet some American businessmen in the region.\n\nInstead, to his dismay, the dinner was co-hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce, a powerful lobbying group with ties to the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\u201cThe fact that this manoeuvre was pulled at the COP in Sharm el-Sheikh left a pretty sour taste in my mouth,\u201d says Whitehouse, who for nine years gave a weekly speech in the US Senate warning about the impending climate disaster.\n\nSo when the host nation for this year\u2019s summit, the United Arab Emirates, appointed oil executive Sultan al-Jaber to the pivotal role of COP28 president, Whitehouse decided he had had enough.\n\nAlong with European colleagues, he orchestrated a letter to US president Joe Biden and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, calling on them to press the UAE into replacing Jaber, who is also the head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. His leadership, argued more than 100 signatories last week, risked \u201cundermining the negotiations.\u201d\n\nThe letter is the most dramatic example yet of a growing blowback against the COP28 presidency from climate experts, lawmakers and humanitarian groups, who fear that the organising team\u2019s ties to the fossil fuel industry will impede progress at this year\u2019s summit in November.\n\nThe appointment was \u201ca scandal\u201d and a \u201cperfect example of a conflict of interest,\u201d says Michael Bloss, a German member of the European parliament with the Green Party, who signed the letter. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting the tobacco industry in charge of ending smoking.\u201d\n\nScientists are clear that reducing the production and use of coal, oil and gas is key to meeting the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.\n\nBut Jaber has instead talked about the need to tackle fossil fuel \u201cemissions,\u201d a distinction that analysts says is out of the industry playbook and implied using carbon capture technology, which is unproven at scale, to prolong the use of the polluting fuels.\n\nThe role of COP president is instrumental to the direction and objectives of the annual summit, which brings together world leaders, negotiators, businesses and civil society groups to seek consensus on how to address climate change.\n\nA COP28 that lacks ambition and fails to achieve progress would feed into broader concerns about the effectiveness of the summits, following sustained criticism of COP27 \u2014 which more than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists registered to attend.\n\nThe deal penned in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, did not include a commitment to phasing down fossil fuels despite broad support for the idea from nations including the EU and US, following pushback from oil producing countries including Saudi Arabia.\n\nExperts say it is too early to write off COP28, but that time is running out for the presidency to win the confidence of the international community and show it has real ambitions to make it a success.\n\nCOP presidencies must be neutral, says Alden Meyer, a senior associate at think-tank E3G: \u201cCan the incoming president and his team rise above UAE\u2019s own interests as a fossil fuels producer? That\u2019s the real question.\u201d\n\nThe announcement of Jaber as COP28 president in January sparked immediate anger from civil society groups, who said it was folly to expect the head of a major oil company to advocate for ambitious climate action. Under Jaber, the Adnoc board last year accelerated plans to increase oil production capacity.\n\nThe Emirates countered that Jaber had been instrumental in guiding the UAE\u2019s adoption of renewables and launching Abu Dhabi\u2019s clean energy company, Masdar, in 2006. Jaber remains the chair of Masdar, which has invested or committed $30bn to renewable power projects across 40 countries. But while Adnoc, which is a shareholder in Masdar, has committed $150bn in capital spending over five years to 2027, only $15bn is earmarked for \u201clow carbon solutions\u201d until 2030.\n\nThe appointment of Jaber was followed by a series of uncomfortable developments, including the news that the UAE had invited the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad to the conference and hired a political adviser from the UK who was opposed to windfall taxes on oil and gas firms to help with communications.\n\nThe louder the criticism gets, however, the more the COP28 team is likely to dig in and go on the defensive, says one person with knowledge of the group, adding that they had been \u201csurprised\u201d by the level of criticism they had received.\n\nThe COP28 team did not comment on whether it considered Jaber\u2019s dual roles a conflict of interests, but noted his 20 years working in the renewable energy sector, his experience in climate diplomacy and his role in \u201cdecarbonising, transforming and future proofing Adnoc.\u201d\n\nJaber had this year \u201cconsistently called on the oil and gas sector to up its game, do more, and do it faster,\u201d it said, and although \u201cthe phaseout of fossil fuels is inevitable\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009this will take time.\u201d\n\nWestern leaders have stood by Jaber, in public at least. The EU\u2019s commissioner for green policy Frans Timmermans and US climate envoy John Kerry each voiced their support for him soon after his appointment. The French diplomat Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris Agreement, wrote in May:\u00a0\u201cWho better than the UAE to demonstrate it is part of the solution? The UAE cannot afford to play it safe.\u201d\n\nBut it is yet to show evidence of significant ambition. COP presidents typically work to build support for their ideas throughout the year, over months of careful diplomacy.\n\nMay\u2019s Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin was expected to be a moment when the COP28 presidency outlined its vision for the summit.\n\nInstead, Jaber told those present that fossil fuels would \u201ccontinue to play a role in the foreseeable future\u201d, and provided little detail about the team\u2019s plans for the conference.\n\nThat worried some officials, who are looking to the Bonn Climate Change Conference in June \u2014 roughly the halfway point to COP \u2014 as the next major moment when a blueprint might come.\n\nOne developing country negotiator says it is \u201ckey\u201d that the COP28 team set out its vision \u201cbefore the summer break.\u201d\n\nAlex Scott, E3G\u2019s lead for climate diplomacy, puts it more bluntly: \u201cJaber has two weeks to save COP28\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009he needs to arrive in Bonn with a plan of action. It\u2019s vital for his credibility that he meets the challenge and ensures he\u2019s not simply seen as a defender of oil and gas interests.\u201d\n\nCOP28 said the president had \u201cdetailed priorities multiple times\u201d after a \u201clistening and engagement tour\u201d this year, including making climate finance more available and tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\nOne major focus at COP28 will be the so-called \u201cglobal stocktake\u201d, when countries will assess progress towards cutting emissions. Another key discussion will be about how a new fund to help pay for the damage done to developing nations by extreme weather events will function. And all eyes will be watching to see whether the final deal includes a commitment to phase down fossil fuels.\n\nBut Jaber\u2019s focus on fossil fuel emissions, and the team\u2019s early plans for a new alliance of oil and gas companies committed to reducing emissions that was widely branded as unambitious, have worried analysts.\n\nThe developing country negotiator said the focus on fossil fuel emissions was \u201ca dangerous distraction.\u201d\n\nMafalda Duarte, the incoming head of the UN\u2019s Green Climate Fund, says Jaber was right about the need to invest in solutions such as clean energy, but questioned the focus on carbon capture technologies: \u201cThis is where the scepticism comes in.\u201d\n\nThe need to ramp up renewables, which Jaber has stressed, was only \u201cone side of the equation,\u201d says Meyer. \u201cI think they are trying to avoid having a full-blown commitment to the kind of reduction in fossil fuel production and consumption that we need to see\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009That\u2019s going to lead to a real clash in Dubai.\u201d\n\nBeyond the fossil fuels question, the presidency will have to navigate other difficult challenges, including how to make civil society groups feel comfortable in a country that does not allow protests.\n\nThe summit has brought the UAE\u2019s human rights record under renewed scrutiny. Advocacy groups have called for the release of dozens of dissidents who have been detained since 2012 for demanding political reforms.\n\nThere is also the question of how western diplomats might negotiate being in the same place as the Syrian leader and his representatives, if they choose to attend. The invite, which has been widely criticised, was seen as part of a move by countries in the region to improve relations with a regime under sanctions by the UN and others for its use of chemical weapons and other alleged war crimes and acts of brutality.\n\nHow the COP28 team juggles the competing interests at the summit will be the best test of its commitment to tackling climate change, analysts say \u2014 especially as the influence of the regional powerhouse, Saudi Arabia, is expected to weigh heavily on the host.\n\nBut a COP hosted by a petrostate was always going to attract particular scrutiny, experts say. \u201cNo matter who they put up for the president, there was going to be a perception of a conflict,\u201d says Meyer. Jaber was \u201ca lightning rod for a much broader critique of the system.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, the UN\u2019s climate chief Simon Stiell is working to reform the COP process to make it more transparent.\u00a0Civil society groups hope changes will include a new conflict of interests policy and rules that would require COP participants to disclose climate-related lobbying.\n\nBut such ideas have been around for years, with little progress made, reportedly as a result of resistance from countries including the US and Australia.\n\nDespite discomfort at the UAE\u2019s hosting in some quarters, no countries are yet talking publicly about boycotting the summit. Representatives of climate vulnerable countries said it was important for them to be present.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to being there,\u201d says ambassador Samuelu Laloniu, a special envoy from Tuvalu, a low-lying Pacific island at risk from sea level rise. \u201cOur absence from the discussion will not serve the interests of our islands.\u201d\n\nAmbassador Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Pa\u2019olelei Luteru, the Samoan chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, says countries must attend the summit to have \u201ca mature, productive conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an issue that requires all of us to work together,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s perhaps more important to engage with those that do not necessarily share your perspective.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean ignoring the key issues at hand, adds Laloniu. \u201cThe only way to keep the [1.5C] target alive is to address the problem at the source,\u201d and fossil fuels are \u201cthe culprit here.\u201d\n\nIf western leaders do nothing else, says the Democratic senator Whitehouse, they must maintain close scrutiny of the UAE until November.\n\n\u201cThe prudent step,\u201d he says, is to pile on the pressure \u201cto try to create the transparency and the environment where they can\u2019t go easy on the fossil fuel industry.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Simeon Kerr", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/37d14048-f798-4c9d-b872-211447351da1"}}, {"id": "da2be785-cbd5-4c55-a89b-7d3a590efbbe", "event_name": "Syrian leader Assad invited to COP 28 climate summit in Dubai ", "blurb": "Move likely to cause disquiet among those expressing disdain for the pace of reconciliation with Damascus", "date": "2023-05-1500:00:00.0", "body": "The United Arab Emirates has invited Bashar al-Assad to attend the COP 28 climate summit in Dubai, the latest move by countries in the region to rehabilitate the Syrian president but one that is likely to cause discomfort for western leaders and climate advocates.\n\nSyria, which was readmitted to the Arab League this month, received the invite from a UAE representative at its embassy in Damascus on Monday, according to the Syrian state news agency.\n\nThe invitation to the gathering later this year will cause disquiet in those countries that have expressed disdain for the pace of reconciliation with the Syrian leader, whose regime was accused of war crimes during the country\u2019s devastating civil war.\n\nIt would be his first global summit since before the outbreak of the war in 2011, and it holds the potential for awkward encounters with western leaders who have sanctioned his regime and called for him to be removed.\n\nThe holding of the UN climate summit in the UAE has been contentious from the outset, after the appointment of the head of the state-owned oil company, Sultan Al Jaber, as president of COP28, and the inclusion of fossil fuel industry leaders as formal participants.\n\n\u201cCOP28 is committed to an inclusive COP process that produces transformational solutions,\u201d said a COP 28 spokesperson. \u201cThis can only happen if we have everyone in the room.\u201d The meeting would be a \u201cmilestone opportunity\u201d to drive progress towards keeping the goals and ambitions of the Paris climate deal alive, the spokesperson added.\n\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia have been leading Arab efforts to rehabilitate the Syrian regime, which has been able to reassert its control over most of Syria after receiving military backing from Iran and Russia during the civil war.\n\nAlthough Syria\u2019s readmittance to the Arab League is a largely symbolic move, analysts see it as a boost to Assad, whom they believe is seeking rehabilitation on the global stage without having to make significant concessions.\n\nDiplomats said some states \u2014 including Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan and Egypt \u2014 had previously opposed Syria rejoining the league. Those in opposition believe Assad has done little to rehabilitate himself since the civil war that began when he brutally crushed anti-government protests during the Arab spring uprisings of 2011.\n\nRegional diplomats said more concrete steps were required before most Arab states could support normalising relations with Syria.\n\nThose opposed to Syria\u2019s readmission to the Arab League had wanted the re-engagement to be carried out through a step-by-step process, hoping they could secure commitments from Assad on humanitarian issues, refugees and curbing the illegal trade in narcotics that have become an economic lifeline for Damascus.\n\nWhile Turkey and some Gulf countries sought the overthrow of Assad during the initial stages of the civil war, he was able to regain control of most of the country by 2016 with the support of Moscow and Tehran.\n\nThe rise of Islamist extremist\u00a0groups in the fight against the regime also raised concerns among some Gulf monarchies, including the UAE, which are opposed to the regional threat posed by political Islam.\n\nThe remnants of the opposition still control north-western pockets of the devastated nation, while US-backed Kurdish militias control the north-east.\n\nThe regime remains under western sanctions and millions of Syrians have been internally displaced or sought refuge in foreign countries.

It\u2019s the same feeling I had in New York all those\u00a0years ago when I was building my first perfume brand. A lot of creatives are moving here at the moment. I\u2019ve been spending time in the arts district \u2013 there are all these young entrepreneurial companies starting up, and it reminds me of how east London was 20 years ago. Everyone is bouncing ideas off each other \u2013 collaborations are becoming almost a currency here now.\n\nWe already sell my perfume line, Jo Loves, in Dubai, and one of the reasons we came is that it\u2019s a great hub from which to expand to other markets like China, Singapore, Japan and India, as well as the Gulf states. Despite having sold my first perfume company to Est\u00e9e Lauder more than 30 years ago, and creating\u00a0Jo Loves in 2009, I\u2019ve always felt there\u2019s another huge \u201csomething\u201d I\u2019m meant to do. I still don\u2019t know what it is, but I feel it\u2019s going to happen here.\n\nI think it\u2019s partly because I\u2019m very driven by my senses, and Dubai is a very\u00a0sensorial city. I would love to build a hotel for the senses. Or create a\u00a0tapas bar for your sense of smell and\u00a0taste. You can imagine both of those existing here. There\u2019s no more glorious example of sensory overload than the Spice Souk in the Old Town, which you arrive at in a little boat. As well as being a great way to immerse yourself in the city, for\u00a0me it\u2019s a huge learning experience because I smell things\u00a0that I\u2019ve never, ever come across before. New scents\u00a0just sort of stop me in my tracks, and I\u2019ll have to go\u00a0and talk to the seller, find out what it is, how it\u2019s made and how it\u2019s used. There are also lots of lovely silk and fabric shops around there. I\u2019ll buy scarves and occasionally have a dress made if I see a fabric\u00a0I\u00a0can\u2019t resist. I also love this little place called Al Seef, which they describe as a \u201cheritage village\u201d. It\u2019s been built right on the creek. I\u2019m very drawn to colour, and here everything is terracotta with beautiful turquoise wooden doors. I like to go there and sit and have a coffee. You just feel like you\u2019re part of something.\n\nIf you want to experience something of \u201cnew Dubai\u201d, City Walk has just been built. It\u2019s kind of an outside-inside shopping district, very shiny and\u00a0new but done in quite an elegant way. It\u2019s more than 10mn sq ft, so gives you a sense of the scale of the city, and\u00a0also its ambition. That\u2019s why I\u00a0love the Museum of the\u00a0Future: it\u2019s not about telling you\u00a0stories from the past. My favourite part is this huge laboratory that\u2019s like something out of a Spielberg movie. I\u00a0could spend days there.\n\nWhen we first got here, we lived at the\u00a0One&Only Royal Mirage, which I think has the best spa hammam in Dubai. It\u2019s just total luxury, from the heated marble slab to the traditional black soap cleansing ritual, the Ghassoul clay wrap, the drizzling of the oil and the full body massage. I can\u2019t even describe how clean you feel afterwards.\n\nThe only thing that could possibly bring you back down to earth after that could be the Dubai traffic \u2013 it can be as bad\u00a0as everyone says. You could easily get stuck on the motorway for an hour just travelling between meetings.\n\nTraffic notwithstanding, the best time to visit is probably from September through\u00a0to April. Spring is when you get the wildflowers in the desert; I can smell them on the air in the mornings. There is also a lovely literary festival in February. One night, we all\u00a0went\u00a0into the desert to listen to poetry under the stars,\u00a0sitting on carpets in front of log fires.\u00a0There\u2019s something beautiful around every corner.

would take an \u201cinclusive\u201d approach to tackling climate change.\n\nLise Masson, climate justice and energy advocacy officer at Friends of the Earth International, said the COP conferences had

to phase down all fossil fuels.\n\nA COP28 UAE spokesperson said the conference would \u201ctake an inclusive approach that engages all stakeholders from the public and private sectors, civil society, scientific community, women and youth\u201d and \u201cwelcome inclusive, constructive dialogues that facilitate consensus-building to drive ambitious climate outcomes\u201d.\n\nThey said organisers

operator, Mobile TeleSystems, had sanctions imposed by the US and UK last month as part the waves of sanctions that the west has imposed on Russian individuals and entities since President Vladimir Putin launched his full invasion of Ukraine a year ago.\n\nThe Russian lender was the first foreign bank in several years to receive a licence in the Gulf state.\n\nUAE officials have rejected western concerns about the country being used for sanctions evasion, saying the authorities had worked to halt financial flows from sanctioned Russian entities, while refusing to discriminate against non-sanctioned companies and individuals.\n\nThe UAE, which is an Opec member, has maintained cordial relations with Moscow since the Russian invasion. Tens of thousands of Russians have settled in the UAE, mainly in Dubai, over the past year in a bid to escape financial restrictions in Europe or to avoid the military draft back home. Many have complained of difficulty in opening bank accounts, especially corporate facilities, at banks already operating in the Gulf state.\n\nUS treasury officials had previously raised concerns about the granting of a banking licence to MTS.\n\nUS president Joe Biden\u2019s administration is also worried that the UAE is becoming a hub for the shipment of items such as electronics that can be repurposed to help Russia\u2019s war effort. US, UK and EU officials visited the Gulf nation last month to raise concerns with Emirati officials.\n\nThe pressure on the UAE over its links to Russians comes as the Gulf state seeks to demonstrate it has tightened financial compliance and boosted criminal enforcement following the global anti-money laundering watchdog\u2019s decision a year ago to place it on its so-called \u201cgrey list\u201d.\n\nUAE officials have said they have taken many steps to address the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force\u2019s concerns.\n\nThe Gulf state is a traditional western ally but in recent years it has sought to boost relations with other world powers, including Russia and China, as it has become frustrated with the US\u2019s perceived disengagement from the Middle East.\n\nDubai is the region\u2019s premier trade, finance and tourism hub and has long been the destination of choice for international banks and multinationals operating in the Middle East.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/29f6200c-f7f7-420e-b57f-081f03595877"}}, {"id": "3aefb1a7-6781-43dc-aebf-05ac991c17f5", "event_name": "Abu Dhabi ruler projects stability by naming eldest son as crown prince", "blurb": "Sheikh Mohammed ends succession speculation after choosing Sheikh Khaled amid string of changes to the leadership", "date": "2023-03-3000:00:00.0", "body": "Sheikh Khaled bin Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan had a hectic agenda in the weeks before he was named Abu Dhabi\u2019s new crown prince.\n\nAmong other duties, he hosted Microsoft\u2019s president and the chief executive of IBM, inaugurated a new port district, attended a government leadership retreat and visited the joint operations command of the United Arab Emirates\u2019 defence ministry.\n\nAll were evidence of the increasingly prominent role that Sheikh Khaled has taken in recent years, one that fuelled chatter that his father, UAE president and Abu Dhabi ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, was grooming his eldest son to be heir apparent.\n\nBut such is the intrigue around opaque Gulf palace politics that until his appointment was announced on Wednesday, speculation was rife about whether Sheikh Khaled, 43, would become crown prince or whether Sheikh Mohammed, known as MBZ, would opt for one of his more experienced brothers, particularly Sheikh Tahnoon, the UAE\u2019s powerful national security adviser.\n\nMBZ, who last year succeeded his late brother, Sheikh Khalifa, will hope the appointment ends talk of potential power struggles within his ruling family and projects stability and continuity in the oil-rich capital and leader of the seven-emirate federation, analysts say.\n\n\u201c[The UAE] is a rising power in the Middle East and if there was any question as to who is taking responsibility for maybe the next 50 years this clears it up,\u201d Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati professor of politics, said. \u201cEven before his father was president, everybody knew Sheikh Khaled was being given more and more responsibility.\u201d\n\nSheikh Khaled\u2019s rise through the ranks has stretched across key sectors of the economy, security and energy. A graduate of Georgetown university, he is a deputy national security adviser and chair of the executive committee of state oil company Adnoc. He is also a member of the powerful Supreme Council for Financial and Economic Affairs, and was this month appointed to the board of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia), the $790bn sovereign wealth fund.\n\nHe now replaces his father as chair of Abu Dhabi\u2019s executive council, in effect the emirate\u2019s cabinet, of which he has also been a member for several years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s seen as a serious and sharp individual,\u201d said Taufiq Rahim, a senior fellow at the New America think-tank. \u201cThe question will be how soon he will assert more influence in Abu Dhabi\u2019s key institutions.\u201d\n\nMBZ was during his 18 years as crown prince often seen as the chief executive driving Abu Dhabi\u2019s development, to Sheikh Khalifa\u2019s chairman.\n\nAfter Sheikh Khalifa suffered a stroke in 2014, MBZ became de facto leader, overseeing a more assertive foreign policy that led to interventions in conflicts in Yemen and Libya, as well as a crackdown on dissent and the use of Abu Dhabi\u2019s oil riches to raise its profile overseas.\n\nThe 62-year-old leader is expected to rule for years to come. But the appointment of the crown prince, as well as other changes to top posts, reflected a devolving of some power as he focused on the presidency, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cOne thing you can draw from some of the recent announcements \u2014 this is essentially the end of one transition and the beginning of another,\u201d said a person close to Abu Dhabi\u2019s leadership.\n\nKey among those who have been elevated are some of MBZ\u2019s full brothers, known collectively as the \u201cBani Fatima six\u201d, in reference to their mother.\n\nFor the first time, Abu Dhabi has two deputy rulers after MBZ on Wednesday named Sheikh Tahnoon and Sheikh Hazza, another full brother, to the newly created positions. Some believe they will be ceremonial posts, others say it is a sign of MBZ spreading leadership duties.\n\nIn a surprise move, MBZ also appointed another full brother, Sheikh Mansour, who has served as the UAE\u2019s deputy prime minister and owns Manchester City football club, as a vice-president of the Gulf state.\n\nThat means he will work alongside his father-in-law, Dubai\u2019s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who is also a vice-president and prime minister of the UAE.\n\nAnalysts say the creation of a second vice-president suggests a further consolidation of Abu Dhabi\u2019s dominance in the federation. But it could also ease some of the federal burdens on Dubai\u2019s septuagenarian leader.\n\nOther high profile changes this month have included Sheikh Tahnoon taking over as chair of Adia, which further expanded his muscular portfolio. He already chairs ADQ, another state investment fund, First Abu Dhabi Bank, the nation\u2019s largest lender, and International Holding Company, a conglomerate that has risen from obscurity to boast a market capitalisation of about $236bn.\n\nSheikh Mansour has also replaced MBZ as chair of Mubadala, another of Abu Dhabi\u2019s investment vehicles, which manages assets of about $284bn.\n\nSome view the string of changes as part of a balancing act MBZ has had to play within the ruling family.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s balancing between empowering his son as crown prince, but also giving additional responsibilities to his brothers who may have seen themselves as part of the succession plan,\u201d said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nOthers believe MBZ is spreading responsibility among trusted lieutenants as the UAE\u2019s ambitions grow. David Roberts, a Gulf expert at King\u2019s College London, called the raft of changes a \u201cnice housekeeping exercise\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe long term history of [succession in Gulf monarchies] has been incredibly tricky, so there always needs to be a process of clarity about who goes where,\u201d Roberts said.\n\n\u201cThe UAE is evolving in so many ways, economically and politically, that evolving its governance structure seems quite logical for a state that has grown exponentially in recent years.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/582989c9-57b5-4b4b-9d8a-db47a5934d5b"}}, {"id": "928f9281-c07a-4e0a-937f-25036caf4876", "event_name": "Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed names his son crown prince of Abu Dhabi ", "blurb": "UAE leader appoints Sheikh Khaled as heir apparent as part of series of changes at top of Gulf state", "date": "2023-03-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates, has named his eldest son crown prince of Abu Dhabi as part of a series of changes to the oil-rich Gulf state\u2019s top leadership.\n\nThe appointment of Sheikh Khaled as heir apparent was widely expected as he has taken on more prominent roles in recent years and it will end speculation about the succession, particularly the potential for a power struggle.\n\nSheikh Mohammed also promoted three of his full brothers, naming Sheikh Tahnoon, who is the UAE\u2019s national security adviser and also oversees a sprawling business empire, and Sheikh Hazza, who is deputy chair of Abu Dhabi\u2019s powerful executive council, as deputy rulers of the emirate.\n\nSheikh Mansour, the UAE\u2019s deputy prime minister and best known outside the Gulf for owning English football club Manchester City, was appointed vice-president of the state. That will mean he will serve alongside Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, the prime minister and the ruler of Dubai.\n\nThe changes come almost a year after Sheikh Mohammed, known as MBZ, became president of the UAE, a federation of seven emirates, and the ruler of Abu Dhabi after the death of his half brother, Sheikh Khalifa.\n\nMBZ had already been the Gulf state\u2019s de facto leader for almost a decade as Sheikh Khalifa\u2019s health declined, and he is regarded as one of the Arab world\u2019s most influential leaders. The UAE has pursued an assertive foreign policy under his watch.\n\nSanam Vakil, director of the Middle East programme at think-tank Chatham House, said MBZ had \u201cformalised multiple appointments to show confidence and capacity\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe moves also institutionalise a succession process which is important to build confidence about the UAE\u2019s continuity and governance model,\u201d she said.\n\nThe appointments cement the influence of MBZ and his five full brothers, known as the \u201cBani Fatima six\u201d, in reference to their mother.\n\nSheikh Khaled, the crown prince, is in his early 40s and was educated in the US before starting his formal government career within the security services. He has taken on increasingly senior posts in recent years and is a member of Abu Dhabi\u2019s executive council, the capital\u2019s top decision-making body, and chair of the Abu Dhabi executive office.\n\nHis public profile has also been raised as he has inaugurated projects, hosted chief executives of multinational companies and met foreign dignitaries.\n\nSigns of changes to senior positions came earlier this month when Sheikh Tahnoon was named chair of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia) the emirate\u2019s $790bn sovereign wealth fund, replacing the late Sheikh Khalifa.\n\nHe was already one of the UAE\u2019s most influential figures and chairs ADQ, a state investment company, First Abu Dhabi Bank, the country\u2019s largest lender, and International Holding Company, a listed conglomerate that has a market capitalisation of about $236bn.\n\nMeanwhile, Sheikh Mansour replaced MBZ this month as chair of Mubadala, one of Abu Dhabi\u2019s most active state investment funds, which manages assets of about $284bn.\n\nGulf experts said those moves were a sign of MBZ stepping back from some of his roles as he settles into the presidency and elevates his most trusted lieutenants.\n\nAbu Dhabi is by far the most powerful of the seven emirates that make up the federation, each with its own ruling family, and it steers the UAE\u2019s foreign and defence policies.\n\nMBZ\u2019s appointments come at a time when Abu Dhabi is enjoying a petrodollar windfall from last year\u2019s oil boom and is becoming an increasingly active global investor through its stable of sovereign wealth funds.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/85d074ac-a6af-4f83-b454-8bfc3b2bb4f8"}}, {"id": "a1a106f6-70de-4b9b-b60a-bb300d2d6c83", "event_name": "Middle East on \u2018radar\u2019 of global investors as it enjoys IPO boom", "blurb": "Frenzy of activity across the region contrasts sharply with Europe\u2019s moribund market", "date": "2023-03-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Shares in Presight AI, a data analytics company, soared on Monday, their first day of trading on the Abu Dhabi bourse after a $496mn initial public offering that was 136 times oversubscribed.\n\nThe demand is no one-off.

Over the past five years, market capitalisation has surged about 475 per cent. The market regulator said there were now 269 listed companies compared with 188 at the end of 2017, with another 80 preparing to float.\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, the national oil company has floated a series of assets, fostering a similar surge of listings.\n\nFast food operator Americana, owned by the Saudi sovereign Public Investment Fund and Dubai businessman Mohamed Alabbar, listed on both Abu Dhabi and Riyadh exchanges in December amid surging demand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook from Europe \u2014 in the UK it was the mid to late \u201980s with the privatisation drive that encouraged activity,\u201d said a senior US-based capital markets banker. \u201cIt helped stimulate markets and promote more of an equity culture and encourage private enterprise to come public.\u201d\n\nDubai\u2019s successful handling of the pandemic lured crypto billionaires and financial executives who took advantage of its open economy.

Four have already been listed, including utility Dewa and road-toll company Salik.\n\nAzevedo said the region was moving into a \u201csecond phase\u201d of listings, with \u201cnon-government entities IPO-ing in the UAE, both Dubai and Abu Dhabi\u201d. \u201cThis year will see a few family-owned companies coming through,\u201d he added.\n\nFamily-owned businesses make up as much as 90 per cent of the private sectors in countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. As founders die, their heirs often fall into recriminations. Going public is a means of imposing corporate governance and succession-planning arrangements to avoid familial strife.\n\nAl Ansari Financial Services, a family-owned company and the UAE\u2019s largest exchange house chain, on Monday raised $210mn amid strong demand for its IPO on Dubai\u2019s stock market.

The agreement between the rival Middle East powers was part of a China-brokered deal signed by Shamkhani and his Saudi counterpart in Beijing.\n\nShamkhani had extra credibility as a regional dealmaker because Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appointed him secretary of the powerful Supreme National Security Council, according to analysts in the country.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Shamkhani is directly involved in such talks shows the Islamic republic is determined to improve its ties with the Arab states\u201d in the Gulf, said Saeed Laylaz, an Iranian political analyst. He added that Shamkhani\u2019s priorities at the UAE talks should be to end the nine-year Yemen conflict and ease the transfer of foreign currencies into Iran. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have led the military intervention into Yemen.\n\nNournews, affiliated to Iran\u2019s leading security organisation, said the Abu Dhabi trip was in response to a visit by the UAE national security adviser, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, to Iran in late 2021.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon also made a secret visit to Iran in 2019 to help ease tensions between the two neighbours after an attack on oil tankers off the coast of UAE that the US blamed on Iran. The attack raised fears in Abu Dhabi that Tehran could target the UAE, a US ally, in revenge for crippling sanctions imposed by then US president Donald Trump.\n\nDrone strikes on Abu Dhabi last year, claimed by Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen, highlighted its vulnerability to attacks. The Gulf state, which normalised ties with Israel in 2020, has also been keen to distance itself from any potential military action taken by the Jewish state against Iran.\n\nNournews said senior economic, banking and security officials would accompany Shamkhani for talks that would encompass bilateral, regional and international issues. Iran has, according to analysts, over the past decade used businesses in the commercial centres of the UAE to circumvent debilitating sanctions imposed by the US in response to Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.\n\nThe UAE has been among Iran\u2019s top trading partners for decades even during difficult times between the two states. Tehran\u2019s latest official figures showed $13.6bn worth of goods were imported to Iran through the Gulf state, which accounted for almost 31 per cent of all imports during the first 10 months of the Iranian year that ends next week.\n\nRelations between the UAE and Iran deteriorated after Iranian vigilantes attacked the Saudi embassy in Tehran in 2016 to protest against the kingdom\u2019s execution of a senior Shia cleric. The UAE responded by recalling its ambassador in Tehran. Last year it restored full diplomatic relations after a tentative rapprochement.\n\nTehran\u2019s latest diplomatic moves have raised hopes among many Iranians and the country\u2019s business community that the country\u2019s hardline leaders might be preparing for a revival of the 2015 nuclear accord with global powers. But despite the thawing of regional relations there has been no strong signal from the Iranian leadership that it was ready to return to the nuclear deal. Trump exited the accord in 2018.\n\nLaylaz said Iran had \u201cno choice but to eventually make concessions with the US as both have reached a dead end in dealing with each other.\u201d He added that \u201cfor now, Iranians feel relieved that some progress is happening in foreign policy.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/924ed8b0-8bce-4b06-b8d2-1a06746b1778"}}, {"id": "e93999c1-3249-4544-84c4-d5ab08a5b270", "event_name": "Sheikh Tahnoon\u2019s IHC reports another year of stellar growth ", "blurb": "Abu Dhabi conglomerate\u2019s profits almost triple as emirate\u2019s new regime consolidates power", "date": "2023-03-1000:00:00.0", "body": "Abu Dhabi\u2019s International Holding Company grew net profit by 181 per cent in 2022 as the listed vehicle controlled by Abu Dhabi\u2019s Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan reported another year of exceptional growth.\n\nProfit at the rapidly growing conglomerate grew from Dh11.6bn ($3.2bn) in 2021 to Dh32.6bn last year, thanks to what the company described as subsidiaries\u2019 performance and global acquisitions.\n\nIHC\u2019s fortunes in recent years have perplexed bankers owing to its meteoric rise under Sheikh Tahnoon, the national security adviser of the United Arab Emirates, who became chair of the conglomerate in 2020.\n\nIHC\u2019s results come as Sheikh Tahnoon, who also chairs Abu Dhabi\u2019s state holding company ADQ and the country\u2019s largest lender First Abu Dhabi Bank, was this week elevated as chair of the $790bn Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.\n\nPromotion to head the emirate\u2019s investment vehicle signalled a further consolidation of power around the UAE\u2019s new ruler and Sheikh Tahnoon\u2019s full brother, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan.

By comparison, this pattern was observed for only 8 per cent of trades in Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and 3 per cent of Etisalat, two other big ADX-listed stocks.\n\nOwnership in IHC and Alpha Dhabi is highly concentrated and the proportion of shares readily available to trade is limited. IHC, which is 62 per cent owned by Royal Group, an entity controlled by Sheikh Tahnoon, has a free float of about 24 per cent, the company told the FT late last year.

Alpha Dhabi\u2019s report from the same year said 19 shareholders controlled more than 98 per cent of its stock.\n\nForeign investors \u2014 who have recently tended to be either US citizens or Emirati expatriates \u2014 make up a tiny share: 6 per cent in IHC and 3 per cent in Alpha Dhabi, according to ADX data.\n\nThere is no suggestion of illegal activity by IHC, which pledged $400mn to Indian billionaire Gautam Adani\u2019s abortive share sale last week, or its subsidiaries but their expansion and activities have left bankers and analysts scratching their heads.\n\n\u201cIf you want to get exposure to them you can\u2019t because you can\u2019t access their shares \u2014 it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said the market analyst. \u201cIt raises the question: why is all this happening? In a way, it\u2019s no one\u2019s business, but it does cast a shadow on the market. It changes the character in some ways but in others it doesn\u2019t at all, because this activity is for friends and families, it seems. It\u2019s not for the world at large to participate.\u201d\n\nIHC said its shares \u201care available to the market at a price for anyone\u201d who wishes to invest, adding that it was \u201copen, true and direct with information about our organisation, while adhering to market regulators\u2019 governance and compliance standards\u201d.\n\nADX said it \u201coperates to the highest principles of corporate governance and transparency\u201d, adding that listed companies \u201cmust adhere to comprehensive disclosure guidelines that are in line with global standards\u201d.\n\nThe state\u2019s influence is never far away. Among the 13 companies that have listed on the ADX since 2020 is Abu Dhabi Ports, which is majority owned by ADQ, a sovereign investment vehicle that also controls ADX and is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon.\n\nOther recent IPOs of business that foreign investors do understand,\u00a0include Borouge,\u00a0 a joint venture between state oil company Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and Borealis,\u00a0and satellite communications company Yahsat, which is controlled by Mubadala, another state investment fund\n\nBut IHC and its subsidiaries have produced the most spectacular growth, through big transfers of assets from related companies, with IHC\u2019s assets swelling from $215mn in 2018 to $54bn as of September 2022.\n\nAlpha Dhabi\u2019s assets jumped from $1.5bn in 2020 to nearly $13bn in 2021, the year of its listing, as it reported a surge in profits from $59mn to $1.4bn and a fourfold rise in revenue to $5bn. Its number of subsidiaries went from 16 to more than 100.\n\nIHC says asset transfers from Royal Group, many for a nominal charge of one dirham, have been a key driver of its growth.\n\nAlpha Dhabi \u2014 formerly known as Trojan \u2014 was previously wholly owned by Royal Group. In April 2021 a 45 per cent stake was transferred for \u201cnil consideration\u201d to IHC, which today owns 86 per cent of the company. More than 40 companies have been transferred from Royal Group, the majority at a nominal value of one dirham each.\n\nMultiply, a communications company previously wholly owned by Royal Group, was also transferred to IHC for nil consideration on April 1 2020.\n\nIt now holds a driving school, wellness firms, beauty salons and a 7.3 per cent stake in Taqa, a utility company controlled by ADQ and the second largest stock on the ADX.\n\nAssets rose from $26.6mn in 2020 to more than $3bn the following year, it said. Multiply acquired at least three companies in 2021 for nil consideration: Pal Cooling, Emirates Driving School and cosmetics group Bedashing.\n\nMultiply, which listed in December 2021 and boasts a $13bn market capitalisation, is among the 10 largest stocks in the MSCI UAE index.\n\nAlong the way International Securities, an Abu Dhabi brokerage firm acquired by IHC in November 2019, also experienced spectacular growth \u2014 soaring to the top ranks of brokers serving the ADX.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020 it handled 8 per cent of the value of trades and 9.8 per cent of the volumes. It now handles 64.2 per cent by value and 45.3 per cent by volume, according to ADX data. Analysts say the data suggests it buys and sells shares on the ADX in large batches \u2014 a pattern that fits with the trades in IHC shares.\n\nThe broker\u2019s assets grew from $186mn in 2019 to $1.2bn in 2021, while revenues soared 216 per cent, according to IHC\u2019s 2021 annual report.\n\nIHC said International Securities \u201chad fast, yet organic growth considering the number of IPOs [16] they have facilitated since 2020\u201d, adding that the brokerage had attracted 25,000 \u201cactive clients\u201d.\n\nSteffen Hertog, a Gulf expert at the London School of Economics, said the web of companies was a reflection of \u201cthe continued deeper presence of the Al Nahyan family in the Abu Dhabi economy\u201d compared to the ruling Al Maktoum family in Dubai.\n\n\u201cWhich is not to say that the distinction between government and family business is crystal clear in the latter,\u201d he added. \u201cBut there are fewer ruling family players and there is relatively more space for large non-royal private groups.\u201d\n\nData visualisation by Chris Campbell and Patrick Mathurin", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5c8c3dc3-d08a-498a-9ca9-c294db9a3180"}}, {"id": "3542281b-03d0-430f-b6a5-fb9691312f38", "event_name": "How First Abu Dhabi Bank pursued Standard Chartered and \u2018opened Pandora\u2019s box\u2019", "blurb": "UAE\u2019s biggest lender could yet revive the deal and its interest might flush out other suitors", "date": "2023-02-0100:00:00.0", "body": "In November, the world\u2019s tallest tower, Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa, was lit up with the colours and logo of Standard Chartered.\n\nAs the bank\u2019s chief executive Bill Winters and chair Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als looked on, messages such as \u201ctogether we\u2019re here for good\u201d and \u201caligned ambitions\u201d sparked into life.\n\nWhile in Dubai, the two directors held a full board meeting and met senior figures in the region. But two months later they were blindsided when news broke that First Abu Dhabi Bank, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 biggest lender, wanted to buy StanChart.\n\n\u201cIt was a complete surprise to the board,\u201d said one person familiar with the matter.\n\nHowever, it was no secret that the oil-rich Emirates was in an acquisitive mood.\n\nFirst Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) was born in 2017 when the UAE merged its first- and third-largest lenders to create a national champion. But the scale of its international ambitions was only revealed alongside news it had been working for almost a year to buy StanChart and create a lender with more than $1tn in assets operating in more than 60 markets \u2014 a first for the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe region is saying \u2018here we are\u2019. The centre of the world has moved,\u201d said one senior figure who advises FAB. \u201cThey see themselves as a major centre of activity and not just oil economies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe banking sector is absolutely ripe for the next step up,\u201d said Gary Dugan, chief investment officer at Dubai-based Dalma Capital and a former executive of FAB\u2019s predecessor, the National Bank of Abu Dhabi.\n\nAfter the news leaked, FAB quickly said it was no longer evaluating an offer, kicking off a six-month period where they are restricted from acting again, unless another bidder emerges.\n\nBut several people close to the lender say the deal could be revived after the cooling off period ends in July. FAB and StanChart declined to comment.\n\n\u201cThe region certainly has the firepower to make a statement in this regard. We deserve to be taken more seriously,\u201d said a government minister from another country in the Gulf.\n\nCompanies and funds in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have more than $3tn in assets and cash under management, boosted by a boom in energy prices amid the war in Ukraine. Saudi Arabia\u2019s $620bn Public Investment Fund has bought companies from electric vehicle start-up Lucid to Newcastle United football club as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman looks to diversify the economy away from oil.\n\nBut cross-border banking takeovers are very rare because of the cost, complexity and risk involved. Previously, Middle Eastern investors have preferred to take stakes in troubled foreign lenders.\n\nQatari funds led an \u00a311.8bn emergency fundraising for Barclays in 2008 and Middle Eastern investors now own a fifth of Credit Suisse.\n\nDemonstrating the scale of capital that can be brought to bear, the Saudi National Bank\u2019s chair dismissed its recent $1.5bn investment in Credit Suisse as \u201cjust another cheque\u201d, barely more than 2 per cent of its $68.7bn investment portfolio.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 166-year-old brand, so how far below 30 cents on the dollar is it going to go?\u201d he added.\n\nStanChart, 169 years old, trades barely higher at 42 pence on the pound.\n\nFAB is also deep-pocketed and intrinsically linked to the state. Its chair is the UAE\u2019s national security adviser and businessman Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, whose brother is the president and ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan.\n\nAbu Dhabi\u2019s $284bn sovereign investment fund Mubadala owns 38 per cent of FAB and was a driving force behind the attempt for StanChart, according to people familiar with the process. Mubadala said it would not comment on marketplace rumours about publicly listed institutions.\n\nFAB\u2019s stock has surged 72 per cent since the pandemic struck in March 2020, giving it a market value of $43bn, almost double that of StanChart at $25bn.\n\nWhile dominant domestically, FAB\u2019s international network is modest. More than three-quarters of its revenue is made in the UAE and to grow it must diversify.\n\nIn 2021, FAB bought the Egyptian operations of Lebanese bank Audi. Then last February, it grew bolder, making an offer for Egypt-based regional broker and adviser EFG-Hermes to bolster its weak investment banking arm.\n\nAdvisers say the bid was withdrawn a couple of months later amid Egyptian resistance. But disappointment was brushed aside as FAB turned its attention towards StanChart, several people involved in the process told the Financial Times.\n\nEarly last year chief executive Hana Al Rostamani hired New York boutique investment bank Moelis & Co to help identify and analyse transformational targets, said the people. StanChart was top of the list.\n\nIts founder Ken Moelis \u2014 once dubbed \u201cKen of Arabia\u201d for his connections in the region \u2014 helped pitch and explain the rationale to the government officials and technocrats who would have to sanction any offer.\n\nStanChart offered an immediate expansion outside its saturated home market into Africa, India, south-east Asia and China, as well as exposure to Europe and the US. With FAB trading at two times book value to StanChart\u2019s 0.4 times, it was also seen as affordable, the people added.\n\nPerformance at StanChart has lagged behind peers. Winters, who took over in 2015, had overseen an operating income decline while competitors in key markets, such as DBS in Singapore, had grown. Despite announcing several cost-cutting programmes, expenses remain roughly the same as in 2015.\n\nVarious other targets were discussed, such as Barclays and BNP Paribas, the people added. Acquiring a series of smaller lenders was considered, but that was discarded because it would have been \u201ca long arduous process with no certainty of success and huge integration challenges\u201d, another person involved said.\n\nIn the early summer, the board gave the green light to an all-cash bid of \u00a330bn to \u00a332bn aimed at minimising opposition from StanChart.\n\nFAB\u2019s deal team was pushing but some government entities demanded further due diligence on the transaction in the early autumn, one adviser said. FAB would have had to rely on financing from funds such as state-owned ADQ, which is also chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon, and crucially Mubadala, the adviser added. ADQ and Mubadala declined to comment.\n\nBacking could also come from $240bn Abu Dhabi-listed conglomerate International Holding Company \u2014 another business that Tahnoon chairs, one of the people said. IHC said it would not \u201ccomment on market rumours or speculation\u201d.\n\nCitigroup, Bain, Deloitte and Linklaters were brought in to enhance operational capacity and conduct studies around synergies, audit and legal issues.\n\nNeither FAB nor its advisers approached any shareholders or the board, or StanChart\u2019s corporate brokers JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn the end, it did not matter. Due diligence on the deal had not been completed before the news leaked \u2014 something the phalanx of advisers had made inevitable. \u201cToo many cooks spoiled the unready broth,\u201d one of the advisers added.\n\nFAB is considering several options when the cooling off period ends, two of the people involved told the FT.\n\nIt could choose to approach existing large StanChart shareholders and ask them to retain substantial stakes in the expanded group, making the $30bn to $40bn cost easier to digest.\n\nOne top-10 shareholder told the FT that a cash offer of a third above the trading price would mean \u201can argument\u201d internally about whether to take it.\n\n\u201cWe think the bank is trading at a massive discount,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt would be tempting to take it, but we would feel we would be giving away a lot of value.\u201d\n\nBy far the most important shareholder would be Singapore\u2019s state-owned investment fund Temasek, which owns 16.4 per cent of the stock. A cash offer would allow the fund to exit after having built its stake at a higher valuation, but any deal would also face political ramifications given the expected exodus of thousands of StanChart roles from Singapore to the UAE\u2019s capital.\n\nTemasek said it did not comment on market speculation but people briefed on the fund\u2019s thinking said it could consider selling part or all of its stake if another, higher, bid came in. They added that it would be a purely commercial decision.\n\nFAB could also try for a friendly transaction; however, there is a risk that this would lead to a bidding war because the board would be duty-bound to seek rival offers.\n\nThe main hurdle to any transaction remains the need to gain approval from scores of regulators. The trickiest might be the US, which would have to allow the fifth-largest dollar-clearing bank to be regulated by the central bank of the UAE, itself under enhanced scrutiny by the world\u2019s anti-money laundering watchdog.\n\nAnother question is whether FAB\u2019s executive team would be deemed experienced enough to lead a global systemically important financial institution, leading to the prospect of the existing StanChart management being asked to remain in place, said a senior figure at StanChart.\n\nWinters and Vi\u00f1als both said at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos that they had not spoken to FAB since the news broke.\n\n\u201cThis is not something we\u2019ve either engaged with, or been interested in,\u201d Winters said.\n\nThe top 10 shareholder suggested Winters still wanted to turn the bank round himself, something that has become easier to accomplish as rates rise and China\u2019s zero-Covid policy ends.\n\n\u201cWinters doesn\u2019t want his reputation to be tarnished,\u201d the person said.\n\nAfraid of being taken unawares again, StanChart executives are scouring the UAE for intelligence on Abu Dhabi\u2019s intentions. But they also realise that FAB\u2019s approach could flush out other suitors.\n\n\u201cNow the interest is public, it has opened Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d said a senior Middle Eastern banker at a rival. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t FAB, it will be someone else.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Mercedes Ruehl", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7f1f10e8-19ba-4261-b056-a575154c8a98"}}, {"id": "7322fc82-2951-4f54-83e8-c35d6e508ee6", "event_name": "Abu Dhabi\u2019s Adnoc and Gunvor extend talks to reach investment deal", "blurb": "National oil group is seeking a minority stake in commodity trader as it looks to diversify its revenue stream", "date": "2023-01-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and Gunvor, the energy trading house, are extending an exclusivity period for deal talks as they try to reach an agreement over a possible investment.\n\nPeople close to the deal say discussions could lead to Adnoc taking a minority stake in Gunvor, whose net profits soared to\u00a0$841mn in the first half of last year \u2014 higher than its full-year profits in 2021 \u2014 as energy markets were roiled by Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe exclusivity period for the talks, which began last summer, had been due to expire at the end of December, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAdnoc, which is the United Arab Emirates\u2019 state oil producer and pumps roughly 4 per cent of all global crude supplies, is working to diversify its revenue streams and build out its trading division.\n\nGunvor \u2014 co-founded in 2000 by chief executive Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00f6rnqvist and Russian oligarch Gennady Timchenko \u2014 is looking to raise funds to drive growth.\n\nAdnoc\u2019s trading arm is preparing to open its first Swiss office this year, as part of plans to expand the unit.\n\nChief executive Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, who will also serve as president of this year\u2019s UN climate summit when the UAE hosts the meeting in November and December, previously said he wanted\u00a0to \u201cstretch the value\u201d of every barrel of Adnoc oil through investments in refining and trading capacity.\n\nBut the talks have faltered at times, with the two companies having contrasting backgrounds: Adnoc is a state-owned energy behemoth that founded its trading division less than five years ago, while Gunvor is known for its aggressive culture and its once-close ties to Russia.\n\nGunvor is one of a handful of large-scale independent commodity traders, including Trafigura, Vitol and Mercuria, that play a significant role in global energy trading, acting as middlemen and operators of infrastructure such as terminals and refineries.\n\nThe past year has seen unprecedented profits for trading houses because of the volatility in oil and gas markets triggered by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nT\u00f6rnqvist, who controls almost 90 per cent of Gunvor, has been considering a sale for some time. He held unsuccessful talks in 2019 with Algeria\u2019s state-backed energy company Sonatrach and has discussed potential tie-ups with other trading houses in the past, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nWhile Gunvor\u2019s roots lie in Russian oil dealing, it has branched out in recent years to become one of the world\u2019s largest traders of liquefied natural gas.\n\nIn 2014, shortly before Gunvor co-founder Timchenko was sanctioned by the US government for his alleged ties to President Vladimir Putin, the Russian trader sold his stake to T\u00f6rnqvist, and has since left the company. The US state department alleged at the time that Putin himself may \u201chave access to Gunvor funds\u201d without providing evidence.\n\nGunvor has always fiercely denied allegations that it has links to Putin and has spent the nine years since Timchenko\u2019s exit diversifying its business away from the Russian sector, such as selling most of its stake in the Ust Luga oil terminal, close to the border with Estonia.\n\nThe commodity trader, despite its record half-year profits in 2022, has also faced financial pressures due to the high margin calls placed on trading houses owing to the extreme volatility in energy markets last year.\n\nAdnoc and Gunvor declined to comment.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1ad93e45-df18-4419-9080-d41961c817c7"}}, {"id": "cf01984b-4693-4dff-a429-e9d7aa0a2163", "event_name": "UK on course for \u00a310bn of UAE investment after relationship reset", "blurb": "Minister admits last year\u2019s political chaos potentially slowed pace of inward commitments from the Gulf state ", "date": "2023-01-1300:00:00.0", "body": "The UK expects to raise tens of billions of pounds of investment from the United Arab Emirates as it resets its business relationship after last year\u2019s political chaos in Westminster.\n\nGrant Shapps, secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, said on Friday that \u201cpolitical changes\u201d in the UK, which resulted in the country having three prime ministers in a year, had potentially slowed the pace of inward investment from the Gulf state.\n\nHe added that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last February and resulting policy changes, such as windfall taxes on energy companies had also been factors.\n\nDuring meetings with government official and sovereign funds, Shapps said that UAE investors were focused on going beyond the \u00a36.1bn of investment already made through the five-year \u00a310bn UAE-UK partnership, which was sealed in 2021.\n\n\u201cThey [UAE investors] are absolutely certain that they would go to \u00a310bn and beyond,\u201d he said, while the remaining \u00a34bn of inward commitments would be \u201cmet and smashed through\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are tens of billions of pounds more of investment which we know is there,\u201d Shapps said. \u201cThings went on hold a bit over the summer and into the autumn but they [UAE investors] were pleased to hear it\u2019s settled down.\u201d\n\n\u201cRishi Sunak runs a government which is organised, factual and based on data\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009They are very pleased to hear about that,\u201d he added.\n\nUAE investment under the partnership has spanned life sciences, clean energy, technology and infrastructure, including Abu Dhabi sovereign investment firm Mubadala\u2019s \u00a3800mn investment into CityFibre, a UK telecoms company laying broadband lines in the UK.\n\nGulf sovereign funds have privately expressed frustration at the drift in UK decision-making during the end of former prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s administration and Liz Truss\u2019s brief period in office that followed.\n\nThe UAE has been particularly interested in investing in sectors such as clean energy, including battery storage and wind power, as well as nuclear energy and life sciences, said Shapps.

It is a common response to questions about the conglomerate, despite it accounting for a third of the FADX 15, the benchmark index of the ADX Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. As its share price has soared 42,000 per cent since 2019, it has become the second largest listed company in the Middle East after Saudi Aramco, the state oil company.\n\nEven Syed Basar Shueb, who took over as IHC\u2019s chief executive in mid-2019, acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s amazing\u201d.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, he insisted there are simple explanations for the company\u2019s growth \u2014 the transfer of more than 40 companies, which combined are worth $4.7bn according to IHC, from Royal Group, another Abu Dhabi conglomerate. The majority of the businesses were transferred at nominal value of one dirham each, Shueb said.\n\nYet that explains only part of the story: IHC\u2019s total assets have swelled from $215mn at the end of 2018 to $54bn in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nAccording to IHC, this is down to the growth of the businesses it now controls. \u201cWe don\u2019t give any dividend, the profits we made in 2020, 2021 is mainly\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009invested back,\u201d Shueb said. \u201cWe are trying to create a giant here\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009a global giant.\u201d\n\nOthers, however, view IHC as an example of the increasingly blurred relationship between business and power in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital and wealthiest member of the federation. It has also sparked questions about transparency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the biggest threat to the ADX because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u201d said the banker. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great things happening on the ADX, and then there\u2019s this thing that nobody knows.\u201d\n\nSuch is the concern about the spectacular growth of IHC\u2019s market capitalisation that officials in neighbouring Dubai no longer consider the possibility of reviving discussions on a future merger of its stock market with the ADX, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nErnst & Young said its review of IHC\u2019s latest financial statement, for the third quarter of last year, was \u201csubstantially less in scope\u201d than an audit along international standards and therefore E&Y was unable to obtain assurance \u201cof all significant matters\u201d.\n\nIHC said: \u201cDue to the limited amount of information that is required to be presented in an interim financial statement\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009external auditors typically do not conduct a full-fledged audit of these financial statements.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s transformation can be timed to the period Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, one of the most powerful figures in Abu Dhabi, took over as chair in 2020. As well as being the UAE\u2019s national security adviser, he is the full brother of its president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, and he oversees an expanding business empire.\n\nIn addition to his role at IHC, he chairs ADQ, a new and increasingly active state investment vehicle, First Abu Dhabi Bank, the UAE\u2019s largest lender, and Group42, an Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence and cloud computing company.\n\nHe also controls Royal Group, a holding company that owns 62 per cent of IHC. About 24 per cent of IHC\u2019s shares are freely floated, with more than 90 per cent of investors from the Gulf.\n\nShueb said Sheikh Tahnoon\u2019s vision for IHC \u201cwas limited to creating value for the shareholders\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow we create [value] is cascaded to the management,\u201d he said.\n\nHe dismissed scepticism about what had driven the rapid share price growth, saying it was a \u201clittle bit of ignorance of the bankers who are not looking at it properly\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe investor who is willing to invest at this market cap, it is only because they have done their homework well because they can see those assets have a significant value,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe people are anticipating that those certain assets that are still outside [with Royal Group] will come to the IHC group\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009which I\u2019m not denying, it\u2019s likely they will come.\u201d\n\nShueb sought to explain the group\u2019s goal as \u201cone simple thing \u2014 [to] create value for our shareholders by investing in different portfolios, not one stream of investment\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe do the acquisition, we do the synergy, immediately next we go for diversification,\u201d he said.\n\nAs an example, he said if IHC bought a telecoms company it would integrate it on the services side of IHC, and expand into \u201csolutions\u201d and \u201chardware sales\u201d. In agriculture, the plan was to supply food from \u201cfarm to table\u201d.\n\nHe added that the company has a $10bn war chest for investments and is targeting group revenue growth from $7.7bn in 2021 to $27bn in 2023, largely through acquisitions.\n\n\u201cOur five-year plan is to reach 1tn dirham [$272bn] in revenue at least, in acquisitions, and our own businesses are doing very well,\u201d Shueb said.\n\nDeals by IHC in 2022 include investing $2bn in three Mumbai-listed companies that are part of the empire of Gautam Adani, Asia\u2019s richest man, $500mn to buy a 50 per cent stake in a Turkish clean energy company, and a $2bn offer to buy up to 31.25 per cent of Colombian food group Grupo Nutresa.\n\nShueb attributed IHC profits of $6.5bn in the first nine months of 2022, a 236 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2021, largely to investments, including its stake in the Adani companies.\n\nShueb said IHC\u2019s focus was on tech, healthcare, real estate, construction, food and agribusiness and general investment. Geographically, its attention was on Asia and Latin America and it is looking for deals in markets as diverse as Turkey and Indonesia.\n\n\u201cThese are progressing economies; they have population; they have reasonable systems to support all this growth and at the end of the day, because we are from Abu Dhabi and UAE population is only 10mn, I cannot\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009reach 100mn population but I can reach 100mn through these companies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that IHC was also \u201clooking at certain deals\u201d in the US, where it already has some holdings, including a stake in Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. However, he viewed Europe as \u201ca very uncertain market right now\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are getting a lot of very good deals [in Europe], but [we] don\u2019t know if these good deals will stay good,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked why there was no independent research on the group despite its size and dominance of the ADX, Shueb said \u201cit\u2019s up to them if they want to do it or not\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen I go to the market for any IPO for my companies, I get enough questions from the local investor base\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they have enough research on our financials,\u201d he said. \u201cOur books are very open.\u201d\n\nIHC has had discussions with a credit agency about a rating, but that process hit a stumbling block when the agency asked what to compare the group with, Shueb said.\n\n\u201cThe team are still working [on the rating and] most likely will find a solution,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said IHC had debt of about 10bn dirham, excluding operating debt at portfolio companies, and would look to increase its borrowing as it expanded. The group had begun developing relations with international banks, he added, including securing a loan of \u201cseveral billion dollars\u201d from Standard Chartered and was engaging with Goldman Sachs and UBS.\n\nOthers still need convincing of the group\u2019s strategy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it because it\u2019s a $200bn market cap company that files less disclosure than entities significantly smaller than that, and the whole complex of listed and unlisted subsidies that are highly active,\u201d said another Gulf-based banker.\n\nHowever, \u201cit\u2019s such an important source of deal flow that I\u2019m sure some banks are examining what they can do,\u201d to get involved, he added.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3690cc04-ff12-42f5-aa8d-26b5c185e99d"}}, {"id": "83063554-e825-457b-b044-83a91735bc55", "event_name": "The new Gulf sovereign wealth fund boom", "blurb": "Companies are flocking to the Middle East to raise capital just as they did in 2008.

In Abu Dhabi, an annual finance conference was so packed that attendees were left with standing room only as the region is increasingly viewed as one of the remaining sources of abundant capital.\n\nWhen sessions ended, bankers and investors squeezed through corridors pitching deals on the hoof. \u201cIt was so busy, it felt like the whole island sank a little,\u201d one Abu Dhabi official quipped to a banker present.\n\nThere were similar scenes in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, where the kingdom\u2019s so-called \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d investor conference drew record numbers with more than 1,000 \u201cglobal executives\u201d attending, including about 400 from the US and scores from Europe.\n\nFor many of those beating a path to the Gulf there is one thing on their minds \u2014 luring capital from, and striking deals with, sovereign wealth funds as the region enjoys its first petrodollar-fuelled boom in a decade.\n\n\u201cYou have the world and his wife coming here looking for capital,\u201d says a veteran Gulf-based banker. \u201cIt feels like 2008.\u201d\n\nThat was the year that thrust many of the Gulf\u2019s SWFs into the spotlight as oil prices soared to a record $147 a barrel, while much of the rest of the world suffered the global financial crisis.\n\nBack then it was Abu Dhabi\u2019s stable of investment vehicles and the Kuwaiti and Qatari SWFs that made the biggest splashes. These funds became go-to investors for distressed western assets desperate to raise capital. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Barclays and Daimler were among high-profile companies and brands bolstered by injections of Gulf petrodollars.\n\nToday, the SWFs are once again eyeing opportunities amid another bout of global tumult, buoyed by petrodollar surpluses after oil prices last year reached their highest levels since 2008.\n\nWhile much of the world braces for recession, the IMF forecasts that the Middle East\u2019s oil and gas producers are set to reap up to $1.3tn in additional revenues than had been expected over the next four years as energy prices were pushed up by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Much of it will flow to the Gulf, home to top crude exporter Saudi Arabia and the largest liquefied natural gas exporter Qatar.\n\nIt is a boom that is set to bolster the soft power of the region\u2019s increasingly confident absolute monarchies, notably Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as he seeks to defuse criticism of his regime\u2019s human rights record and project the kingdom as a major G20 power.\n\n\u201cThe quantum available is massive,\u201d says an investment banker. \u201cFor the last two months, every week we have one or two companies here, primarily from the US, but also Europe, China, India, doing roadshows.\u201d\n\nYet Gulf officials caution there are differences with 2008. Although they consider this as a moment to capitalise on, this time they say the investments will be done in a more strategic and less opportunistic manner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the deal flow that is seeking us out. We want the deal flow that fits with our strategic ambitions,\u201d says Khaldoon Mubarak, chief executive of Mubadala, a $284bn Abu Dhabi sovereign fund that has investments in more than 50 countries. \u201cIn 2008 we reacted well, but this time our approach is more proactive and strategically deliberate.\u201d\n\nThe Middle East\u2019s sovereign wealth funds are bigger and more experienced than in 2008.\n\nMubadala managed assets of just $15bn during that period. Abu Dhabi, the wealthy capital of the United Arab Emirates, has also consolidated funds over the past decade after two of its vehicles \u2014 Aabar and Ipic \u2014 got sucked into Malaysia\u2019s 1MDB fraud, which became one of the world\u2019s biggest financial scandals. The $450bn Qatar Investment Authority was just three years old in 2008 and often appeared to act on impulse rather than strategy.\n\n\u201cWe were very young [in 2008] \u2014 the teams were a bit smaller and we were building the portfolio from scratch, so we were more opportunistic,\u201d says Mansoor bin Ebrahim al-Mahmoud, QIA chief executive. \u201cNowadays, it\u2019s totally different. We are mature, well established, with specialised teams and a robust asset-allocation strategy.\u201d\n\nHe is eyeing an \u201copportunity to reposition our portfolio in certain directions, to fill certain gaps or correct overexposure\u201d.\n\nYet one of the main draws for investors this time round is a fund that sat on the sidelines during the 2008 boom \u2014 Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, or PIF. It has undergone a radical reinvention since Prince Mohammed took over as chair in 2015 as it has been tasked with leading Riyadh\u2019s grandiose plans to overhaul its rentier economy.\n\nIt has committed to spending hundreds of billions of dollars at home, while using its newfound financial and political clout to diversify the kingdom\u2019s overseas exposure. It is also pursuing strategic investments to lure technology and knowhow onshore to bolster Riyadh\u2019s development plans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s massive asset management, a sovereign wealth fund, a conglomerate and a government policy extension all combined into one,\u201d says another senior investment banker, with a \u201ctremendous appetite\u201d for opportunities.\n\nRizwan Shaikh, co-head of emerging markets at Citigroup\u2019s banking, capital markets and advisory division in Emea, says: \u201cWe have to be selective in terms of who we bring in to put in front of the funds, but they are keen and want to see what\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he says the main inquiries his bank is receiving are from clients looking for capital and strategic partners. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the first thing people think about \u2014 we need strategic capital, where are the sources?\u201d\n\nThe new phase of dealmaking by the Gulf\u2019s SWFs began with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMubadala invested a record $30bn in 2021. Last year, it committed to investing \u00a310bn in the UK over five years, and has already deployed about half of it. Its younger sister, ADQ, has been on the acquisition trail across the Middle East, north Africa and Turkey. Even Adia, Abu Dhabi\u2019s most traditional and conservative SWF, has been investing at a high velocity.\n\nSome, however, believe there is still time for asset prices to fall further, meaning they are not in a rush.\n\n\u201cIs it a market where you have a lot of cheap assets and it\u2019s time to attack? No, I think there\u2019s a lot more pain that\u2019s still coming,\u201d says Mubarak, chief executive of Mubadala. \u201cWe\u2019re careful how we deploy our powder. We\u2019re well positioned in terms of liquidity and in terms of access to deal flow.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the QIA\u2019s largest investments last year include \u20ac2.4bn in German power company RWE and $1.5bn in Bodhi, James Murdoch\u2019s media venture in India. It was an anchor investor in Porsche\u2019s initial public offering.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the PIF has done fewer of the sort of big-ticket deals it did in 2016 when it took a $3.5bn stake in Uber and pumped $45bn into SoftBank\u2019s floundering Vision Fund. But it continues to be highly active, launching myriad companies at home, from a Saudi electric vehicle brand, Ceer, to coffee and aircraft leasing companies, while also trading billions of dollars in overseas stocks.\n\nThe fund\u2019s foreign exposure has surged from 9 per cent of its assets in 2017 to about a quarter in June, while the size of the fund has swelled from about $150bn seven years ago to more than $600bn. Its target is to reach more than $1tn assets under management by 2025, with about 30 per cent in international investments.\n\nNoticeable global deals this year include its decision to pump more than $3bn into gaming companies, including taking a 5 per cent stake in Nintendo.\n\nThe PIF\u2019s transformation underscores the dramatic shift in the kingdom\u2019s risk appetite and the way the leadership intends to manage its wealth. In the past, Saudi governments typically used boom periods to dispense largesse to the population through benefits, subsidies and public sector wage increases, while also embarking on a flurry of state spending on infrastructure projects.\n\nThat would propel growth in the state-dominated economy, but lead to cycles of boom and bust, with the latter characterised by yawning deficits, stalled projects and delayed payments to contractors. Any money that was saved would be tucked away at the central bank and conservatively managed.\n\nToday, much of the state spending is channelled through the PIF and a National Development Fund, which are expected to be the main beneficiaries of the recent surpluses. \u201cWe don\u2019t want money sitting idle yielding zero,\u201d says finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan, who also is a member of the PIF board.\n\nThe delicate balance Riyadh wants to strike, he says, is maintaining fiscal discipline while also taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the boom.\n\nHe insists that Riyadh has strengthened its institutional capacity to monitor the efficiency and control of state spending, saying it is using a data-driven approach to prioritise projects based on potential economic return. As an example, he cites the establishment of a \u201cspending efficiency centre\u201d, with more than 500 staff, to help avoid \u201ca rush in spending without proper plans\u201d. It has generated direct and indirect savings of $186bn since 2016, according to the ministry.\n\nThe goal, Jadaan says, is \u201chow to avoid projects from going bust when we have seen hundreds and hundreds of projects [in the past] start strong and then in the middle for whatever reason\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009are not completed\u201d.\n\nHe adds that the difference today \u201cis you are investing when there\u2019s capacity in productive assets, in assets and expenditure that will create more jobs and grow the economy\u201d.\n\nRiyadh has already used the windfall to accelerate projects, Jadaan adds, citing logistics as the kingdom plans to develop a railway network connecting the east and west, and Red Sea ports.\n\n\u201cWe are taking advantage of this moment as we speak,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are going to spend more when we have more money, and we may even borrow more.\u201d\n\nThe PIF raised $17bn in November through a syndicated loan, weeks after it raised $3bn through a green bond, a nod to the fact that even with the kingdom\u2019s oil wealth, the fund will need to borrow to meet its large commitments.\n\nSteffen Hertog, a Gulf expert at the London School of Economics, says that while the finance ministry has put in more controls on spending, it is the PIF\u2019s activities that raise concerns, adding that \u201cwe get almost no disclosure on the spending they undertake\u201d.\n\nThat the PIF, and some of the projects it oversees, are using debt also creates potential sovereign risk, he adds. Even with the windfall, questions linger about how the PIF will meet its financial commitments. Experts say just Neom, the futuristic city that is Prince Mohammed\u2019s flagship megaproject, will cost far more than $500bn originally stated.\n\n\u201cIn a way it\u2019s actually potentially even less accountable and less transparent than the previous sort of spending booms,\u201d Hertog says. \u201cIt\u2019s more speculative than the capital spending that you would have had under governments. It can create higher returns but is also riskier; some people are worried about that.\u201d\n\nA key focus among officials in Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the current boom is to utilise state funds to bring companies to their shores to support domestic development plans. It comes as economic competition heats up in the region.\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, officials talk of using the funds to help accelerate the development of tech and renewable energy hubs, as well as the emirate\u2019s financial centre, ADGM. As part of the latter strategy, Abu Dhabi is promising to commit seed capital to private equity funds willing to set up in the ADGM.\n\n\u201cThe private equity market is changing. Today there\u2019s an opportunity because most people are scaling back and we have the ability to scale up,\u201d says Mubarak, of Mubadala.\n\nYet in terms of scale and ambition, nothing compares to what the PIF is attempting to achieve in the Gulf\u2019s largest economy and most populous nation.\n\nAs it has become the dominant economic force in Saudi Arabia, it has created more than 60 new domestic companies over the past seven years. It expects to invest $40bn annually in the economy over the next decade, with its mandate covering everything from developing a new airport and airline, to incubating and growing new industries and driving vast infrastructure projects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost nationalisation in reverse,\u201d says a senior investment banker. \u201cEverything else is going to get crowded out.\u201d\n\nThe PIF\u2019s domestic strategy includes an emphasis on sectors where Riyadh believes it can expand industries utilising domestic resources, such as mining and building materials, as well as projects designed to reverse the tradition of Saudis going abroad for shopping, tourism and entertainment, and support the nation\u2019s development, including housing, healthcare and financial services.\n\nBut other areas where there is high local demand, but limited supply, such as automotives or defence, will require the PIF importing capacity through acquisitions.\n\nTo support this, the fund\u2019s MENA and international investment teams can co-ordinate on investing in foreign stocks that fit with the domestic programme. The clearest example is the PIF\u2019s 62 per cent stake in Lucid, which led to the electric vehicle maker establishing a manufacturing hub in the kingdom.\n\nHertog says Saudi Arabia in particular is likely to need to acquire majority stakes to lure that foreign direct investment it is seeking, saying \u201ccompanies could promise them all sorts of things to get capital injections\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll have a real principal agency problem \u2014 where the company wants capital, but it doesn\u2019t want to invest in Saudi,\u201d he says. \u201cYou will be back to that logic of kind of offset deals in defence, where companies have to sort of go through the motions and invest locally without really wanting to do it.\u201d\n\nPrevious efforts by Gulf states to bring industry to their shores, be it Saudi Arabia\u2019s past ambitions to develop auto manufacturing, or Abu Dhabi\u2019s plans to establish a semiconductor plant in the emirate after Mubadala pumped billions of dollars into semiconductor firm GlobalFoundries, never made it off the drawing board. And Saudi Arabia\u2019s history is littered with projects that have either stalled or failed.\n\nStill, the veteran Gulf-based banker says while it is inevitable that resources will be wasted, \u201cwhat\u2019s more striking is each country has entities that seem better able to manage the money\u201d.\n\nThe risks, he says, \u201care we go backwards in terms of greed and corruption because there\u2019s so much money around\u201d.\n\nFor now, though, the mood in the Gulf is one of confidence.\n\n\u201cWe will make mistakes, but overall I think we are doing a great job,\u201d says Jadaan. \u201cWe are very confident, [but] cautious, obviously the world is in turbulence and we are not isolated.\u201d\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nGulf state \u2018gold rush\u2019 is no more than fleeting mirage/From Zaid M Belbagi, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/33a985a5-6955-4f44-869f-82e82e620581"}}, {"id": "aff57540-08da-40f6-974f-e25cc8cd4d8d", "event_name": "Dubai suspends 30% tax on alcohol sales to boost tourism", "blurb": "Emirate seeks to consolidate its position as the Gulf\u2019s travel hotspot", "date": "2023-01-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Dubai rang in the new year by suspending a 30 per cent tax on alcohol sales as the emirate seeks to consolidate its position as the Gulf\u2019s tourism and business hotspot.\n\nThe initiative, which took effect on Sunday, will last for a year and has been described as a trial period by industry executives informed of the decision.\n\nDubai, the region\u2019s commercial and tourist centre where expatriates outnumber nationals by nine to one, has been liberalising regulations in recent years to make itself more attractive for foreign workers.\n\nThe city faces tough competition from richer neighbours that are seeking to wean themselves off hydrocarbon dependency by developing service sectors \u2014 such as hospitality and finance \u2014 that have long been the mainstay of oil-poor Dubai\u2019s economy.\n\nSaudi Arabia, which has been enticing many expatriates with bumper salaries, is developing new industries and opening up to entertainment. Once closed to tourists except pilgrims, the kingdom is promoting its historical sites and considering legalising the sale of alcohol. Qatar, having showcased itself during the Fifa World Cup, is also developing hospitality.\n\n\u201cThe cut should further support the tourism and hospitality sectors, after the strong recovery from the pandemic,\u201d said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. \u201cThe move should also be welcomed by many residents, who are predominantly expatriates.\u201d\n\nMMI, one of two Dubai firms that distribute alcohol, said it would scrap the fee for the personal licence required to purchase alcohol and reflect the tax removal across its products.\n\nAt one store in Dubai, staff were informed of the decision on the afternoon of New Year\u2019s Eve. They worked overnight through the city\u2019s multiple fireworks celebrations to relabel the stock. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen prices as low as this,\u201d said one experienced staff member.\n\nDubai, the Gulf\u2019s party capital, has for decades managed to attract more tourists and wealthy expatriate workers than its regional rivals thanks to the homegrown Muslim population\u2019s tolerance of the city\u2019s more liberal lifestyle.\n\nBut tourists regularly complain about the prohibitive cost of licensed restaurants, which tend to mark up alcohol prices four to five times. \u201cIt will be interesting to see whether this tax break is fully passed on to the consumer,\u201d said one industry executive.\n\nThe city has swung back strongly from the pandemic, luring new residents by curbing coronavirus while also keeping the economy relatively open.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has also seen Dubai emerge as a financial haven for Russians. The easing of Covid-19 restrictions in China is another potential new stream of property buyers as house valuations and rents skyrocket.\n\nAs travel returns to normal, the state-owned carrier and airports are reporting strong demand. The World Cup in Qatar supercharged the hotel sector with thousands of fans opting to stay in Dubai and fly to Doha for individual matches.\n\nObservers said the removal of the alcohol tax could be offset by the planned introduction of a 9 per cent corporate tax in June. The 30 per cent tax on alcohol sales is one of many \u201cstealth taxes\u201d generating revenue in the absence of income tax.\n\nDubai has already benefited from the United Arab Emirates\u2019 introduction of a 5 per cent sales tax in 2018. \u201cThe impact on government revenue is expected to be limited, especially with the recovery in the non-oil sectors and from earlier fiscal reforms,\u201d said Malik.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1488146c-e7ca-4f4e-a367-9e42afcd31f4"}}, {"id": "d1ec7bf1-33ec-40c9-a6d2-de4c259e9a14", "event_name": "New generation of rich spurs boom in Dubai\u2019s luxurious homes market", "blurb": "Demand soars since pandemic with owners inundated with requests to sell homes with swimming pools and terraces", "date": "2022-12-2400:00:00.0", "body": "The Tetris-like Atlantis The Royal luxury development is among the newer landmarks on Palm Jumeirah, the artificial island that is home to Dubai\u2019s elite.

Emirates Hills, an area synonymous with Dubai\u2019s uber-elite, has been hugely oversubscribed since the pandemic sent demand soaring, according to Leigh Borg, an executive partner at Luxhabitat Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\n\n\u201cDubai has always attracted millionaires and billionaires, but now they\u2019re moving here full time and they want the biggest and best homes,\u201d said Borg, who has sold 10 properties in the area worth a total of Dh420mn this year alone.\n\nValuations in Emirates Hills were at all-time highs, he noted, while fewer than 5 per cent of its more than 600 properties were actually up for sale.\n\nHis offerings include an eco-friendly solar-powered contemporary villa in Emirates Hills\u2019 most exclusive street priced at Dh349mn. \u201cThis is what the new wave of buyers are looking for: a turnkey solution, something ready to move in,\u201d he said.\n\nYet older villas that can be renovated are also popular, with some doubling in value since the pandemic to sell for Dh110mn or higher.\n\nThe surge in demand from the wealthiest buyers convinced Dubai\u2019s largest private sector developer Damac to pivot towards luxury offerings.\n\nHussain Sajwani, its chief executive, picked up on the shift last year, when homes at the group\u2019s new Cavalli Tower were snapped up for Dh20m, and a penthouse there sold for more than three times this figure. He said that he expected properties in its new luxury project next to Dubai\u2019s man-made canal to fetch up to Dh70mn.\n\nRussians, who are often attracted to waterfront apartments, have become important customers, although more established European markets were still the largest customer segment. Yet Sajwani said he expected a new influx from China, as Beijing continues to grapple with coronavirus. \u201cOur next boom will come from the Chinese,\u201d he predicted.\n\nDevelopers say the limited stock of upmarket properties will ensure that the boom is sustained, although new projects are expected to come on stream soon.\n\nForemost among them is the Palm Jebel Ali, another man-made island that is larger than the original Palm Jumeirah. Yet the project developed by government-owned Nakheel also offers a cautionary tale about the perils of property investment in Dubai.\n\nLaunched in the early 2000s, the construction of Palm Jebel Ali was put on hold during the financial crisis and then delayed until a judicial committee cancelled the project this year. It is now being relaunched under a new master plan that reflects today\u2019s much-higher valuation. The first of hundreds of villas and thousands of apartments will go on sale as early as next month.\n\nHundreds of customers held on to their original contracts for years, hoping one day to move in. Others who purchased their units in the hot secondary market could lose millions of dirhams. A group of aggrieved investors has petitioned Dubai\u2019s ruler for recompense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bewildered they cancelled the project after 19 years and at the same time launched it again with a different name at [prices] five times higher than what they sold it for originally,\u201d said Muhammad Azzam, one of those to launch a claim. \u201cWith this action, investor security loses its meaning in Dubai.\u201d\n\nNakheel has said it is offering up to one and a half times the initial payment to invest in upcoming projects on the new Palm but that it will not refund sums paid in private transactions. \u201cSettlements will\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009not be based on secondary market transactions which did not involve the company,\u201d it said.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1d6403bc-cb0a-40f2-8dad-2e2a2d099f20"}}, {"id": "6e139c18-dacf-4a60-aba9-6c7403d6c8e1", "event_name": "UAE and Ukraine open trade talks ", "blurb": "Discussions come amid western pressure on Gulf state over neutral stance in war", "date": "2022-12-0500:00:00.0", "body": "The UAE is to open trade talks with Ukraine, seeking to boost economic ties despite the Russian invasion.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has\u00a0halved bilateral trade, but officials hoped that sealing this economic partnership would restore this lost trade, especially in food stuffs, and eventually more than double trade beyond prewar levels.\n\n\u201cWe want to boost trade by eliminating trade barriers, customs, fees, standardisation, etc \u2014 this will bring huge potential for doubling of exports and imports,\u201d said Thani Al Zeyoudi, the UAE\u2019s minister of state for foreign trade. \u201cThis is a very conservative assessment \u2014 we hope to go beyond doubling.

Many match tickets have been sold to expatriates in the Gulf, including some of the 100,000-plus Britons living in the UAE.\n\nMany hotels are now operating at near full capacity anyway as travel demand has soared. In September, the last available statistics, average occupancy at the roughly 140,000 available rooms across the emirate was 71 per cent with the average daily rate around a quarter higher than 2019.\n\nDubai-based Expat Sport has brought in about 2,000 fans through its hotel and flight packages for supporters who have tickets to attend games in Qatar.

The Gulf state privately opposed the cut during the Opec meeting, only to be overruled by other members, they insisted.\n\nThe UAE, a close US ally, has sought to display a neutral stance over the war in Ukraine. In the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion in February, it irritated its western allies by abstaining on UN votes criticising Moscow.

Three months later, the US president\u2019s reward has not been the hoped-for increase in oil output, but a headline cut of 2mn barrels a day by the Opec+ group that has allied the oil cartel with Russia since 2016. Five weeks before US midterm elections in which gasoline prices could play a decisive role, this looks like a snub. It also suggests Saudi Arabia is sticking fast to its relationship with Moscow, even as Vladimir Putin escalates his war in Ukraine. The kingdom may feel it is acting in its own and the cartel\u2019s best interests, but its actions may prove a strategic error.\n\nSaudi and Opec officials insist the cuts were not politically motivated. Faced with a likely recession in Europe and elsewhere that will depress demand, they say they are attempting to put a floor under prices, protect revenues and increase capacity. After falling by a quarter since June, global crude prices are, in equivalent terms, also well below the sky-high levels natural gas and coal have reached thanks to Russia\u2019s war.\n\nYet the move to reduce production now is part of a broader struggle for control of the global oil market. Saudi Arabia has been irked by US-led attempts to influence prices. The Biden administration has pushed for price caps on Russian oil \u2014 to squeeze Moscow\u2019s revenues \u2014 from the G7 big democracies and the EU. Opec sees this as an attempt to shift the balance of power towards consuming nations, and fears such a mechanism could one day be deployed against it.\n\nThe US has also engaged in the largest ever release from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to try to tamp down crude prices, and gas prices at US pumps \u2014 an intervention as hefty as Opec\u2019s new cuts. Releases have sometimes run at about 1mn b/d, roughly equivalent to what Opec\u2019s cutbacks will amount to once the underproduction of some members compared to their quotas is factored in.\n\nThe cartel is trying to regain control of the market and demonstrate that it still has the power to set the price. Saudi Arabia is surely engaged in political signalling, too, to a US president who called it a \u201cpariah\u201d after the brutal murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and an administration it feels is giving insufficient support to Riyadh\u2019s security in the region. It aims to show it has other friends, in Beijing, New Delhi and Moscow.\n\nThe Saudi crown prince risks overplaying his hand, as he has often done in the past. China, India and Russia are unlikely to extend anything like the same security protection to Saudi Arabia that the US has done over several decades. Pushing up oil prices now may only deepen any impending recession and the resulting destruction of demand. An irate White House has hinted it may now release even more oil from America\u2019s stockpile. US lawmakers are calling to revive so-called Nopec legislation, which aims to crack down on oil cartels.\n\nThe lesson for the US and western allies is that their partners in the Gulf are not reliable when it comes to energy, and Opec is determined to maximise revenues from an asset for which demand must eventually be slashed by western-led efforts to combat climate change. It sees no obligation in the meantime to provide energy security cheaply to its customers.\n\nWestern consumer nations have few short-term, supply-side, answers other than investing in further fossil fuel production that would run counter to their climate aims. The long-term answer to all the multiple energy and climate problems they now face is the same: to make real efforts, which have so far barely begun, to reduce oil demand \u2014 and to speed up the dash to sustainable, green sources.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/96265599-5f0c-4cbe-b508-c4900c380224"}}, {"id": "1b9a1b7b-dca8-497b-9086-dc180ae7b454", "event_name": "White House accuses Opec+ of aligning with Russia", "blurb": "Oil production cuts prompt backlash from Washington amid soaring energy inflation", "date": "2022-10-0500:00:00.0", "body": "The White House has accused Opec+ of aligning with Russia after Saudi Arabia led the group in agreeing deep oil production cuts, prompting a backlash from countries battling surging energy inflation triggered by Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe Opec+ group said it would reduce production targets by 2mn barrels a day, equivalent to 2 per cent of global supply, following its first in-person meeting in two years in Vienna.

The negotiations are set to refinance 11bn UAE dirhams ($3bn) of existing debt and to raise Dh6bn ($1.63bn) to kickstart development of Palm Jebel Ali, a stalled seafront project.\n\nDemand for coastal properties has risen in recent years thanks to Dubai\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with the government keeping the economy relatively open. Russians have also settled in the United Arab Emirates as a haven from the war in Ukraine.\n\nAs the wealthy once again flock to Dubai, high energy prices are fuelling a broader boom in the oil-rich Gulf states. Financial groups are moving to the emirate as a base to service the region, where excess revenues are cushioning the blow of inflation felt more acutely elsewhere.\n\n\u201cNakheel is paying a lower spread and getting more money for new projects, including Palm Jebel Ali,\u201d said one banker on the deal.\n\nNakheel\u2019s Palm Jumeirah, the man-made island synonymous with Dubai glamour, is one of the most expensive districts in the city, registering the highest average sales rate in August \u2014 but there is barely any space left for new developments.\n\nNakheel plans to build 1,700 villas and 6,000 apartments on Palm Jebel Ali, which is one and a half times bigger than Palm Jumeirah, people aware of the matter said.\n\nAverage sales prices in the year to August were up 9 per cent \u2014 with apartments up 8 per cent and villas 16 per cent, CBRE said in a report earlier this month.

Children have been told that discussion of topics such as same-sex marriage and homosexuality is no longer allowed.\n\n\u201cEvery time we walk into the classroom, we are worried now,\u201d said one teacher.\n\nFor many, the new school directive was just the latest sign that the culture wars and clashes over identity politics in the west have arrived in the conservative Gulf states.\n\nLast week, Saudi Arabia led all six Gulf states, including the UAE, in demanding that streaming group Netflix remove shows deemed un-Islamic. The call followed a local media campaign accusing Netflix of promoting homosexuality, a criminal offence in many countries in the region.\n\nThe clashes are particularly acute in the UAE, which has a big expatriate population. The government there has liberalised laws on alcohol and divorce to attract foreign workers but it also needs to be mindful of the concerns of conservative ethnic Emiratis who are fearful that homosexuality could be decriminalised next.\n\nThe UAE, one of the more liberal Gulf states, has largely adopted a \u201cdon\u2019t\u2019 ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy, tolerating gay people who hide their sexuality. Yet increasing promotion of equality in western companies and communities has forced the issue into the open.\n\nMultinational executives have lobbied the government to decriminalise homosexuality in an effort to broaden the pool of employees willing to relocate to the UAE. An inclusive work culture, they argue, is also vital to attract and retain staff, especially in knowledge-based industries targeted by the government as part of its strategy to diversify the economy away from oil.\n\n\u201cFor cultural and creative industries to flourish, one must ensure public liberties, personal freedoms, free access to private funding \u2014 and tolerance, including for LGBTQ rights,\u201d said Mazen Hayek, a Dubai-based media consultant.\n\nLast week, US law firm Baker McKenzie cut ties with senior UAE lawyer Habib Al Mulla over Twitter posts he made in relation to a viral video in which young women gave their thoughts about contemporary womanhood. In the posts, he had suggested that other Emirati women should sue the video makers for misrepresenting UAE society. Mulla, who comments on social and legal issues from his popular Twitter account, had also previously described homosexuality as \u201cugly\u201d.\n\nBaker McKenzie issued a press release signalling the end of its partnership with Mulla, saying it wanted \u201can inclusive work environment for all\u201d.\n\nMulla refused to apologise for his comments, which he described as rooted in his religion. \u201cAs a Muslim, eastern culture here, this issue homosexuality is a no, no \u2014 society won\u2019t accept it,\u201d he said, echoing the views of many conservative Emiratis. \u201cLive your own life, but don\u2019t try to force that culture.\u201d\n\nThe UAE brooks little dissent. As a result, it may be easier for citizens to voice outrage over homosexuality and other social issues than more overtly political topics, said Mira Al Hussein, a postdoctoral researcher at Oxford university, referring to the normalisation of relations with Israel, unemployment and the rising cost of living.\n\n\u201cLGBTQ is a convenient and non-divisive topic for many Emiratis, which they can offload their rage on to without appearing to be making political statements or demands,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of these people expressing outrage on social media know they have the backing of key individuals in government.\u201d\n\nThe societal backlash is also being felt by Dubai\u2019s thriving underground gay community. \u201cPeople travel across the region to party here because it has always been seen as a more tolerant safe haven,\u201d said one gay resident. \u201cYou would see women dressed as men. Men in make-up. You name it.\u201d\n\nBut the parties had dried up in recent months, with attendees afraid of sparking the interest of the authorities, the resident added.\n\nIn English-language international schools, teachers remain on edge, as conservative parents complain to the authorities over liberal attitudes towards homosexuality and gender identity.\n\nOne teacher was encouraged to leave after a pupil told their parents that they thought he was gay. Another received a fine for \u201ccross dressing\u201d when he wore clothes of a female literary character to celebrate world book day.\n\nThe situation, added the teacher who had voiced their worry, was \u201cdifficult for any educator\u201d.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5b8fa877-82ea-42a6-aadb-9a8df4a25332"}}, {"id": "128dbbd6-fa64-4dd4-ba4e-2e5a6ffd95ea", "event_name": "Baker McKenzie seeks \u2018swift\u2019 split from UAE partner after homophobic tweets", "blurb": "Controversy highlights divide between values of western companies in region and many Emiratis", "date": "2022-09-1600:00:00.0", "body": "Baker McKenzie said it was working to ensure a \u201cco-operative and swift separation\u201d from its partner in the United Arab Emirates after controversy over social media posts in which he described homosexuality as \u201cugly\u201d.\n\nThe US law firm said on Friday that Habib Al Mulla would set up a firm independent from Baker McKenzie once the separation had been completed by early next year.\n\nAbu Dhabi-based Borys Dackiw, head of investigations, compliance and ethics in the Middle East, will lead Baker McKenzie UAE on an interim basis, focused on transactional and advisory practices.\n\nThe case highlights the sharpening divide between the values of western corporations that have flocked to the expatriate-majority UAE to take advantage of its regional hub status and the more conservative ethics of many Emirati nationals.\n\nMulla, who is one of the country\u2019s most distinguished lawyers but also comments on social issues from his popular Twitter account, sparked controversy in recent weeks over social media posts regarding Emirati identity and homosexuality. His tweets attracted widespread support among many of his compatriots.\n\nBaker McKenzie, which has a 40-year history in the region, announced a corporate divorce from its UAE partner last week, saying it wanted to \u201censure an inclusive work environment for all\u201d and that Mulla\u2019s social media comments did not represent those of the firm.\n\nThe UAE has introduced multiple social and economic reforms to entice more foreigners as the government seeks to boost growth and diversify the economy away from oil. Restrictions on alcohol and cohabitation of unmarried couples have been eased, while foreigners can now set up businesses without the need for a local UAE partner. The government also shifted its weekend to align with global markets.\n\nHowever, homosexuality remains illegal in the UAE as well as other Gulf states, which this month all demanded that Netflix remove \u201cun-Islamic\u201d content.\n\nThe emirate of Dubai has swung out of the pandemic strongly, enjoying an influx of new, wealthy residents, including Russians and Ukrainians fleeing the war.

KPMG Lower Gulf has\u00a03,400\u00a0clients, including the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and sovereign investment funds ADQ and Mubadala.\n\nThe partners call on KPMG International to bring in a turnround team to support the business to address the \u201cmassive crisis\u201d brewing in the local firm.

They also call for the suspension of the board, alleging that its independence is being undermined because some independent directors receive unusually large salaries of $500,000 or more.\n\nKPMG International should establish an independent committee to assess Haffar\u2019s performance, the email says, and install an acting chief executive from the international organisation.\n\nThe partners also highlight concerns about falling profits, which have hit their pay. At the start of Haffar\u2019s tenure as KPMG Lower Gulf chief executive in 2018, average profits per partner were around $800,000, according to the email and current and former partners. This has fallen to a projected $450,000 per partner for 2022. Partner bonuses have not yet been fully paid for 2021 because of \u201ccash flow issues\u201d, the email states.\n\nThey blame the decline in profitability on Haffar\u2019s lack of \u201ccommercial acumen\u201d, the hiring of expensive senior people who have increased overheads without improving profitability, and expensive PR campaigns aiming to boost the CEO\u2019s image in the region.\n\nTheir email also highlights a charitable contribution by KPMG Lower Gulf in April of around $272,000 to the One Billion Meals campaign, an initiative set up by the UAE prime minister\u2019s philanthropic foundation to ease global hunger. A former partner described the donation, which was widely publicised, as an \u201cextraordinary charitable contribution for a firm our size\u201d and \u201cvery unusual\u201d, adding: \u201cThis did not have a business purpose, this had a Nader purpose.\u201d\n\nKPMG Lower Gulf said it was \u201cvery proud of the contribution that the company and over 300 of its employees made to the UAE\u2019s \u201c1 Billion Meals\u201d initiative\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009The size of this contribution was in line with many other local and international brands.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cOver the past five years, and despite the impact of Covid, KPMG Lower Gulf has consistently grown year on year almost doubling its revenue, the number of partners and its employees.\u201d\n\nThe email follows a chaotic summer at KPMG Lower Gulf, which announced in July that it would rerun an election for Haffar\u2019s position as chair and chief executive following allegations that the previous process had been a sham. It also said it would hire a law firm to review its governance after the Financial Times reported criticism of its leadership and the removal of partners who had challenged Haffar.\n\nBut some partners believe the measures are simply window dressing. The email said that if KPMG International does not step in, \u201cthe culprits will be the judges and the jury here\u201d.\n\nKPMG is structured as a network of locally-owned partnerships that pay a fee to KPMG International, which manages the brand and sets global minimum standards.\n\nKPMG Lower Gulf is based in Dubai and has around 60 partners in total, of which roughly 40 are capital partners who own the 1,300-person operation.\n\nThe email will increase pressure on KPMG International, which has been accused of ignoring whistleblower complaints.

He had been repaying instalments on a restructuring agreement on the $501mn DIB loan until he was detained in 2008, thereby defaulting. The bank foreclosed on the loan\u2019s collateral, a polo-themed real estate development then valued at about $1bn.

Saudi Arabia has also held several rounds of talks with Iran over the past year in an effort to improve its relations with the Islamic republic.\n\nThe UAE recalled its ambassador in 2016, following Riyadh\u2019s decision to sever ties with Iran in the wake of protests in Tehran that targeted the Saudi mission in the republic\u2019s capital.

These include the mothballed man-made Palm Jebel Ali island and the stunted towers of Dubai Pearl, a long-delayed development at the entrance to another famous reclaimed island, Palm Jumeirah.\n\nThese developments have long acted as visible reminders of past excesses but are now reviving thanks to a wave of new entrants to the city, from Asian billionaires and cryptocurrency investors to wealthy Russians looking to escape sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDubai-based property consultants Mira Estate said sales to customers from Russia and the former Soviet states had doubled so far this year, compared to the same period in 2021.\n\n\u201cBillionaires and entrepreneurs have been flocking to the UAE in record numbers, leading to a surge in demand for real estate,\u201d said Tamara Getigezheva, Mira\u2019s chief executive. \u201cMost homebuyers are looking for ready units and waterfront properties.\u201d\n\nThe volume of transactions in Dubai\u2019s residential market soared by a third in June 2022 compared to a year before.

The company declined to comment.\n\nInvestors are being offered financial recompense or credit notes for other Nakheel properties, said three of these people.\n\nCustomers will also be given the opportunity to reinvest their cash in the revived Palm Jebel Ali, they added.

It gains exposure to one of the world\u2019s busiest ports in return for a generous outlay that will reduce DP World\u2019s debt pile.\n\nDP World took on $8.1bn of extra borrowings when it went private in 2020. The deal with CDPQ \u2014 and DP World\u2019s mooted sale of another 13 per cent slug of the assets for $3bn \u2014 should help it meet its stated goal of getting net debt from 6.9 times, as calculated by Moody\u2019s, to below four times ebitda this calendar year.\n\nIts strong free cash flow \u2014 $2.1bn last year \u2014 is partly earmarked for capital spending, estimated by Fitch to amount to about $1.5bn a year.

Subsequent newspaper headlines gleefully warned: \u201cDubai fears end of The World\u201d.\n\nThe collection of 300 man-made islands off the Gulf coast, arranged to resemble a world map and surrounded by a 27km breakwater, was announced in 2003 and intended to be the ultimate trophy real-estate project. Soon sand was being dredged, the islands began to appear and a bidding frenzy ensued; in a 2006 publicity stunt Richard Branson posed on the island representing Britain wearing a Union Jack suit.\n\nBut then came the global financial crisis, bringing the ambitious emirate into recession. Legal wrangles consumed the city. Work on the World Islands stopped but the Nakheel lawyer insisted the project wasn\u2019t dead, only merely like a patient in a \u201ccoma\u201d \u2014 implying that it would, in time, wake up and be successful.\n\nNow, a decade on, that seemingly optimistic appraisal is closer to coming true. In line with Dubai\u2019s rollercoaster history, the city\u2019s services-and tourism-oriented economy is back on the way up, buoyed first by an influx of wealthy people thanks to the United Arab Emirates\u2019 successful handling of the pandemic and, more recently, a flood of rich Russians seeking a financial haven. In December, the artificial archipelago got its first hotel: a five-star resort operated by Anantara that sits on the island representing Argentina and offers 70 beachfront villas with panoramic views of Dubai\u2019s skyscraper-strewn skyline.\n\nThere is a fitting circularity in the fact this first hotel is owned by the man who launched the World Islands, Sultan bin Sulayem, Nakheel\u2019s former chief executive and a confidante of Dubai\u2019s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.\n\n\u201cI had always envisaged the islands as a mirror of the Maldives,\u201d he told me as he strolled around the island in flip flops. \u201cI was determined to make this dream come to life.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, bin Sulayem\u2019s family firm bought 10 islands in the area of the archipelago representing South America. During Dubai\u2019s debt crisis, he was moved on from Nakheel and refocused on the company that had made his name: Dubai Ports World. The logistics powerhouse has gone on to become one of the world\u2019s largest ports operators, though its P&O Ferries unit sparked fury when it sacked 800 British seafarers in March.\n\nAs a sideline to his day job as chief executive of DP World, bin Sulayem and his children started developing the resort in 2014, as well as building a personal family home there. Anantara came on board as the operator, bringing its own style garnered from years of operations across five resorts in the Maldives. Banks declined to fund his development \u2014 so the entire cost has been funded by bin Sulayem personally. \u201cIn the next few months, once we have a track record of operations, the banks should be more comfortable to fund the next phases,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom a jetty on the Palm Jumeirah, a 15-minute transfer via speedboat provides views of Dubai landmarks such as the self-styled \u201cseven-star\u201d Burj Al Arab hotel. As the boat enters through the World\u2019s oval breakwater, the Anantara resort comes into view, its circumference marked out by a thousand coconut trees imported from Oman. Staff clap arriving guests in a ceremony aping traditions in the Maldives. Peacocks root among young plants dotted around the beachfront.\n\nInfluencer-friendly features, such as a heart-shaped rock sculpture framing Dubai\u2019s distant skyline and swings that are submerged by the rising tide, will no doubt fill Instagram timelines for years to come.\n\nThe skyscrapers of Dubai might be visible but the sense of isolation will be a comfort for grizzled residents of the metropolis, where hotel experiences often revolve around packed beaches and boozy brunches. \u201cThis is a place for those who will enjoy the Maldivian feel of an island resort but know that they still have all the attractions of Dubai on offer nearby,\u201d said James Hewitson, the hotel\u2019s general manager.\n\nIt takes a gentle 30-minute walk to circumnavigate the island and, while most of the World remains unbuilt on, a handful of other developments are visible. There are the lush surroundings of \u201cGreenland\u201d, where Sheikh Mohammed has a villa, and apartment blocks and Viking longship-themed palaces on \u201cThe Heart of Europe\u201d, a residential and hospitality complex over six islands.\n\nThe developments have alarmed conservationists worried about the impact on the marine environment, including the destruction of coral reefs and the silting of the once-aquamarine waters of the Gulf. Moreover, the toll from construction and maintenance of properties on these isolated islands raises questions over their sustainability.\n\n\u201cDredging up sand to reclaim beaches and artificial islands is a never-ending process,\u201d says Jim Krane, a fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute. \u201cWater currents, winds and rising sea levels are all working at cross purposes to Dubai\u2019s central planners. Without constant attention, the World would slip under the waves.\u201d\n\nCut off from the mainland power grid, the Anantara resort relies on a generator to power the island. \u201cEverything that\u2019s consumed [on the World] gets shipped in,\u201d says Krane, author of Dubai: The Story of the World\u2019s Fastest City. \u201cAll of this extra work adds to the cost and increases the carbon footprint \u2014 in a place that\u2019s already at the bottom of the class in carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nTo mitigate the resort\u2019s environmental impact, bin Sulayem has hired a sustainability adviser to seek out efficiencies. There are plans to install more solar panels; sewage is treated on site; drinking water is produced on the island and delivered in reusable bottles.\n\nIts maritime location is several degrees cooler than the mainland \u2014 a key attraction during the soaring heat and humidity of the Gulf summer, when temperatures can top 50C. The hotel management expects strong demand from staycations and regional visitors from the neighbouring Gulf states.\n\nFor the most part, the operation is already well-oiled. Staff are attentive but give guests some privacy, communicating via WhatsApp rather than intrusive phone calls. A Mediterranean-themed restaurant provides a buffet breakfast and all-day eating. Qamar, the fine-dining outlet, boasts a porch overlooking the sea, where they serve Arabic and Indian food, including some of the finest naan in Dubai.\n\nIt may be an ersatz Maldivian experience, but the resort nonetheless offers a unique escape for Dubai residents and a new vista for the emirate\u2019s visitors.\n\nSimeon Kerr is the FT\u2019s Gulf business correspondent\n\nFollow @ftweekend on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/85b2df01-d652-4bc8-9005-25fc2a57a093"}}, {"id": "744bf143-b19d-4de5-960f-d7565be2cec7", "event_name": "UAE eyes \u2018new paradigm\u2019 for region with Israel trade deal", "blurb": "Pact builds on growing economic links since establishment of diplomatic ties in 2020", "date": "2022-05-3100:00:00.0", "body": "The United Arab Emirates has become the first Arab state to sign a full free trade deal with Israel, building on economic links that have grown since the two states established diplomatic ties in 2020.\n\nThe economy ministers of both states signed in Dubai on Tuesday the comprehensive economic partnership agreement, which aims to advance bilateral trade to more than $10bn within five years.

Bilateral trade reached $1.06bn in the first quarter of this year, five times the previous-year period.\n\nThe UAE, alarmed at a perceived disengagement of the US from the Middle East, has been developing other allies to diversify its security arrangements. Rocket and drone attacks launched by Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen against the capital Abu Dhabi in January brought into sharp relief the UAE\u2019s vulnerability.\n\nLike neighbouring Gulf powerhouse Saudi Arabia, which has covert relations but no formal ties with Israel, the UAE shares common concerns with the Jewish state around Iran\u2019s nuclear programme and interference in the Arab world.\n\nLong before the normalisation of ties, the UAE was engaged covertly with Israel on economic and security co-operation, including Emirati investment into Israeli technology firms.\n\nDorian Barak, co-founder of the UAE-Israel Business Council, a trade promotion body, said UAE-Israel trade was already on track to exceed $2bn this year. \u201cDubai is fast becoming a hub for Israeli companies that look to south Asia, the Middle East and the Far East as markets for their goods and services,\u201d he said in a statement.

Another yacht, the $300mn Philippe Starck-designed Motor Yacht A, has been anchored for weeks in the port of Ras al-Khaimah, in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBy placing his yacht in the UAE, Melnichenko has put it beyond the reach of western governments enforcing sanctions on those deemed supportive of Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine.\n\nIts presence is a symbolic reminder of the Gulf monarchy\u2019s ambivalence towards western sanctions on Russia, allies of Putin and the wealthy businessmen who have often benefited from ties to the state.\n\nWhile the UAE government is trying to enhance measures against money laundering to exit a global dirty-money watchdog\u2019s watchlist, the economic foundation of cities such as Dubai has long been based on welcoming flows of assets and people.\n\n\u201cGiven its non-enforcement of western sanctions, the dilemma for the UAE is how to sustain its place as an open destination for capital while also appearing to be a good global citizen,\u201d said one compliance professional. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky balancing act.\u201d\n\nThe government of the Isle of Man said it had in March deregistered Melnichenko\u2019s yachts, including Motor Yacht A, because of western sanctions, saying, \u201cwe will continue to act with appropriate robustness should the situation warrant it\u201d.\n\nMarine locator services placed Motor Yacht A off the Maldives in March. The Financial Times then saw the yacht on April 18. On Saturday it remained moored opposite Ras al-Khaimah\u2019s city-centre fish market.\n\nBusinessmen in the UAE say Melnichenko, who denies affiliations to the Kremlin, held meetings there in April, but the tycoon has since returned to Moscow. A representative of Melnichenko, who has been placed under sanctions by the EU and UK as well as Switzerland and Australia, referred questions on the yacht to a lawyer who declined to comment.\n\nUAE authorities in Dubai, Ras al-Khaimah and Abu Dhabi declined to comment.\n\nEuropean officials say they have raised concerns with Emirati counterparts that the UAE could become a financial haven for Russians placed under western sanctions. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our allies to become facilitators for the Putin regime,\u201d said one.\n\nThe UAE government has said it is maintaining a neutral course through the war, calling for an end to hostilities and providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Abu Dhabi, which has developed closer ties with Moscow in recent years, has also assured its allies that sanctions-hit entities will not be able to operate in the UAE. The Gulf monarchy, which has long argued that it is not compelled to enforce other nations\u2019 sanctions, is keen to maintain its historical role as an apolitical territory focused on business.\n\nThousands of wealthy, non-sanctions-hit Russians have relocated to the UAE to escape economic uncertainty and political instability at home, even though they sometimes struggle to access the financial system. \u201cBig banks are more cautious but smaller banks are offering help to those wishing to relocate. It\u2019s just taking a lot of time,\u201d said a Russian businessman.\n\nVery wealthy Russians generally find financial institutions accommodating. Most of the wealthy elite have second passports from countries that sell nationality, such as Malta or Portugal, which facilitates the opening of new accounts with lenders that are warier of Russian passport holders.\n\nOthers have turned to alternative routes, such as cryptocurrencies and hawala, or informal money exchange services. The cost of this service has risen from 1 per cent of the transaction value to 5 per cent since the war broke out as demand surges, said one person aware of the trades.\n\nMany in the UAE see a hypocrisy in western concern over the presence of the yacht and the Russians building new lives there. \u201cSo it was OK for London to take all the oligarch money but not for Dubai?\u201d asked one lawyer.\n\nAdditional reporting by Nastassia Astrasheuskaya in Riga", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0b4d7171-f632-4901-aafe-e283a732a1a9"}}, {"id": "60271413-4e2a-4bfc-a343-8fa0c9555a52", "event_name": "First Middle East Spac lists in Abu Dhabi", "blurb": "Number of businesses in region are considering blank-cheque company option despite it falling out of fashion elsewhere", "date": "2022-05-2700:00:00.0", "body": "The first special purpose acquisition company to be listed in the Middle East closed higher on its first day of trading in Abu Dhabi on Friday.\n\nADC Acquisition Corporation, backed by the oil-rich emirate\u2019s government, is the latest in a string of blank-cheque companies from the region as liquidity surges thanks to sky-high oil prices, and domestic capital markets are busy with initial public offerings of stakes in government-linked firms.\n\nThe spate of IPOs is attracting money from outside the region, with global managers looking to take advantage of the higher-growth environment and also tap the region\u2019s sovereign funds for investment.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we aim to enhance the business environment in Abu Dhabi and contribute to establishing the UAE\u2019s capital as a leading hub for private companies seeking to go public,\u201d said Mohamed Alsuwaidi, chair of ADC and chief executive of ADQ, an Abu Dhabi state holding company that is co-sponsor of the Spac.\n\nADC, which raised about $100mn in the listing, said it would seek a target company with \u201ctheir main operations in the UAE and across the Middle East and north Africa\u201d.\n\nADC was established by ADQ and Chimera Investment, a unit of the private Royal Group, which is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE\u2019s powerful national security adviser.

On a given day, customers from as many as 30 different countries shop at the company\u2019s store in a mall in Dubai, Zegna said. \u201cIt never happened in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe outlook for luxury\u2019s two most important markets \u2014 the US and China \u2014 is looking less rosy. Citi analysts recently cut GDP growth forecasts for both the US and China, but Thomas Chauvet, head of luxury goods equity research at Citi, believes the effects will be short-term.\n\nHe expects disruptions to Chinese demand will last until the third quarter, partly because of supply chain issues weighing on recovery, but \u201cthe fundamentals are extremely strong for this market.\u201d\n\nIn spite of rising inflation in the US, credit card spending has remained at 2019 levels in recent months, according to Chauvet. \u201cIn the US brands have done a lot to improve the quality of distribution, the quality of the offering, taking control over pricing and having bigger penetration online, so I think that [the market] will be pretty solid after a bit of a slowdown,\u201d he said.\n\nZegna and Antoine Arnault, chief executive of the Berluti business of LVMH as well as the luxury conglomerate\u2019s head of communication, image and environment, were similarly confident the US luxury boom would continue, and that spending in China would recover as lockdown restrictions eased in Shanghai. \u201cWe don\u2019t look at our business there quarter to quarter, we look at a five years from and we are very optimistic,\u201d said Arnault.\n\nNot everyone believes the Chinese market will bounce back as quickly as it did when lockdown restrictions were lifted in the spring of 2020. \u201cThe impact this time is bigger and we expect recovery to take longer,\u201d said Veronique Yang, managing director at BCG China.\n\nSustainability was also top of mind for speakers at last week\u2019s summit. Valentino chair Rachid Mohamed Rachid said sustainability is \u201cvery, very high in the agenda\u201d at the Italian brand.\n\nRaw materials \u2014 from fur to leather to cotton \u2014 have a disproportionate impact on fashion labels\u2019 environmental footprints and have become a key area of investment and research for those who want to meet their sustainability targets.\n\n\u201cTwo-thirds of a brand\u2019s environmental footprint is attributable to the choice of materials,\u201d said Federica Marchionni, chief executive of Global Fashion Agenda, a non-profit organisation that pushes the industry to improve its sustainability performance.\n\nMost luxury brands and conglomerates have stepped away from fur, which for most represents a negligible percentage of sales, but almost all have remained loyal to leather, which is responsible for about half of sales at Kering, Herm\u00e8s and Prada. While Marchionni is optimistic about leather going the way of fur in the long term, many bio-based alternatives still struggle with quality and scale.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental challenge to scale is the performance and quality of the material,\u201d said Matthew Scullin, chief executive of MycoWorks, whose fine mycelium leather alternative has been used by Herm\u00e8s.\n\nLVMH has continued to use fur, namely at Fendi, and Arnault said the conglomerate doesn\u2019t plan to phase it out until the company has an alternative that makes consumers feel that \u201cthey have the same value in their hands\u201d. To this end, in April LVMH launched a two-year research programme with Fendi, Imperial College London and Central Saint Martins to develop new lab-grown fur fibres for luxury fashion.\n\nCovid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns in China, the cost of living crisis in Europe and rising interest rates in the US are making the prospect of a global recession all too real, but luxury, undeterred, keeps ploughing ahead.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow @financialtimesfashion on Instagram", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0a77a689-a8f9-4247-85b8-e5b35fce7022"}}, {"id": "08a37908-3e3a-45ea-9d90-722ef7d264b0", "event_name": "UAE\u2019s Sheikh Mohammed takes power as dynasty speculation swirls", "blurb": "Gulf state buzzes with talk that new president could choose son as heir apparent", "date": "2022-05-1900:00:00.0", "body": "As world leaders descended on the United Arab Emirates this week to offer condolences on the death of ruler Sheikh Khalifa, diplomatic circles buzzed with speculation over whether his successor Sheikh Mohammed, known as MBZ, would break with tradition and pick his son, rather than one of his brothers, as crown prince.\n\nThe nomination of a crown prince or heir apparent is used to signal stability in Abu Dhabi, the oil-rich emirate that leads the Gulf monarchy, whose ruler wields power in consultation with his siblings and other powerful clans. The UAE plays an increasingly important role across the Middle East.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s founder, Sheikh Zayed \u2014 the father of Sheikh Khalifa and Mohammed and other influential officials \u2014 had two decades ago indicated that succession should pass through his sons but many anticipate that the powerful Sheikh Mohammed, 61, will instead choose his eldest son, Sheikh Khaled.\n\n\u201cThere are obviously concerns that MBZ wants to establish his own dynasty by selecting Khaled. It would be a massive departure from the traditional power dynamics in the UAE,\u201d said Cinzia Bianco, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cMBZ is already doing centralisation \u2014 this would be hyper-centralisation.\u201d\n\nSheikh Mohammed\u2019s 18 years as heir apparent transformed Abu Dhabi, from restructuring local government operations to launching diversification programmes to prepare for a post-oil era. He cracked down on domestic dissent and intervened in regional conflicts from Libya to Yemen to prevent political Islam consolidating gains after the Arab spring.\n\nHis control deepened after Sheikh Khalifa suffered a stroke in 2014 and retired from public life. Since then, the ruling family has overseen dramatic domestic reforms seeking to secularise society and torn up the regional rule book by normalising diplomatic relations with Israel.\n\nMBZ\u2019s relative young age would make his sons a more likely choice than his brothers. \u201cMBZ could\u00a0reasonably expect to be an active leader for at least another two\u00a0decades, barring ill health or anything unexpected, so my instinct is\u00a0that he would want to name one of his sons as his crown prince,\u201d said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nEducated in the US, Sheikh Khaled, 40, started his formal government career within the security services, graduating to domestic policy in recent years, including oversight of a powerful Abu Dhabi executive agency. His profile has risen in recent years as he took on more senior government roles.\n\nIf Sheikh Mohammed elects to follow familial tradition and put forward one of his brothers, the most obvious candidate is Sheikh Tahnoon, the experienced national security adviser, analysts say.\n\nHe has played a pivotal role in the country\u2019s regional interventions over the past decade, including military operations in Yemen and Libya, while also building close relations with the security services of western allies and handling delicate diplomacy with rivals, including Iran and Turkey.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon oversees pillars of Abu Dhabi\u2019s economy, including a state holding company, ADQ, and the country\u2019s largest bank, FAB. He also has sprawling private business interests, including the IHC conglomerate, which has grown from a fish farming firm into one of Abu Dhabi\u2019s largest companies with a flurry of takeovers.\n\nAnother brother, Sheikh Mansour, deputy prime minister and owner of Manchester City football club, is also renowned for his extensive commercial interests, but has been associated with financial scandal, most notably the 1MDB fraud. Other brothers in the frame include Sheikh Hazza, who was tipped as a future crown prince a decade ago.\n\nThere is no procedure for the selection of a crown prince. Sheikh Zayed appointed Khalifa as crown prince a few years after his ascent in 1966 and before his death named MBZ as deputy crown prince. But some local observers are convinced that, for the sake of stable government, the announcement could be made after the 40-day mourning period.\n\nChristopher Davidson, associate fellow at the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, said MBZ\u2019s strength means he has the freedom to act \u201ctomorrow or next year\u201d, but that he may well allow \u201cthe dust to settle\u201d, providing some time for his son\u2019s image to be cemented in the media.\n\nMBZ could also take a leaf out of his father\u2019s playbook, nominating a brother as crown prince and his son as deputy crown prince, or a similar balancing act to give Khaled more time to grow into the role.\n\n\u201cThey are considering a few options \u2014 one is to have a de jure and a de facto crown prince,\u201d said Bianco. \u201cIt\u2019s gaining traction because there is absolutely not a consensus candidate.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1138c033-d2ce-444b-8988-01926a8dfe83"}}, {"id": "cc70f814-80e6-4212-a1df-acb619ce1b84", "event_name": "UAE president Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan dies", "blurb": "Powerful younger brother Sheikh Mohammed set to become next leader of oil-rich Gulf state", "date": "2022-05-1300:00:00.0", "body": "Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 president and ruler of oil-rich Abu Dhabi since 2004, has died aged 73, with his powerful brother set to become the Gulf state\u2019s next leader.\n\nSheikh Khalifa, who presided over the UAE\u2019s rapid economic transformation, had retired from public life after suffering a stroke in 2014. He had handed over decision-making to his half-brother, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi\u2019s powerful crown prince. Sheikh Mohammed is poised to become the next president.\n\n\u201cThe UAE has lost its righteous son and leader of the \u2018empowerment phase\u2019 and guardian of its blessed journey,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed said on Twitter.\n\nThe son of the UAE\u2019s founding president Sheikh\u00a0Zayed, Sheikh Khalifa was \u201cknown for his modest style and generous, decent nature\u201d, said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a political-science professor. \u201cAnd thanks to his capable crown prince, the country was not at a loss when he had to step back with illness. The de facto leader now becomes the de jure leader.\u201d\n\nSheikh Mohammed\u2019s complete control over political and economic affairs removes any questions about policy direction during the succession period. Under Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s leadership, the UAE has become a more prominent geopolitical player in the Middle East, intervening in an effort to check the rise of Islamism and plug a perceived gap in US commitment to the Middle East. The Gulf monarchy has also become a leading global investor while building domestic industry and financial services as it seeks to diversify away from hydrocarbons.\n\nHis ascent to the positions of ruler of Abu Dhabi and then president of the UAE creates an opening for a new crown prince. It is unclear whether he will follow tradition and choose a brother or, as many believe, pick his eldest son for the role.\n\nThe UAE gained independence from the UK in 1971. In its early days as a sovereign state, Sheikh\u00a0Khalifa\u00a0was put in charge of Abu Dhabi\u2019s development. His eponymous committee granted loans to nationals who wanted to build towers for the growing number of businesses and expatriates seeking to capitalise on the oil boom.\n\nThe move helped broaden wealth across key families in the emirate, whose nationals are now some of the world\u2019s richest. The legacy of this period is visible in downtown Abu Dhabi, developed as a Manhattan-style matrix of streets lined with skyscrapers.\n\nIn the 1990s, as his father\u2019s health declined, Sheikh\u00a0Khalifa\u00a0acted as effective president. During that period, the energetic Sheikh\u00a0Mohammed emerged with his five full brothers as the leading force within the government. The grouping includes national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon, Manchester City owner\u00a0Sheikh\u00a0Mansour and the foreign minister, Sheikh\u00a0Abdullah.\n\nWhen Sheikh Khalifa took over from his father, Abu Dhabi launched a large investment and real estate development programme led by his brother that transformed the capital as it sought to match the global ambitions of neighbouring Dubai. Over time, Sheikh\u00a0Mohammed became the go-to man for diplomats and business figures.\n\nObservers said Sheikh\u00a0Khalifa was happy to cede this outward-facing role to his more engaging and forceful brother. But\u00a0Sheikh\u00a0Khalifa still acted as a restraint on Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s growing autonomy. Wary of Abu Dhabi\u2019s sudden breakneck development, Sheikh\u00a0Khalifa\u00a0retained the final say on oil policy and public spending.\n\nWhen the UAE\u2019s second emirate of Dubai teetered on the verge of bankruptcy after the real estate crash of 2008, the city-state only avoided a sovereign default by requesting bailout loans of more than $20bn underwritten by the capital.\n\nMohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, Dubai\u2019s ruler, renamed the world\u2019s tallest tower from Burj Dubai to Burj\u00a0Khalifa on its opening in 2010. The tribute was interpreted as a recognition of Sheikh\u00a0Khalifa\u2019s help for Dubai in its hour of need.\n\nThe ministry of presidential affairs has announced a 40-day mourning period, with flags raised at half-mast and three days\u2019 closure for government entities and the private sector.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/36d350b8-180a-4e4c-8c3a-b055d261e0b7"}}, {"id": "cbae6ea9-fcd5-44bc-b5d9-96c8ca81ba4e", "event_name": "Dubai\u2019s workers struggle with cost of living crisis", "blurb": "Rare and illegal strike by Talabat food delivery drivers comes as oil and food prices rocket", "date": "2022-05-1300:00:00.0", "body": "On any normal weekday, Dubai\u2019s food delivery riders would be up and out early, but in recent days, banks of motorbikes have been parked outside their budget dormitories. \u201cThey are all sleeping,\u201d said one doorman in Bur Dubai, the central district where many cram into apartments.\n\nFood delivery riders for Talabat, a unit of Germany\u2019s Delivery Hero, have gone on an illegal strike to protest over their low wages as the rising cost of living sparks widening unrest among the poorest workers in the Gulf entrep\u00f4t, a playground for some of the world\u2019s richest people.\n\nThe rare outbreak of industrial unrest in the Gulf state comes as fuel prices have soared since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This has slashed the take-home pay of riders, who purchase their own petrol. With inflation hitting other products such as food, living standards are declining for workers who eke out a living on slim salaries.\n\n\u201cThe salaries are too low and petrol is too high. This is a problem \u2014 everyone stopped work,\u201d said one rider at Talabat, who did not want his name to be published. Last year he \u201cmade Dh2,500 ($681), now it is Dh1,500 [a month].\u201d\n\nThe Talabat walkout, which has hobbled the app\u2019s service in the country, comes after a strike this month in Dubai by employees of rival operator Deliveroo prompted the UK-based firm to drop plans to cut salaries and extend working hours.\n\nTalabat riders have called for an increase in their basic pay from Dh7.50 per food order to Dh8 or Dh9. The company said it was open to discussions \u201cthrough the right channels, and in a constructive way\u201d.\n\nTalabat, which uses 20,000 riders nationwide, said riders had gross average earnings of about Dh3,500 a month, with about 70 per cent of riders up until last week expressing satisfaction with their pay. \u201cYet, we understand economic and political realities are changing constantly, and we will always continue to listen to what riders have to say,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nStrike action and unionised labour are outlawed in the UAE, where the authorities are quick to snuff out any display of dissent, whether related to politics or economic conditions. From construction to retail, migrant workers form the backbone of Gulf economies, most of whom travel from south Asia with the aim of remitting funds back to their families.\n\n\u201cTo strike in the UAE things have to be desperate, so this is a sign of how difficult things have got for delivery drivers with recent fuel cost rises,\u201d said James Lynch, a founding director of FairSquare, a human rights research group.\n\nOne rider, who pays Dh300 a month for a bedspace in a room shared with 11 others, said desperation over the cost of living crisis overshadowed their concerns about potentially breaking the law. \u201cWe aren\u2019t blocking the roads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just staying home.\u201d\n\nOver the years construction workers have staged intermittent strike action and taxi drivers have also been known to stop work in protest at conditions. Dubai police riot squads have broken up or threatened such protests and the leaders of strike action have previously been deported.\n\nThe labour protest comes as broader economic activity in the UAE surges, thanks to an influx of new residents since the pandemic started, the entry of wealthy Russians since the Ukraine war broke out and sky-high oil prices that have boosted the Gulf\u2019s hydrocarbon-dependent economies. This new demographic of high rollers, including rich expatriates and cryptocurrency billionaires, has supported the market for property, luxury retailers and high-end restaurants across the city.\n\nBut the blue-collar majority of Dubai\u2019s 3.5mn population are struggling. Long queues have appeared outside petrol stations on the eve of government price rises, which are set every month in line with global prices. Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, forecasts inflation rising to 3.9 per cent this year from a forecast 0 per cent in 2021.\n\nWhile subsidies on utilities and food have helped limit the impact, \u201cthe sharply higher energy prices are feeding through and impacting household spending patterns,\u201d she said. Previously low inflation before the pandemic means price rises are now more keenly felt. Petrol, for example, has risen 87 per cent since 2017 while the price of milk is up 50 per cent over the same period.\n\nMany riders, not just those at Talabat, say that the decline in their take-home pay is a blow to their families in south Asia who depend on their remittances and also face rampant inflation.\n\n\u201cOur work is too dangerous and hard \u2014 I can\u2019t walk at the end of my 14-hour shifts,\u201d said Mohammed, a striking Talabat rider on Thursday. \u201cBut God decides when I die and will provide.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/17fc356f-4351-4f2d-9001-c9b4c61e4b52"}}, {"id": "970368a5-ceb3-41de-9597-c4e078cab573", "event_name": "Yorkshire dealer used illegal cash to export gold to Dubai, court told", "blurb": "Couriers arrived at Fowler Oldfield with money hidden in car door panels and black bin bags", "date": "2022-05-0400:00:00.0", "body": "A Yorkshire gold dealership at the centre of an alleged \u00a3266mn money laundering operation used illegally acquired cash deposited in its NatWest bank account to buy the precious metal, which was then shipped to Dubai and out of the reach of the UK authorities, a criminal trial has been told.\n\nA jury at Leeds Crown Court, which is hearing one of Britain\u2019s biggest money laundering prosecutions, was told that the cash had to be paid through Bradford-based Fowler Oldfield \u201cto hide its true origins and give it a veneer of respectability\u201d as part of \u00a0a \u201cvery sophisticated money laundering system\u201d.\n\nFowler Oldfield deposited up to \u00a31mn pounds of cash on some days into its NatWest account between January 2014 and September 2016, prosecutors allege.\n\nCash was taken to Fowler Oldfield\u2019s Yorkshire premises by couriers from Glasgow and Merseyside, who used plastic carrier bags and sports holdalls containing hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash which prosecutors claim came from criminal activity.\n\nSome couriers arrived with cash hidden in the door panels of cars, in black bin liners or hidden in takeaway food boxes, the trial heard.

The US also indicated that Daniel Kinahan resides on Dubai\u2019s Palm Jumeirah.\n\nThe sanctions on Daniel Kinahan, who has denied being a crime boss, have rocked the sport of boxing, where he has been credited with advising fighters and setting up bouts.\n\nTyson Fury, the world heavyweight champion, said this week that the sanctions were \u201cnone of my business\u201d. Daniel Kinahan has advised Fury in the past but the boxer said he had not done any business dealings with him \u201cfor a long time\u201d. In 2020, Fury thanked Kinahan for setting up a contest against rival Anthony Joshua. The matches never took place. Fury and Kinahan were photographed together in Dubai in February.\n\nMTK Global, a boxing agency co-founded by Daniel Kinahan in 2012, said on Wednesday that it was shutting down following the imposition of US sanctions on the Kinahans. The company, which has not itself been sanctioned, parted ways with Kinahan in 2017. It said it had faced \u201cunprecedented levels of unfair scrutiny\u201d.\n\nThe cartel, which emerged in the late 1990s, operates across Ireland, the UK, Spain and the UAE. Irish courts have branded it as \u201ca murderous organisation\u201d involved in the international trafficking of drugs and firearms, the US said.\n\nIn response to the UAE move, Ireland\u2019s minister for justice Helen McEntee said: \u201cThe net is now clearly tightening on the Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\u201d\n\nThe UAE has come under increasing scrutiny from western partners over its record in fighting money laundering. The Financial Action Task Force, a global financial crime watchdog, last month placed the UAE on its \u201cgrey list\u201d, stepping up its monitoring of the Gulf state\u2019s efforts to stem flows of dirty money.\n\nDubai, a playground for the rich, has also attracted organised criminal gangs from the UK, as well as India and former Soviet states.\n\nA combination of weak enforcement and investment opportunities for foreigners in sectors such as real estate and precious metals has created the perfect haven for criminals, according to a report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\u00a0The asset freeze targeting the Kinahans forms part of a drive to clean up the UAE\u2019s reputation and enhance co-operation with international law enforcement.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/96082e8e-bcf2-441b-b5d4-1805f5f5874d"}}, {"id": "241a098d-13da-499e-b250-ed489cec1d7b", "event_name": "Dubai Electricity & Water Authority: emirate invigorates stock market with privatisations", "blurb": "Dewa\u2019s monopoly status is one of its most attractive features", "date": "2022-04-1200:00:00.0", "body": "Investors keen on the listing of the Dubai Electricity & Water Authority bought up the shares by the bucketful on its first day of trading Tuesday.

That made it the largest initial public offering in the Middle East since Saudi Aramco in 2019. Its shares jumped 15 per cent on their debut valuing Dewa at almost $39bn.\n\nDubai has developed a reputation as a place for companies and individuals seeking lighter touch regulation, according to the Carnegie Endowment. Even so, its financial sector has fallen behind regional competitors in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh.

While Singapore has approved just a handful of crypto groups that applied for licences, Dubai has attracted several industry heavyweights in the few weeks since launching its licensing scheme.\n\nSingapore had been viewed as a budding crypto hub in Asia, after China cracked down on digital assets last year. Now, the crypto caravan has moved on as some companies turn their sights to a more receptive regulatory regime in the Gulf.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, who has moved from Singapore to Dubai, said the Gulf state\u2019s government has attracted crypto companies with its \u201copen mindset and a business friendly attitude\u201d.\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, consulted on the rules under which it will now be regulated in Dubai. In December, Binance signed an agreement with Dubai World Trade Centre, a tax-free business park, to advise on the regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies in the emirate. The Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, which was launched earlier this month, has issued Binance a licence.\n\nZhao said Binance had lobbied for the formation of a bespoke regulator, describing the decision as \u201cvery excellent\u201d, and praising Dubai authorities as \u201cthe smartest regulators and government officials any place in the world\u201d.\n\nHowever, Dubai\u2019s enthusiastic adoption of virtual assets has raised alarm in some financial circles, given the recent decision of the Financial Action Task Force, a global money laundering watchdog, to place the United Arab Emirates on its so-called \u201cgrey list\u201d of enhanced monitoring of procedures for preventing the flow of dirty money.\n\nUK and US lawyers and former regulators said a licence from the emirate will probably do little to convince western regulators that crypto exchanges are under proper supervision.\n\nThe UK has also lodged a push to become a \u201cglobal hub\u201d for crypto, after City minister John Glen declared in a speech on Monday that the country wants to be attractive to \u201cfirms that don\u2019t yet have a settled base\u201d. However, lawyers note the government will need to induce British regulators including the FCA to be more receptive to crypto operators.\n\nDubai\u2019s crypto charm offensive has quickly attracted several companies. FTX Europe, the Swiss-based arm of the exchange, in March said it would establish regional headquarters in Dubai after being granted a licence there. Singapore-based Crypto.com added a Middle East office in the city last week. BitOasis, a Dubai-based crypto exchange also received a provisional licence last week.\n\nBinance has chosen Dubai, where it already has about 200 staff across three offices, to be its regional headquarters, Zhao said. In comparison, he said: \u201cThe Singapore government takes a slightly more cautious approach.\u201d\n\nBinance\u2019s Singapore unit in December dropped its application for a licence to run a crypto business in the country after regulators ordered Binance Singapore to stop all crypto transfers with the global exchange binance.com, which the regulator placed on an investor alert list and said \u201cmay be in breach\u201d of local law.\n\nOverall, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has granted just four crypto licences, after receiving 176 applications for oversight. More than a hundred companies have been turned away, while about several dozen are still hoping for the green light.\n\n\u201cThe very low success rate at MAS is discouraging the crypto sector in Singapore,\u201d said Chia-Ling Koh, director at law firm Osborne Clarke, who compiled the figures.\n\nThe MAS also earlier this year instituted a sweeping ban on advertising for cryptocurrency, which has been interpreted as a \u201cstrong discouragement by MAS for offering crypto to consumers,\u201d according to Nizam Ismail, chief executive of crypto consultancy Ethikom. \u201cThat seemed a little harsh. It was announced and implemented overnight.\u201d\n\nIn a move ministers said would protect Singapore from \u201creputational risks\u201d, lawmakers also tightened controls this week by passing new rules that will prevent crypto companies in the city-state from doing overseas business without a licence.\n\nXue Kai Pang, chief executive of Tokocrypto, a crypto exchange in nearby Indonesia said: \u201cSingapore is definitely losing some of its shine and attractiveness\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009There are more open countries like Dubai.\u201d", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/228250b0-b5a8-48a7-8e38-513fe4af6d6f"}}, {"id": "4a3987fe-a334-43b2-8152-9150d4b36f99", "event_name": "Yemen\u2019s warring sides agree two-month truce, says UN envoy", "blurb": "Terms will allow fuel into Houthi-controlled port and flights from capital in first mutual ceasefire since 2016", "date": "2022-04-0100:00:00.0", "body": "The UN envoy to Yemen said warring parties in the country, where Iranian-backed rebels are fighting the Saudi-supported government, have accepted a two-month truce starting on Saturday.\n\nThe announcement by Hans Grundberg came days after both the Houthi rebels and the Saudi-backed government announced their own unilateral ceasefires, following an escalation in missile and drone attacks on oil installations in Saudi Arabia and retaliatory air strikes by the kingdom in Yemen.\n\nThe truce, coinciding with the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, would be the first mutually agreed ceasefire since 2016, a year after a Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen to stop the Houthis from seizing the country from the internationally recognised government.\n\nThe war, which has contributed to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from disease and malnutrition, has ground to a stalemate on most fronts.\n\n\u201cThe aim of this truce is to give Yemenis a necessary break from violence, relief from the humanitarian suffering and most importantly hope that an end to this conflict is possible,\u201d Grundberg stated.\n\nUnder the terms, the Saudi-led coalition will let fuel ships enter the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah on the Red Sea, and commercial flights will be allowed from Sana'a airport \u201cto pre-determined destinations in the region\u201d, Grundberg said. He added he would oversee the reopening of a main road that has been a key government demand.\n\nThe most recent escalation in the conflict had come after forces supported by Saudi Arabia and its coalition ally the United Arab Emirates ousted the Houthis from the strategic Shabwa province. The Houthis responded by launching missile and drone attacks on oil facilities and an airport in the UAE, while increasing their attacks on Saudi Arabia.\n\nLast month a Houthi missile attack struck an Saudi Aramco distribution facility in Jeddah as the city prepared to host a Formula One grand prix race.\n\nThe war, initially backed by the US, has become a thorn in its relationship with Saudi Arabia, with President Joe Biden ending the sales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia. But western diplomats say Saudi Arabia has been trying lately to find a way out of the war. The UAE scaled back its presence in 2019.\n\nAnalysts warned that implementing the truce would remain a challenge. \u201cLike a lot of people, I was sceptical that a ceasefire was possible, and the question I have is what the X factor was here \u2014 what convinced everyone to make the compromises needed to get here?\u201d said Peter Salisbury, senior Yemen analyst with the International Crisis Group.\n\n\u201cAs ever with these agreements, it\u2019s a total battle to get to \u2018yes\u2019.

No longer can the Houthis survive without fuel and the blockade, Iran wants to sell oil internationally, the Saudis want to get out of the conflict, and at this point there are already certain factors that make it ripe,\u201d he said.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5e68ed15-6607-42e7-9a69-d856b5481d98"}}, {"id": "9e36618e-c789-4222-b78f-9eec3bb927cc", "event_name": "Abu Dhabi state funds were used to buy Israeli spyware group NSO", "blurb": "Mubadala Capital is a top-10 investor in the private equity fund that bought the maker of Pegasus ", "date": "2022-04-0100:00:00.0", "body": "An Abu Dhabi state-owned investment company has been an investor in Israeli cyberweapon maker NSO Group since 2019, during which time NSO\u2019s Pegasus spyware has been traced to the phones of journalists, human rights activists and the estranged wife of Dubai\u2019s ruler.\n\nMubadala Capital, a unit of the $243bn fund chaired by Abu Dhabi\u2019s crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, is one of the largest investors in the \u20ac1bn private equity fund that bought NSO three years ago, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMubadala\u2019s \u20ac50mn commitment to the Novalpina Capital private equity fund \u2014 agreed in 2017 before the fund acquired NSO \u2014 means the Emirati government\u2019s money was used to buy a significant Israeli cyberweapon manufacturer even before the two countries signed a peace accord in August 2020.\n\nThe US commerce department blacklisted NSO last year, saying it had supplied software to foreign governments that had used it to \u201cmaliciously target\u201d government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics and embassy workers.

Those talks did not progress beyond preliminary conversations. Around that time, NSO said it had cancelled its contract with the UAE over the use of Pegasus to target the princess and her lawyer\u2019s phone.\n\n\u201cWe sold this technology to these countries so they can fight together our common enemy, Iran,\u201d said a senior Israeli cabinet minister. Any abuse of the software to spy on dissidents, academics or journalists is the responsibility of the nation deploying the software, not Israel, they said. \u201cThere is no regret.\u201d\n\nMubadala Capital\u2019s investment also draws it into a thorny dispute that centres on the Novalpina fund itself. Novalpina\u2019s founders Stephen Peel, Stefan Kowski and Bastian Lueken were last year stripped of control of the fund and replaced with the US consultancy firm Berkeley Research Group, after investors decided the trio had fallen out so badly they could no longer work together.\n\nBRG accused Kowski and Lueken of a \u201cmalign\u201d attempt to take back control of the fund, in a London lawsuit last month.\n\nIn response, Kowski said BRG was \u201cmismanaging\u201d the fund, and the pair said they had tried to ensure a smooth handover to BRG. They said they \u201cdid not give instructions\u201d for proceedings to be started in a Luxembourg court to put the fund\u2019s original manager, which they ran, back in charge.\n\nThe rating agency Moody\u2019s downgraded NSO\u2019s $500mn debts to the lower echelons of junk ratings in November.

Repayments eat into her 1,000 dirhams a month salary, leaving her just Dh200 ($54) to send back to her family, less than she would have saved if she had remained at home.\n\n\u201cMy mother told me to come back home \u2014 I came to change my environment, but I am better off back in Ghana,\u201d said the cleaner, who works for ADNH Compass, a joint venture between Abu Dhabi National Hotels and the UK-listed Compass Group.\n\nAdvocacy groups have long criticised the use of recruitment fees, illegal in the United Arab Emirates since 1980 and specifically barred by Expo\u2019s management. The fees are often repaid over months or years and trap poorly paid migrant workers into contracts.\n\nDozens of workers, mainly cleaners, across the Expo site told the Financial Times they had paid recruitment fees. Others, including security guards, said they had not. Interviews with 69 Expo workers conducted by advocacy group Equidem found that 83 per cent had paid illegal fees or had not received their pay in full and on time.\n\n\u201cPractically every major economy in the world is represented at Expo,\u201d said Mustafa Qadri, Equidem\u2019s founder. \u201cThe failure to protect migrant workers from forced labour practices at Expo reflects the international community\u2019s inability to conduct adequate human rights due diligence.\u201d\n\nPersistent claims of recruitment fee payments underscore concerns for worker welfare in the resource-rich region, which attracts millions of migrants in search of a better life.\n\nRecruitment fees, debt bondage and non-payment of wages remain commonplace in the UAE, according to the International Trade Union Confederation. Qatar, which has come under sustained criticism over worker rights, has argued that hosting of this year\u2019s Fifa football world cup has prompted better standards, including the introduction of a minimum wage.\n\n\u201cDespite significant attention and effort, recruitment fees remain the norm, not the exception,\u201d in the Gulf, said James Corah, head of sustainability at CCLA Investment Management. The UK-based asset manager leads a collaborative initiative backed by investor assets of more than \u00a37tn calling on companies to find and remedy instances of forced labour.\n\nWorkers at Expo hired from countries such as Nepal and Ghana jumped at the opportunity to come to the UAE to support their families and build savings for education or a property.\n\nYet across the site, a couple of dozen cleaners told the Financial Times how they had dipped into savings or borrowed thousands of dollars to pay illegal recruitment fees to agents. Cleaners employed by Swiss-owned Farnek also complained of paying recruitment fees to agents and low pay.\n\nMoney paid to recruitment agents from loans or life savings ranged from Dh2,000 to Dh8,000. Some people are still paying back the fees in instalments of up to Dh500 a month, reducing the amount they can remit to families. The payments continue even when the work is over.\n\nSeveral Indian and Sri Lankan cleaners working for Farnek also said they had paid fees of around Dh5,000 to agents in south Asia.

People briefed on discussions said the Gulf states would be more willing to co-operate if President Joe Biden addressed their security concerns, particularly Iran and Iranian backed rebels in Yemen. They are also concerned about a possible revival of the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, believing it would embolden the Islamic republic and its proxies.\n\n\u201cThe message from the Saudis and the UAE is we will come back [to the US fold], if you come back bearing a plan, and that message has been delivered,\u201d said one of the people briefed on the discussions. \u201cThey have seen the low in relations, but they are picking up a lot of signals that the Biden administration is getting the message. You\u2019re going to see headway in diplomatic activity over the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nBoth the UAE and Saudi Arabia have become increasingly disillusioned with what they consider Washington\u2019s unpredictability and disengagement. The Gulf states have forged closer relations with Putin in recent years, and both co-operate with Russia on oil production levels in Opec+.\n\nRelations between the UAE and Washington hit a low after what Abu Dhabi perceived to be the Biden administration\u2019s tepid response to a string of Houthi missile and drone attacks this year. The US did deploy additional military assets to the UAE, part of the Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen\u2019s civil war in 2015. But Abu Dhabi wants Washington to do more and reinstate a terrorist designation on the Houthis, lifted by Biden in 2021.\n\nThe UAE angered the US by abstaining on a UN Security Council vote in February condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in a public display of its frustration with the Biden administration. It also upset Washington by hosting Syrian president Bashar al-Assad last week, the first Arab state to do so since he launched a brutal war to crush the 2011 popular uprising.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been frustrated by Biden\u2019s criticism of the kingdom\u2019s human rights record, his decision to end US support for a Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis and his decision not to engage directly with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country\u2019s day-to-day ruler.\n\nBiden also ordered the release of a US intelligence report that concluded that Prince Mohammed must have authorised the 2018 operation in which Saudi agents murdered veteran journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey.\n\nA senior Biden administration official told the Financial Times that when Biden spoke to King Salman last month \u201cthey set forth an affirmative bilateral agenda from climate, to security, to energy co-operation\u201d.\u00a0 Since then, \u201cour teams have been engaged at every level,\u201d the official said, adding that they were \u201ccommitted to working together to help the Saudis strengthen their defences\u201d. The US has recently greenlighted the transfer of interceptor missiles for Saudi Arabia\u2019s Patriot air defence systems from regional countries to help the kingdom replenish its diminished stocks.\n\nWashington has described reports that Prince Mohammed and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan, the UAE\u2019s de facto leader, refused to take Biden\u2019s calls as inaccurate. \u201cNo one has asked for that [a call with between\u00a0Biden and Prince Mohammed].

Everything about P&O Ferries\u2019 sacking of 800 crew last week \u2014 the brief video statement, the coach loads of waiting replacement agency workers, the security contractors standing by \u2014 suggests it was meticulously orchestrated. Only the seafarers themselves had no prior warning. The UK government has asked the Insolvency Service to investigate whether P&O breached employment law. Whatever the precise legalities, P&O and its owner, Dubai\u2019s DP World, appear to have made a cynical calculation to rapidly shrink the ferry operator\u2019s cost base by ignoring contemporary British standards on how to treat employees \u2014 and their implicit contract with broader society.\n\nIn laying off 800 UK-based seafarers with immediate effect and no consultation, P&O showed contempt, too, for British taxpayers, who provided it with \u00a310mn in furlough support in 2020; the company also received \u00a34.4mn through a government contingency plan to keep cargo flowing. DP World paid \u00a3270mn in dividends to shareholders that year. P&O\u2019s actions also demonstrated scant regard for safety \u2014 with agency workers suddenly expected to take on skilled work on some of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes \u2014 or for the resulting supply chain disruptions.\n\nA company as large as P&O, responsible for about a third of the cross-channel ferry market with France, will no doubt have taken legal advice before its announcement. UK law stipulates a minimum 45-day consultation period when a company makes more than 100 employees redundant. This is aside from the collective bargaining arrangement P&O had with Nautilus International, the seafarers\u2019 union, which has announced a formal dispute. According to unions and an internal P&O letter, the 800 sacked crew were on Jersey-based contracts. But Nautilus has claimed their jobs still fell under UK law and protections since this was the jurisdiction specified in their contracts. Some employment lawyers also argue UK statutory protections should apply if Britain was the place of employment.\n\nFor employees, however, a UK employment tribunal would probably take a year to be heard, and they would initially bear the costs. P&O seems likely to have reckoned that, in a looming cost of living crisis, most employees would accept a package similar to what they might achieve at a tribunal, if successful, and move on. A company losing \u00a3100mn a year, hit first by the pandemic and now by inflation and soaring fuel prices, needs to restructure. But this is no way to go about it.\n\nSheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, billionaire ruler of Dubai, the state that ultimately owns P&O, could easily afford the \u00a3554mn a London court ordered him to pay his ex-wife in a high-profile divorce case last year \u2014 although the negative publicity the case generated was less easy to write off. DP World now faces its own reputational reckoning, with multiple legal challenges set to come P&O\u2019s way.\n\nThis case should be especially sensitive for a Conservative government that has insisted that UK pay in many sectors would increase, post-Brexit, as businesses would no longer be able to rely on \u201ccheap foreign labour\u201d. It highlights the need to ensure that\u00a0statutory protections for UK-based workers are strong enough and properly enforced. If P&O is found to have broken UK employment law, it should bear the legal consequences. The government should also reconsider whether its parent DP World\u2019s Gateway and Southampton ports should still benefit from its freeport scheme.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ecd8c45c-b749-4206-8482-ff13b5b037b0"}}, {"id": "8ea5a7d3-fed4-4bbf-8c34-3dd062b83729", "event_name": "Boris Johnson to push for Saudi green energy funding in Riyadh visit", "blurb": "UK prime minister accused of going \u2018cap in hand from dictator to dictator\u2019 by Labour as he seeks rise in oil output ", "date": "2022-03-1500:00:00.0", "body": "Boris Johnson is hoping to line up major Saudi investment in British renewable energy on a visit to Riyadh on Wednesday, during which he will urge the desert kingdom to increase oil production to tackle market volatility.\n\nBut ahead of the trip the UK prime minister was accused by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer of going \u201ccap in hand from dictator to dictator\u201d to beg for help, arguing that Johnson should have put in place a more balanced energy strategy years ago.\n\nJohnson will fly to the Middle East overnight on Tuesday for talks in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in an attempt to convince the two countries to help boost energy supplies and stabilise markets disrupted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.

Johnson\u2019s visit to the country has been overshadowed by the execution of 81 individuals on terrorism-related charges on March 13.\n\nStarmer told the Financial Times: \u201cGoing cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy.

Otaiba was the first senior official from an Opec member to call on the alliance to boost its production.\n\nAnalysts say Gulf producers believe that oil prices are being driven by geopolitical events rather than supply and that there is limited capacity to boost output.\n\nThe Opec+ alliance has declined to go beyond a plan agreed last year to increase production each month by 400,000 barrels a day, and some members, including Nigeria, Angola and Malaysia, have consistently failed to meet their production quotas since that deal was reached.\n\nBy January the group\u2019s total production was 900,000 b/d below its target, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nOpec spare capacity \u2014 often defined as additional production that can be brought online in 30 days and sustained for 90 days \u2014 was roughly 3.2 mn b/d in January, according to JPMorgan.\n\nThat is below both the 5mn b/d global spare capacity buffer normally required to prevent oil market volatility and the amount that would be needed to replace Russian oil in the event of a global embargo. The only producers with significant spare capacity are Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent, the UAE.\n\nGulf states have been careful to tread a neutral line on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and also want to avoid being drawn into US politics by rising petrol prices ahead of midterm election politics later this year.\n\nThe UAE angered its western partners when it abstained on a UN Security Council vote condemning Russia, in what was an expression of Abu Dhabi\u2019s frustration with the Biden administration.\n\nOfficials say the UAE has been infuriated by what it perceives as an insufficient US response to its security needs in the wake of missile and drone attacks by Iranian-aligned Yemeni rebels targeting Abu Dhabi in January.

Virtuzone, which helps companies set up in the UAE, has seen interest surge from Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians since war broke out.\n\n\u201cI am receiving 50 inquiries a day \u2014 it\u2019s booming right now,\u201d said Maryia Vinahradava, who heads Virtuzone\u2019s Russian-speaking team, citing one Russian company with about 500 employees which wants to relocate to Dubai. Before the crisis, she got a new business lead every two days.\n\n\u201cPeople are worried about business continuity,\u201d she said. \u201cOne trader had received a notification from their lawyer in Germany that they could no longer continue their trading activities with Japan and China from there and advised him to open up in the UAE.\u201d\n\nBuying property is another option for people wanting to move to the UAE. An investment of Dh750,000 ($204,000) in real estate secures three years\u2019 residence; larger investments can secure longer-term \u201cgolden visas\u201d.\n\nWhile anyone trying to move money to the UAE from banks under sanctions would \u201cface a problem\u201d, Vinahradava said, other lenders are managing to move funds into the Gulf state.\n\nWith financial institutions increasingly concerned about censure, Russians are nonetheless finding the space for basic financial transactions narrowing. Western sanctions on Russia\u2019s financial system have raised already high barriers to opening a bank account.\n\n\u201cOpening an account is difficult,\u201d said one Russian businessman based in Dubai for more than two decades. \u201cIf you have another account in a non-sanctioned country, it\u2019s fine. But if it\u2019s from Russia, then you are in trouble and at the mercy of the bank \u2014 90 per cent are rejected.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, Russians are also turning to cryptocurrencies and informal money exchanges, known as hawala, according to the businessman. \u201cThere are plenty of guys who can facilitate this out on the Palm [Jumeirah],\u201d he said, referring to the luxurious, man-made development on Dubai\u2019s coast that is popular with Russians. \u201cOnce you have the cash, or even better a banker\u2019s cheque, then it\u2019s easy to buy a property or do something else with the assets.\u201d\n\nSome real estate agents in Dubai also said higher-profile brokerages, including Knight Frank, had referred Russian clients to them. Knight Frank declined to comment. People aware of its business operations denied there was any outright ban on Russians but said all clients faced stringent due diligence for compliance purposes.\n\nThe new financial inflows come at a particularly sensitive time for the UAE, which on Friday was placed on the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s \u201cgrey list\u201d. This means increased monitoring by the inter-governmental agency of their efforts to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe UAE hosts the top names in global finance at two international centres in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Its real estate and commodities markets have long been prone to abuse by money launderers and tax evaders. After Friday\u2019s meeting, the FATF said all jurisdictions should be vigilant against money laundering that \u201crisks resulting from Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine\u201d.\n\nEmirati officials have said the country would welcome Russian investors and Ukrainian refugees while acknowledging western sanctions.\n\nLocal lenders also voiced caution. They can still open accounts for Russians, but it is \u201cno longer a simple or easy thing to do\u201d, said one banking executive. \u201cWith these new sanctions in place, banks will find it much harder to accept transfers from Russia, in any form,\u201d he said.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d6d3b45a-35cc-4e32-b864-b9c0b1649a79"}}, {"id": "7b66048d-1d53-44f4-bc3f-10865c8d09c2", "event_name": "United Arab Emirates to nudge Opec allies to increase oil production", "blurb": "Crude prices have surged after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine ignited worries over supplies", "date": "2022-03-1000:00:00.0", "body": "The United Arab Emirates will encourage fellow Opec members to increase oil production as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has driven crude prices to their highest levels in more than a decade, a senior official said.\n\nThe UAE is the first Opec member to call on the alliance to boost its production since Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, triggered a global crisis by ordering his troops into Ukraine two weeks ago.\n\nYousef al-Otaiba, the UAE\u2019s ambassador to Washington, said in a statement to the Financial Times: \u201cWe favour production increases and will be encouraging Opec to consider higher production levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe UAE has been a reliable and responsible supplier of energy to global markets for more than 50 years and believes that stability in energy markets is critical to the global economy,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Emirati ambassador\u2019s statement came a day after US President Joe Biden imposed an immediate ban on imports of Russian crude, sparking fears that other countries would follow in blocking Russian energy flows.\n\nThe Biden administration has for weeks been pressing oil producers to increase their output to help reduce prices. But the Opec+ alliance, which includes Russia, has declined to go beyond a plan agreed last year to increase production each month by 400,000 barrels a day.\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, traded as high as $131.64 a barrel on Wednesday, but pulled back sharply to about $111 following the comments from the UAE. Iraq also indicated on Wednesday that it was prepared to increase output if required.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Suhail Al Mazrouei, the UAE\u2019s energy minister, tweeted that the country remained \u201ccommitted to the Opec+ agreement and its existing monthly production adjustment mechanism\u201d.\n\nThe UAE is a close ally of Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of Opec, which has resisted US calls to raise production. However, last year Abu Dhabi became embroiled in a dispute with Riyadh over output quotas.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the UAE had co-ordinated with Saudi Arabia on its plans to encourage Opec to increase production.\n\nBut Abu Dhabi\u2019s position will be welcomed by the Biden administration, which is concerned about rising prices at American petrol pumps and the impact of soaring energy costs on the global economy.\n\nAnalysts caution that there is little spare production capacity globally, with only Saudi Arabia able to significantly raise output, and the UAE to a lesser degree. They add that even a co-ordinated move might have limited impact.\n\n\u201cThey know there is not enough spare capacity to fill a Russia-sized hole,\u201d said Amrita Sen, at Energy Aspects. She added it was not surprising that the UAE was the first Opec member to voice support for increasing production, as it had previously indicated it would like to raise its exports.\n\nSome Opec members, including Nigeria, Angola and Malaysia, have consistently failed to meet their production quotas since the most recent Opec+ agreement was reached last year.\n\nBy January the group\u2019s total production was 900,000 b/d below its target, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nMohammed Barkindo, Opec\u2019s secretary-general, warned this week that there was \u201cno capacity in the world at the moment that can replace 7mn barrels [a day] of exports\u201d from Russia.\n\nGulf states have been careful to tread a neutral line on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, partly because they co-operate in Opec+ on agreed levels of production in a more than five-year alliance that was intended to keep oil prices at sustainable levels.\n\nThe UAE is considered one of the US\u2019s most important Arab partners, but relations between Abu Dhabi and Washington have been increasingly strained in recent weeks.\n\nThe Gulf state, which took up a temporary seat on the UN Security Council this year, rankled American policymakers by abstaining on a US resolution condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe abstention reflected Abu Dhabi\u2019s mounting frustration with the Biden administration, particularly what Emirati officials perceive to be Washington\u2019s timid response to attacks on the UAE by Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen.\n\nThe US has deployed additional military assets to the UAE, which is part of a Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen\u2019s civil war in 2015 to fight the Iran-allied Houthis. But Abu Dhabi wants Washington to designate the Houthis a terrorist organisation and impose tougher sanctions on the Yemeni group.\n\nThe Biden administration has been reluctant to do so amid warnings that such a move would exacerbate Yemen\u2019s humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe UAE is also concerned about the prospects of the Biden administration sealing a deal with Iran to revive the 2015 nuclear accord, fearing it will embolden the Islamic republic and its proxies.\n\nOtaiba, who is one of the most influential Emirati officials, said last week that the UAE and the US were \u201cgoing through a stress test but I\u2019m confident that we will get out of it and get to a better place\u201d.\n\nHelima Croft, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets and a former CIA analyst, said the US still needed to offer something to Saudi Arabia if it wanted to secure the world\u2019s top oil exporter\u2019s help in driving down oil prices.\n\n\u201cWhat is in the US offer letter to Saudi Arabia to get them to essentially walk away from the Opec+ arrangement?\u201d\n\nRelations between Riyadh and Washington have been strained since Biden took office. The president has criticised the kingdom over human rights abuses, including the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, and promised to reassess relations with Saudi Arabia, and to not engage with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the day-to-day ruler.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/cd26f107-6217-4c8d-befe-11772b40ca66"}}, {"id": "17010bdc-b207-4a0d-bf8e-44d55fe14faf", "event_name": "Financial crimes watchdog puts UAE on \u2018grey list\u2019", "blurb": "Blow as Middle East\u2019s premier finance and trade hub \u2018subject to increased monitoring\u2019 ", "date": "2022-03-0400:00:00.0", "body": "The global financial crimes watchdog has placed the United Arab Emirates on its grey list, dealing a blow to the Middle East\u2019s premier finance and trade hub.\n\nThe Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) said in a report on Friday that it had added the oil-rich Gulf state to other nations \u201csubject to increased monitoring\u201d, putting the UAE on a list of 22 other nations that includes Syria, Albania, Panama and South Sudan.\n\nFATF said the UAE had made a \u201chigh-level commitment to work with the watchdog on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing and had made \u201csignificant improvements\u201d to improve it systems.\n\nBut the grey listing will hurt the reputation of the Gulf state, which has long prided itself as the destination of choice for international banks and multinationals operating in the Middle East.\n\nThe UAE, and Dubai in particular, has long garnered a reputation for the ease of moving large sums of cash in and out of the nation and lax scrutiny in sectors such as real estate deals.\n\nInclusion on the FATF\u2019s watchlist is not expected to deter financial institutions looking to set up in the UAE, Gulf-based bankers have previously said. But the reputational damage could raise costs for local banks doing business with global counterparts and complicate compliance issues for international lenders.\n\nIn 2020, the FATF said the UAE\u2019s limited number of money-laundering prosecutions, especially in Dubai, were a \u201cconcern\u201d and urged the country to strengthen its anti-money laundering measures.\n\nAhead of the report, Emirati officials said the UAE had taken many steps to address the FATF\u2019s concerns and had significantly increased the authorities\u2019 ability to clamp down on flows of \u201cdirty money\u201d in all seven emirates of the federation.\n\nThis has included creating a register of corporate beneficial ownership that can supply requested information to international counterparties in just three days. The UAE has also signed extradition treaty agreements with 33 countries including the UK, India and China.\n\nSectors prone to financial abuse, such as real estate, have been brought under the umbrella of the federally managed anti-money laundering reporting system.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s Executive Office of Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism said late on Friday after the report\u2019s release that the Gulf state takes \u201cits role in protecting the integrity of the global financial system extremely seriously\u201d.\n\nIt added in a statement that it would work closely with the FATF \u201cto quickly remedy the areas of improvement identified\u201d.\n\n\u201cOn this basis, the UAE will continue its ongoing efforts to identify, disrupt and punish criminals and illicit financial networks in line with FATF\u2019s findings and the UAE\u2019s National Action Plan, as well as through close co-ordination with our international partners,\u201d it said.\n\nFATF said that as part of an action plan, the UAE must provide additional resources to its financial intelligence unit to strengthen its analysis function and ability to pursue high-risk money laundering threats; demonstrate a sustained increase in effective investigations and prosecutions of different types of money laundering; and proactively identify and combat sanctions evasion.", "region_codes": ["AE"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7b93180f-c4ae-442d-bf71-60e340b736f0"}}]
